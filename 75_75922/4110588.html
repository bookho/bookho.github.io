			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Quinn was kneeling in the same place, and even the wine glass in his hand fell to the ground without notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of seeing her, his mind involuntarily emerged two names - the former accompanied him most of his life, but lost his love In the end, the latter is the lost love, and the person who can never meet again. Despite nearly a decade of separation, her head has become much taller and more outstanding, but he can still tell that the two are so close that he almost blurted out the name of the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Father, do you know her?" Horn's words made him finally recover from the shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovford slowly stood up and asked, "Are you... Andrea?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? You said that she is...that, that has passed away..." Horne widened his eyes and looked back and forth at the two people, snarling in disbelief. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, really Missy!" The old housekeeper's look is more excited than anyone else. "I will never admit it. She has inherited all the ladies." Features!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you still remember me," Andrea said with no expression. "Then the next thing is much easier to talk about." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoffford couldn’t help but scream, the daughter’s awakening as a witch is a secret for most people, even her mother, herself The wife of Feinah is also in the drums. When Serving on Andrea's servant told him about it, he made a decisive decision - to push the informed servant into the river, pretending to be an accident, and using his cronies to plan the carriage crash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he knows that this may make the other person hate himself, but for the farewell, hate is also a commemorative method. Only once again met, such indifferent feelings became a sharp thorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when he was not sure whether the original practice was correct, the tingling sensation became more apparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Earl knows that there is more important thing now - why Andrea will appear in Glow City, her identity is true or false, and that The sentence "I don't think so" is what it means. These are more important than questioning the right or wrong in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed all the doubts and thoughts in his heart and waved to Horne, "Go out first."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father!" the latter worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do as I said!" Hofford's tone is beyond doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his mind has been decided, Horn just barely left the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t alarm other people,” the count then told the housekeeper. “At the same time, the courtyard door was closed and the lights in the hall were extinguished. From now on, I said that I was drafting the instrument. No one would bother me. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will do it! But..." I touched my head. "What about those friends brought by Missy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friends?" He looked at Andreia suspiciously. "First take Go to the banquet hall and have a good time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, lord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With The door slammed shut and the study room suddenly fell silent. The two men looked at each other for a long time, until the count couldn't help but break the silence. "Although you and my daughter are quite similar, I can't be so rashly determined that you must be Andrea. After all, she was only sixteen when she left, and now it has been ten years..." He paused. "I mean, do you have other ways to prove your identity?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he already believes in the origin of the other party, so the question is just to find a certainty - even the perfect easy way, can not change a person's inner. From her every move, the count can see the shadow of the flower of the glow of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
