			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to past practice, the messengers who met other kingdoms were generally arranged in the temple, but now it has just cleaned up the collapsed ceiling gravel, and the restoration is still in the foreseeable future. . Thinking of this, Tiefko had another point in his hatred of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take them to my study," he indulged for a moment and finally decided to entertain him at the palace. It is rude to say that the messenger is in the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the other party’s intentions, there are ten ** in order to seek assistance – not on food, or on cold materials. There is a saying among the nobility, the summer is connected with friends, and the winter is the enemy. It is also true that it is placed between the kingdom and the kingdom. Tiffco shook his head in secret, and there were still a lot of things to do on his side. Let the messenger go early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the study, the two messenger members have been waiting for a long time with Sir Brent. Seeing His Majesty, the two men got up and bowed and bowed. "The King of the Grey Fortress, Wimbledon IV, the King of the Morning, asked us to pay tribute to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Also say hello to him," Tiefco nodded casually. "Sit down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that this man and woman are very young and faceless It is also quite close. The family emblem of the chest is the stag scepter. If you remember correctly, they should come from the well-known Luoxi family in the morning kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what is the thought of Miss Mirasa IV, the king of the morning? The guy who actually sent Mao to not be a long-term negotiator as a "begging"? Tiffco was slightly surprised. The aristocrats of this age were mostly arrogant, and they were much worse than the old guys who were crying at the negotiating table to help the dead skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you all members of the Julu family?" Tiefco pointed to his chest. "I have had a relationship with the Duke of Los Angeles." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s true, Your Majesty," the young man smiled. "My name is Otto Loh, this is my sister, Belinda Lo." Brook."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually still a brother and sister, he raised his brow, and in this case, he does not need to accompany them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now it is the time of the evil moon, I don’t know why the king of the morning sent you to come here?" Tiefco took the lead, "if it is I need food, cotton or burlap urgently. I can only move out of my own royal palace to express my heart. You should know that the king of war has ruined the kingdom, and many places have been paralyzed. Just to relieve the refugees, let the king There is not much left in the grain, and it is difficult to extract more supplies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I deeply regret this matter," Alto raised his chest, "but the meter Sarah IV sent us here not to seek assistance, but to deal with even greater threats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His remarks Tiffco gave a slight glimpse, "What threat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Church, Your Majesty," Belinda said. "The church now has encroached on the winter." And the wolf heart, a large number of fugitives poured into the morning sun - according to the news they brought, the church's means are extremely bad, seriously violated The rules of engagement between the nobility, they hanged or exiled the resisters, only to completely fall to their nobility, can live and survive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is intended to eliminate the nobility and completely integrate the territory into the control of the church. "Alto's tone is quite heavy." Misara IV believes that the wolf heart will not be their last goal, and the morning and gray castles are in a precarious situation. In the coming year, the church is likely to launch a new war and bring the war to our land. The king of the morning hopes that the two countries can unite and join hands against the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Are you sure that the Wolf Heart City has been compromised?" He couldn't help but frown after listening to the other party's statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's true, sire." The two nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the war of aggression in the church, Tefco was slightly heard, but did not expect that the other party actually captured the two kingdoms in such a short period of time. If they are not flustered, the strength of the church is too horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this kind of thing has to be confirmed by the intelligence minister. The snow of the evil demon that came early in the way has blocked the caravan’s journey. He has not been there for a long time. Received the message of the Wolfheart Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
