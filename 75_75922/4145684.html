			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reason is very simple," Itis did not wait for everyone to ask, but explained directly, "Cage Mountain is a branch that spreads horizontally from the desolate mountains. It is also the highest point on the dawn boundary. This idea is similar to the original desperate defense. With the advantage of terrain, the first army's artillery units can have a wider range of attacks, and the enemy's ability to move will be limited. After all, flying fears The number is much lower than the lowest madness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secondly, according to Takilla, the red fog is more likely to accumulate in the lower part, and the more The weaker the edge, the establishment of a line of defense at a high point is conducive to the witch's presence. From the front line information just learned, this is a precaution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In the end, it’s the dawn plan of the Majesty – “When it comes to her, she looks around. “We all know that this plan relies on the ore in the cage mountains. Before the alternatives have been found, the cage is an area that we must not give up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in the hall raised doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, none of them have seen the final product of the Twilight Project, and it is hard to imagine how much energy the microballs are incomprehensible, just relying on Roland In a word, it is regarded as one of the core objectives of the future strategy. This feeling has to be said to make Roland feel very gratified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the highest ideal in the minds of science and engineering dogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we can't completely give up the winter and the wolf heart." He looked at Isis. "If you want to win the war, the gray castle needs a large population. OK."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, so from the time when the red fog appeared to spread completely, the main task of the First Army was to migrate the population and delay the enemy as much as possible. The pace of advancement. I think the devil should not wait for the red fog to slowly spread out. They are likely to use this momentum to build a large number of outposts, just like four hundred years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northland Pearls paused, "To be honest, the sudden advance of the Red Moon can even be regarded as helping the First Army, and truly seeing the enemy of the aliens, the winter and the wolf heart. People will naturally understand which side to choose. At that time, even if the iron axe shuts them out, they will probably beg to the gray fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Speaking of this, she raised her mouth and revealed a hint of a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if this would kill a lot of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, most humans do, he can now feel the joy of Itis - it will probably be seen in later generations The news said that the residents of the community who resisted the signal tower finally got the same signal as they did. But before this battle of destiny, he could not sit and watch those people regardless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gold No. 2 in all parts of the world should have a bumper harvest this year," Roland told Barov. "You plan a plan to mobilize some of the grain for the morning." To ensure that those who fled the occupied land can fill their stomachs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, if I am not mistaken, once the information is confirmed, the first army The main force will soon move toward the cage mountain, which is already a very big pressure on logistics. "The boss is showing a difficult color. "I really don't have the confidence to deliver the troops, but also ensure that the food for the refugees arrives in time. Even if the boat of the Fjord Chamber of Commerce is fully rented, it may not be enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unavoidable problem, even the largest sail in the fjord. The sea-going ship’s capacity was far from enough before a full-scale war. Now it’s just a transport mover, and the rented fleet is running at full capacity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless...we can build a railway that goes straight to the neighboring country..." Barov said this was quite tangled, apparently he was The cost of a large-scale project is well known. Whenever you want to use the treasury funds, he is more than just cutting his own meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’m afraid it’s too late,” Roland shook his head. “And no winter city has invested too much resources on the fertile railway line and wants to copy it to the morning kingdom. This will affect the production of other projects.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the fascinating forest to the ruins of Takula, this long river of steel on the fertile plains I have gone to countless steels and a construction period of one and a half years. This is still the case where the first half is repaired by the leaves and the second half is built on the flat ground. The terrain between the winter city and the cage mountain is obviously not as clear as that of the fertile soil. The construction period is an unpredictable value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First make plans according to the current situation. Don't save money. It's fine to use most of the Golden Dragons. It's not awkward now." Roland said, "As for logistics, I think about it again."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following, squatting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then looked at Isis, "with cage mountain as the dividing line The concept is feasible in principle, and the General Staff Department will make a plan as soon as possible, and then meet and discuss it one by one.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the North Pearl, these are routine processes. He also believes that with the talent of the other party, even if he does not have to say more, he can also perceive the urgency of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please leave it to me." Itis stroked her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stood up and glanced at everyone in the hall. "I said before, the third battle of God will be a decision. The war of human destiny, now it has arrived. The victory of Takira’s battle is enough to prove that the defeat of four hundred years ago is not impossible to rewrite. I hope that you can do your duty and play an indelible role in this war. History must be I will remember this day!" He sighed. "Listen, no matter who the enemy is, I have only one requirement - this war can only win, not defeat!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As you wish, kneel!" everyone answered in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day is destined to be a sleepless night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as everyone left the Castle Conference Hall, Roland stopped Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have something to say to you alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the office, Roland let the nightingale leave first, then closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly picked up her eyebrows. "Can't you listen to the night? It seems that you don't seem to be looking for me to ask about the training situation of the Air Knights." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not answer, but poured each other a cup of iced mint flavored chaotic drink. Its taste is not equal, but it has a good effect in relieving emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Roland didn’t open his mouth, Tilly didn’t ask for it any more, but sipped his drink in a small mouth, as if waiting for him to break the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland gaze at the "nominal" sister, the mood is extremely complicated, compared to the former five-woman, now Tilly Wimbledon Just like a lot of calm, whether it is expression or manner, it is more like a leader. However, compared with the current appearance, he still prefers to see the big winter nest around Anna, casually swaying his feet, flipping through a pile of books and laughing and discussing how to solve problems to stump other sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, after all, people can’t always be the same, but Tilly’s change is too fast, from the ashes to the crying. In just a few days, she completely faded the childishness. Not only that, but her hatred of the devil is also deeply imprinted in her eyes, although it is rarely mentioned later, Roland feels a strong uneasiness from the "single request" of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an incomparable attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the whole world has lost color for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he knows from 岚 that this is not irreparable. Taking into account the credibility of the intelligence of the conscious world, the most prudent approach should be to make the resurrection of the ashes and then tell Tilly to avoid the great disappointment after the hope of defeat, but he also realized that according to Tilly’s mentality at the moment, It may not be possible to successfully pass the battle of divineity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking out, maybe it will bring her back to life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you fail to achieve it in the end, you will fall into deeper despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was these two thoughts that entangled each other that made him unable to speak for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is always a time limit for silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
