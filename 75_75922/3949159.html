			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time he locked himself in the room, he remembered the world all over again, and the dinner was sent directly by the servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the strong thought of wanting to live, Roland suppressed the fear and discomfort of the unfamiliar environment after the crossing. He knows very well that getting more information as early as possible can reduce the risk of exposure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that there is nothing else in the head of the four princes except for the cousin of the group, and Roland has not recalled any valuable information. - such as aristocratic knowledge, political situation, neighboring foreign affairs or something. As for some basic common sense, like the city name and the big event year, he is also unable to connect with the European history he knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this is absolutely no way to the throne. Perhaps the king of the Grey Fort is also aware of this, only to throw him to such a ghost place - even If you are tempted to do nothing, there will be no major damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those brothers and sisters... Roland looked back a little, and only left to laugh and cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big brother is very powerful, the second brother is very insidious, the third sister is fierce, and the five sisters are too clever. This is the impression left by the four princes. What should he say? After ten years of getting along, the final impression was summarized in just a few words. What forces they have cultivated, who they are, what they are good at, and what they are good at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only three months before coming to Bianbu Town. The nobility here no longer concealed his contempt. It is obvious that the Four Princes are not the leader of the leadership. Fortunately, when leaving Wangcheng, Wimbledon III also sent a text and a martial arts to help themselves, otherwise it was really black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the waitress Tyre reminded Roland three times and five times that the assistant minister wanted to see himself. It seems that there is no way to drag it anymore. He touched the two women's ass according to the convention in memory and told her to inform Barov to go to the living room to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Tyreâ€™s face flushing out of the door, Roland suddenly remembered that since it was farming, would it be accompanied by a system or something? He yawned and meditation in the system for dozens of times, and the fart did not happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, novels are deceptive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Barov, who was waiting in the living room, had already been restless. When he saw Roland, he greeted him. "His Royal Highness, why didn't you order hanging yesterday?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What is the relationship one day, one day later," Roland clap his hands and told the attendant to have breakfast. "Sit down and say slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems and in memory The impression is right, he thought, the chief knight always encountered problems in the face of doubt, and the assistant minister will explain it privately. In any case, the loyalty of the two is still reliable - although it is likely to be seen in the king's part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There may be other witches in the night, Prince His Royal Highness! This is not the same as the little things before, and can't be messed up by sex!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you even say this?" Roland frowned and asked, "I thought you could get rumors and facts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Barov looks confused, "What rumors?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evil witch, the devil's messenger," Roland did not think "Isn't this all the propaganda of the church? I don't want to intervene here. I think it's better to go against it. They advocate that witches are evil. We don't want to hunt witches, but we also want to preach this to the people in the territory." It is a shameless rumor spread by the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barov stunned, "Can...but the witch..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it really evil?" Roland asked, "For example?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant minister was silent for a moment and seemed to think about whether the prince was Take fun of him, "Your Highness, this problem can discuss later, I know you do not like church, but the way this conflict is counterproductive." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
