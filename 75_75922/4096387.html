			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insane, this guy... absolutely crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George.Nari can’t believe that this is really going to happen. Why does the new king think that they will not resist, but what if they don’t resist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With six people fighting more than sixty people, is it true that these guards are all iron? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the other side has a witch, there is no chance of winning in front of the nobility who wears the stone of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the order of the new king, the six female guards did not rush, but separated the two in front of the exit and Roland, and the other four pulled out Short swords, step by step toward the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sound of a sword in the crowd - in the case of such a disparity in strength, no one was willing to lay down his arms and surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, squat...!" The lord of Chishui City changed color. "Everyone is calm, there are opinions that can be discussed slowly!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that this is too late, George and Guy look at each other and immediately confirm each other’s ideas. Plan changes and start in this mountain village! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this place is not suitable for defense, but the victory in the Chishui aristocracy has basically arrived, as long as it can control Roland, he is sure to pull most of it to his side. Come - as the four princes said, power is the standard for measuring everything, but unfortunately in the lakeside villa, the power does not stand on the other side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't accept it!" Gay screamed and walked out of the crowd with a sword - he finally changed his formerly good-looking look and became serious. "If it is a well-founded trial, I have nothing to say, but this kind of ruling, any real aristocrat is hard to die. Even if Wimbledon III asks me, I still insist on this answer! Your Highness This is what you forced me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is followed by four tall attendants, each standing upright, not afraid of the opponent is the royal family. From the momentum point of view, the Earl of Sanhe even overwhelmed the new king and his party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being beautiful, George conceived, a declaration of righteous words like this, even the prince is hard to refute. The latter part of the sentence is to include all the nobles, both inspiration and inflammatory, and then just take Roland to get a hammer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other party must not think, the nearly forty, who looks like a half-haired gray count, is an absolute good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gay Yurian was born with a strange power. At the age of fifteen, he took two knights to clear a band of robbers who were entrenched in the river. It is also proficient in all kinds of weapons, and it is difficult for rivals in the comparison between nobles. Some people call him "Giant" Gay, and believe that if he is not a big aristocrat, but a knight, then the history book will record the name of the strongest knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the four attendants, all of them are the level of the quasi-knight, as long as the new king guards are entangled, Roland Wimbledon is in front of the Earl of Three Rivers. No power to fight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go up and help him," George told his attendant, "Follow Miss Itis."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Several more people out of the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the big step forward, the smile on Roland’s face is not diminished, but rather stronger, it seems that he is completely unaware of the current situation. This made George clench his fists. Laugh, this is also your last favorite moment, and the meeting will only make you cry and cry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up!" When the distance between the two sides was close to ten steps, Guy jerked and slammed the sword straight toward the female guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the road, even the sound of the whistling sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attack can only be avoided, never to resist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once the other party let go, there was no one in front of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then George heard two voices. The former was the sound of a metal collision, crisp and sweet, while the latter was the slight friction of the blade and the physical contact. The half-length sword vacated and slammed into the wooden floor after a few turns in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the head of the Earl of Three Rivers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It smoothly slides down from the neck, slamming on the floor, bouncing twice, no longer moving, the blood falling from the fracture is drawn A bright red arc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end...what happened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party actually used only one sword, and even with the weapon, cut off the "giant" Guy's neck? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this possible! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before he came back, the crowd was screaming around the crowd and the screams of chaos - the sword was like a signal. The four female guards slashed at the same time in several directions, and suddenly set off a storm. George was horrified to find that these people's movements were almost impossible to capture with the naked eye, and their strength was amazing. Anything could be a deadly weapon in their hands. Even fists and fingers were hurt, as if The nobles are not fighting humans, but a steel statue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monsters, this is a group of monsters, he groaned in his heart, how can mortals temper their bodies to this point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But...if you have a rebellious move, the rebellion becomes a practical action, and the mine will naturally not be able to accommodate you anymore. Your destiny is only a dead end. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, George Nari suddenly remembered the words of the new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s like a flash of lightning in his mind-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the other side wait for this? A moment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his neck hard and looked at the direction in which Roland Wimbledon stood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unstoppable chill rises from the soles of his feet and straightens his back - at this moment he finds himself finally reading the meaning of the smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a complete trap! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliberately left the First Army outside the city, with only a hundred guards accompanying the banquet, only six guards were admitted to the banquet; pretending to watch Unclear the situation is tough, and does not give people the space to retreat. All these acts are just to lure them to shoot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandon mine? No... The other party simply did not intend to let go of the remaining aristocrats. If they are shackled, I am afraid that the new king will only feel extremely disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes... that is the smile of expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that they will follow the trajectory of his steps to the abyss and expect them to dig their own graves - the only way to make the new king feel happy. It was just that this smile was malicious to George, so he didn't notice the smile he deserved, but he felt very cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put and let us go..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I surrender!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me too, the Leviathan family vowed to pledge allegiance to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want? I will give you! I beg you to forgive me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has turned sharply, and the aristocrats who have seen the situation have been pleading for mercy, clearly they still have a majority, the enemy only Four, but the scene is surrounded by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late, George was unable to hang down the sword, and when the people pulled their weapons from their waists, they became the rebels in Roland's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unwilling, grievances, fears and angers alternately appear, but ultimately they are attributed to nothingness under a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
