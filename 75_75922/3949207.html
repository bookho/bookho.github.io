			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS. Bringing today's update, by the way, pull the ticket to the "Starting Point" 515 Fan Festival, each person has 8 tickets, and the voting also sends the starting currency. I beg you to support and appreciate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland blinked his eyes, what is this? If the variation of the evil beast is still within the biological category, and if it can barely be understood, the monster in front of him is obviously as absurd as a horror movie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking from afar, it is like a giant tortoise with two heads. When you walked closer, you found out that it was actually two wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a test of the Frankenstein? Roland thought that the giant evil beast is almost the same height as the city wall. It is about six meters long and has six feet. It is shaped like a rhinoceros leg and short and thick. However, the size of one foot is worth the adult's torso. And the head...the two wolves are not like the double-headed monsters that are common in movies. Do you want to roar and scream, or to bite each other, showing who is not convinced. They are just low and low, their eyes are ignorant, and they are moving slowly like a walking dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking thing is the carapace behind the evil beast. The taupe surface is dull and dull, covered with algae, and the light looks hard. extraordinary. Like the turtle shell, it covers from the beginning to the end. If the monster can also shrink into the shell like a tortoise, it is really difficult to get rid of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland is not worried, a beast that moves so slowly is destined to be a target, even if the gun cannot penetrate the carapace, the exposed wolf is always Yes. If you shrink into the shell, just blow it up with explosives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Highness, this is a mixed species," the iron axe leaned nervously. "I probably understand why there are different kinds of evil beet clusters. They should be driven by this hybrid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a lion driving a flock? Roland nodded. "This is very different from the one you met last time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was the first time I saw this type of blend. Kind, although it looks awkward, you should never care about it. As long as it is a mixed species, I am afraid it will not be easy to deal with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is fast entering the range," Roland said, "Try first with a bow and arrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there is a small snow in the sky, and the northerly wind is changing, it is not suitable for archery weather. But the two hunters selected by the iron axe looked confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They boarded the watchtower and identified the downwind and threw the arrow into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sharp arrows are like eyes that grow up to the highest point, and under the influence of wind and gravity, fall on the target carapace at almost vertical angles. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As expected, the arrow was bounced directly, and Roland’s brain even sounded a bouncing sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not panic, continued to pull the arrow, and soon shot two waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last round of volleys received the effect, the range of the drop is in the front of the monster, one of the sharp arrows falls on the wolf's head accurately, and the other one Inserted into the neck of the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the other party did not scream or speed up the sprint, it just paused for a moment, then retracted the head and feet into the shell and continued to advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change made everyone stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil beast looks like a tank that has lowered the ground at the moment, and the lower edge of the carapace is almost on the ground, so that even the best shooter It is also impossible to shoot an arrow into its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the firearm," Roland ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only fifty feet left in the city wall. Even if you don’t have a rifle, you don’t have to worry about shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter and Iron Axe and others immediately approached the retaining wall and placed the barrel horizontally on the wall, aiming and shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the strength of this layer of armor is still in the carbon-based biological category, he thought, but the texture of the lead pellet is too soft, it is easy to deform, it is not suitable for penetrating thick armor. It is unrealistic to rely on these four guns to break the shell of the mixed species. Only the explosives are included. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judgment of the iron axe is the same as that of the prince. He immediately points out the team of the pike team and orders him to carry the explosives. At this time, the evil beast has already stood on the wall. . After feeling no longer able to go further, its carapace actually shook quickly, repeatedly hitting the wall at a very high frequency like a hammer, suddenly the stone chips splashed, and several cracks spread quickly along the cement bond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone wall has a strong compressive capacity, but the tensile and shear properties are extremely poor, that is, the resistance to vibration is almost zero. The people standing on the wall felt a strong vibration. Soon, a squeaky friction sounded into the ears of the people. The mixed carapace had cut the wall out of the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact has not stopped, it starts moving again, embedding the entire front of the body into the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The militia fled the wall that had been cracked, and Roland was picked up by the invisible nightingale and jumped directly from the wall - if someone stared at this time If you are a prince, you will find that when he landed, his feet were hanging, like a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Fanna rushed with a pack of explosives, he was surprised to find that the middle section of the wall had been knocked open a nearly nine-foot-wide hole across the wall. The evil beast stopped vibrating and still kept moving at the previous speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry!" the iron axe shouted, "Ignite it, put it at the foot of this animal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna, although his hands were trembling, his mind was unexpectedly awake, and every detail of the operation of the explosives package in the training came to the forefront. Unlike the test article, the official product has reduced the charge, which is packaged in wood, and the scrap and the wood are filled with scrap fragments. At the same time, the ignition design is optimized, and the drawing ignition of vermiculite and copper wire is adopted. If it fails, there is still a normal ignition lead at the end of the package. He hurriedly ripped open the outermost oil-impregnated fabric, clasped the exposed copper wire elbow, exhausted all his strength, slammed it, and there was a rush of sizzling sound in the wooden box, followed by smoke. - That is the sign of a successful ignition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This salt-soaked lead burns slowly and takes about ten minutes. When Fanna saw white smoke in the box, the surrounding world seemed to be quiet. He has seen the power of this thing, if he blasts in his hands, he is afraid that he will not have even a piece of body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine interest rates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna listened to the heartbeat of his own touch, counted down the countdown, stepped forward to the evil beast, and placed the explosive pack on its path. On the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it is so pressed, nothing can stop it from moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three interest rates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna turned and ran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two interest rates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yiqi-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only heard a muffled sound, Fanna felt a shock at his feet The world has once again become awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and saw the white rushing out of the carapace - it was the snow that the explosives had when they exploded, at first glance A group of scattered fog flowers. The evil beast finally stopped moving forward, as if it could no longer bear the weight it carried, and the huge armor crashed into the ground. Then the black blood rushed out from under the shell, soaking the surrounding ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"喔喔喔-!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly burst into cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna sat down on the floor until this time, he found that his cold sweat had soaked his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s finally over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone thinks so, the screaming horns rang again on the border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
