			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the second half of the month, there was a strange stalemate on the battlefield of the wolf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil who attacked the four cities early should have erected a new batch of storage towers to prepare for the engulfment of the wolf and the attack on the morning. However, the actual situation is that they were frustrated by the first army's mobile power. Apart from the sinking of the sea, the other three cities have not been able to build a storage tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the attack by the empty knights, the aristocratic people who were responsible for carrying the red fog also swayed, which made the devil have to transfer some of the troops to supervise Control the normal operation of the blood line. Coupled with the forward expansion of the line of defense, the situation of insufficient manpower has become more apparent. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army in the spirit of as long as the gun is earned, and did not insist on attacking the four cities, those who are on the outer perimeter of the defense, the same is Their hunting target. Several steam trucks quickly reached the pre-set position, then put down the fortress guns, hit two rounds where the devils gathered, and then loaded and evacuated. This small-scale battle occurred almost daily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the front and rear of the biplane and artillery units, the devil did not have passive defense. They have organized many attacks, even when the first troops attacked the cage, they also organized a team of human devils in the rear, took the opportunity to destroy the road near the cage mountain, and used black powder in the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time, the north and south aorta has been penetrated, and the cement produced by the Chenxi Kingdom can be transferred to the front line at any time. The simple roads that are blown up are often in the lotus and engineering. The team's synergy will be fixed the next night. Although the low temperature and snow make the solidification time of the cement greatly extended, in the final analysis, it is only the cost-effectiveness problem. The stable sandstone surface is crushed and repaired. After the completion of the aortic engineering, a large number of idle construction teams have gathered. In the Cage Mountain area, the First Army does not lack the manpower in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the continuation of the saw, the devil’s offensive was getting slower and slower, and there was no momentum that was initially pressed across the board. The strikers of both sides solidified for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod raised his head and looked at the essays and stopped slowly, and closed his eyes slowly. "Tell it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; From the other side's look, it can be seen that this will certainly not be good news. However, the recent bad news is too much, and it has not been interested in expressing its anger and disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Totolock personally led the team to attack human beings in the command post of Cage Mountain, and finally heroic battle died on the front line." Iasis first, "... ...it practices his promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It fulfilled its promise but did not fulfill its mission. Heikzod did not react much to this long-anticipated result. It doesn't even want to ask about the specific circumstances of the subordinates' wars. When fighting with the federation, the fall of every high-ranking promoter means that the challenger is not too light, and collecting intelligence is a necessary job. Can fight with today's humans, a little careless will die under those strange firearms, it can fully imagine the last scene encountered under the Ministry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Totolock personally led the team to mean that it was the last combatable force of the Western Army. It is a glory that can be meaningless to the ethnic group. If it wasn’t for the subordinates who were transformed from the Hell Lord, but only good at the charge and not good at manipulating the magic stone, it would be better to be destroyed by human firearms. The parasitic eyebrows may be more useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these words cannot be said in the presence of another subordinate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the current situation is not a problem for Totolock alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you are brave and wise, you will not be able to make a big difference if you don’t have enough troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate attack is itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a king that limits the number of West Lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, Wang has given it enough support, the most hateful is bloody and fake, if the former can draw more corners, if The person can follow the agreement to provide a sufficient amount of symbiosis, and the result should be completely different -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... is it really different? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, a lingering thought emerges in my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people has doubled again, the West Line Army can really occupy the entire wolf heart, but then there are morning and gray castles, how many more talents it will add enough? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone..." The Lord of Heaven could not help but blurt out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult?" Iasis asked inexplicably, "What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Nothing." It shook his head. Yes, Ursuk has given the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Abandon those cities that have mined the stone veins, give most of the land to the Tianhai world, and then put all the troops into the dawn. Not the existing plan Ten times, but all - including existing and new, going on and going until humanity perishes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the one that I value most. The conclusion reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time all Maharajas thought it was just an unrealistic reverie. Now it seems that it has some understanding of Erskuk’s thoughts at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hesitating for a long time, Heckzod made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a deep-eyed monk, and he got up and walked out of Dianchi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The top of the tower of the birth." The Lord of Scorpio said, "I want to apply to the king for a meeting of the Holy See!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; The misty sea under the feet and the tower of the birth of the giant eyes are gradually appearing in front of you - seeing this scene, it is a little relieved. The meeting of the Holy See is generally issued by Wang. This kind of active application has not been repeated, and it will also cause dissatisfaction with other Maharajas. After all, not everyone is willing to enter this area of ​​consciousness where the king controls everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was before, Heckzod also had an instinct to enter the dominion of the Holy See, but it has no better choice now, only through this method, It can tell the king and all the monarchs about their ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Wang did not reject his application. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, the other monarchs appeared on the cantilevered seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s you...Heckzod." Bloody voice, "I don't know what's going on in the West. I really need it." It’s hard to be the next thing to report, is it more important than the nightmare lost in the conscious world?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, Vakiris When you lose your consciousness, you only report to the king separately," the mask then echoed. "Now there is such a thing to hold a meeting of the Holy See. Don't tell everyone that your city of Tianzhu will soon be caught by those bugs. - I managed to pick up a lot of resources and train the symbiosis for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy...and shirking responsibility for himself It is. Heckzod glanced at it coldly and said that it was five times more symbiotic, and the result has only been sent to about half. There is certainly a reason for the strengthening of the Tianhai border offensive, but it is also true that the number of agreements has not been reached. If it is placed before, it will never miss this opportunity to attack each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Hucksold’s interest in a bit of a fight is not raised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough is enough." Wang’s voice was introduced into everyone’s mind. "I think that the Lord of Heaven’s application for the Holy See must have its own reasons. You listen. It’s not too late to post comments.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Additional...” The eyes on the tower of the birth looked at Heikezod together, “The Lost of Nightmare It's not your fault. I also agree to the request to send a silent disaster to help you fight. Therefore, I hope that your report is better not to complain and ask for the cliché, otherwise it will only waste each other's time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
