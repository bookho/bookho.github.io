			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fertile plain, the front of the Tower 9 site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The target is six degrees four points northeast, distance 6500, one side of the area, apply for shelling coverage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Sylvie is on the back of the wheat, overlooking the land not far from the front - many turf on the ground have been smashed, and the scattered soil is still very fresh, probably within the last two or three days. Things that happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" has been recounted." There was a short answer from Sawyer on the side of the hearing, "The shelling began in five minutes." At the end she added In a sentence, "Please pay attention to safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi couldn’t help but look at Tachila, and now at this height, it has been able to capture the Holy City with the naked eye. The location of the ruins. Although there are still more than 50 kilometers, it looks smaller than the nails, but gives her a feeling of being close at hand. The silhouette of the city collapsed with the woods, like a forgotten miniature sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is beyond the scope of the Eye of the Magic, she can still feel a shining red star is flashing. As long as it does not move, it means that they are still in a safe position for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the seal and took a shot The broad back, "We fly a little higher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The singer of the wheat screams, and the giant wings that open nearly ten meters rise up by the wind - now her body size is almost the size of two ordinary beasts, which is called the giant in the beast, even Cabrada is not much more than the variant that is being controlled. However, assume that she became a pigeon and is still a giant in the pigeons, and Hilli felt relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After climbing about a hundred meters, there was a dull thunder behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the earth in front of her suddenly ignited several dust pillars, and the ripples around the pillars were clearly visible. Just like turning a solid land into a rippled water surface. No matter how many times you enjoy it, such a scene is pleasing to the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the second round, the third round of thunder...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artillery battalion The projectile has been able to accurately shoot into the area she has marked - because it is difficult to determine the area of ​​the strike area in the air, it is usually replaced by a rough estimate, and one side is equivalent to the size of the winter castle area, about 16,400 square feet. M, is also one of the places she is most familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of the gunfire, Hilli did not take long to see the stump that flew out with the dust column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 152mm grenade is enough to make a crater as deep as a meter or so, and the devil's latency is no more than fifty centimeters, which is still corroded by red fog. On the land. If it is an ordinary ground, it will just overturn its head. If it happens to be dropped on the head, then even a complete body will not be left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s not that the grenade is exactly hit to kill the devil. The shock wave that blooms in a circle is the real killer, especially for being buried underground. In terms of goals. The body that fits snugly against the soil means there is no cushioning, and the impact within 20 meters of the heart will be fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not pay attention to the specific location of the enemy, but the slap in the face to blow the entire area to play, called the wash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five rounds of artillery, a hundred ambush devils climbed out of the mud and began to flee backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy has appeared, determined to be a madman, please shoot in the original angle." Hillway reports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Received."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, she felt like she was looking up at the tower Chila looked away, the red starburst suddenly brightened a lot, and quickly flew towards the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McMug also reversed the direction and quickly evacuated the airspace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, the three returned to the first army's air defense circle, and the demon had also entered the direct scope of the magic eye. Sylvie saw the blue-skinned devil, who resembled humans, hovering over the area of ​​the shelling area for two laps, then staring at the three people in the air, his expression full of killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, the artillery battalion never stopped shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is angry, but there is nothing to do, Hilli realizes. Even a powerful demon can't stop a roaring shell from killing its kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, it can only drop the fleeing madness and turn and return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilvey suddenly felt a lot less stress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's gone, let's go over the investigation again?" Mai said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glanced at the lightning bolting her fist and finally shook her head. "Come here today, I still need to keep some magic for the night. And The surrounding five or six kilometers have been swept over, enough to ensure the safety of the engineering team in recent days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the underground command post at Site 9, Sylvie painted a piece of land on the map green – that was the area that was cleaned up today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green like this is almost full of railways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Working hard," Xiao Xiaochen took a cup of black tea and came forward. "It seems that the exiled plan of Isis adults has worked."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilvey took the tea and laughed. "Well, it’s true now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like like this The encounter is not the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, since the approaching to Takira for a hundred kilometers, her risk of going out to reconnaissance has increased dramatically - when using the magic eye to penetrate the soil layer It will make it difficult to pay attention to the enemy in the air, and within this distance, the devil has been able to stay in the air for a long time while carrying a gas tank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the staff department has developed an "exile plan", which divides the reconnaissance area into several layers and 0-2 km as an absolute safe area. Every corner has been swept by the magic eye, and then it is always under the warning of the site, and it is unlikely that it will be attacked. Within this distance, the air defense team can leave the trenches and provide a broader protection circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2-10 km is the screening area, which is within the distance of the fortress and is the main active airspace of Sylvie and McMug. After cleaning, it can be considered relatively safe and marked on the map in green. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10-50 km is a dangerous area, only one person is scouting here, the purpose is to find out those enemies hidden in the clouds and give early warning, which is equivalent to McMillan and Hillvi took the time to retreat. Only lightning has the ability to get rid of the enemy's pursuit in this distance. Even if the other party is a demon, it is impossible to catch the witch entering the speed of sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts prove that the exile plan is quite effective, and the reconnaissance team can completely decide when to attack, and the enemy can only passively intercept. Without the ground army to cooperate with the attack, it is difficult for the fearful beast to cause damage to the armored trains at the forefront. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the screening area into a safe zone step by step, pull out the nails set by the devil, and exile the most threatening demon from the battlefield, let It has a strength, but it can't catch the tail of the reconnaissance team. This is the core idea of ​​the plan. If you can make the other party lose their sense of reason and harden the front line of defense, it is even better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only regret is that the Demon have never shown signs of getting out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," Sylvie looked around, "Miss North Pearl... What about her?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Received the command of His Majesty, and took the Seagull to return to the Winter City without the Iron Axe." Fei Lin smiled back. "I think it should have arrived at that time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
