			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a strip of snow covered alleys, listening to the snoring from the soles of the feet, Livya’s chest is getting warmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winter in the north is always a look, the sky is dark and gloomy, like a slate that is pressed against the top of everyone's head; the earth is shrouded in snow, everything has lost its original color. Coupled with the cold and hunger that comes with it, this monotonous scene is hard to be annoying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she saw a color that she had never had before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color is even more embarrassing than the rainbow, even in this snowy season, it is as eye-catching as the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The closer you get to it, the more you can't wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the light is directed at the cottage she rented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not for a livelihood, she doesn’t even want to leave it a step--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that’s her child . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystallization of her and Gordon Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him, she seems to have the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Livya’s footsteps can’t help but be a little faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when she turned into the last alley, her heart was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the snowy ground, there are more than ten footprints. From the perspective of the direction, they walked into the ground from another lane and went straight into the big Hospital entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she stayed in this compound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbors here are ordinary civilians, not to mention the evil moon. Even in the spring and summer, there are very few guests visiting, why are they more plain? So many footprints? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Livya only felt dizzy in her head, and then an unspeakable fear came to my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, calm down...she keeps telling herself that maybe it’s just a bunch of robbers who robbery, or refugees who have flown here – the same for outsiders The bad situation is the last hope for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But trembling at the first sight after entering the compound, even this hope no longer exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the house she rented was full of patrols wearing soft armor, one of whom was dressed as a knight, and the badge on the chest represented him from the rule of the North. The Kant family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No-!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leffia doesn't know where it broke out Drop the milk cake that I bought in my arms and bow down to the gate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, she was ready to be killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not even use the other party to do it, as long as the sword is pulled in front of her, she will hit it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, they seem to be indifferent to her appearance, just slightly open the body, let her straight into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slammed Livia, who was flustered. The cold ground ruined her dress like a disc, but the pain from the knee was negligible. She crawled into the little bedroom with tears and wanted to see the last side of the child, but found that the expected scene did not appear -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The blue-haired woman sat on the bed and teased her child with no expression, and the nanny who usually took care of the child stood respectfully and stood as if the other person was the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the woman looked up and her eyes swept over her - just a glance, let Livya understand that this person and himself are absolutely not Belonging to the same category, although she has an unforgettable look, she has also linked her to common women. Mild, tender, charming, sensual... Those words that belong to women are not suitable for her. Even with her children, there is no motherhood in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time I met," the other slowly said. "My name is Itis Kant. You should have heard my name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northland Pearl - Livya’s heart was shocked. She was the eldest daughter of the Duke of Kant. The rumor that led the Cavaliers to charge the strange woman? The name of the pearl in the north can be described as nobody knows, no one knows, even Goron has mentioned her many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even some people say that she is more difficult to deal with than the Duke himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have seen adults," Livya swallowed, leaned down and touched her head. "I ask you this time, I want to... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis set up his hand, and the nanny next to him immediately took a gift, then left the bedroom and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, she already understood that the nanny she had found was basically arranged by the Kant family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have long discovered the secrets of their children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A long story is short, I was taken by the sire of the King, bringing the blood of the Wimbledon family back to the Winter City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then...save him secretly?" Livya said hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you just want to erase his existence, you can do it anywhere, you don't have to work so hard," Isis untied the wrap of the child's head, revealing that A shallow gray hair, "Your Majesty needs a reason to hide his ears, nothing more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifia couldn’t help but she couldn’t understand her words. In the meaning, "Adult, I... don't quite understand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This matter is not as complicated as you think," Northland Pearl shrugged. "You, have you heard of witches?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the other’s story, It took a long time for Livya to connect the two things together, and the conclusions obtained were even more incredible than the Arabian Nights! Roland Wimbledon is determined to marry a witch, so I plan to pull out the children of Goron to calm the public opinion? She doesn't know much about the nobility's doorway, but she also feels that this method is too unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is a king, is it really necessary to do this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gritted her teeth and braved her courage. "Adult, please forgive me, I can’t believe it. Maybe you have this idea now, but it doesn’t mean you will So, in case of any changes, Xie Luohe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sherlow? Is this child's name?" Itis raised an eyebrow. "You don't seem to understand your situation. Your order is absolute. You only have two choices. Take a fortune and go so far. Don't ask about it, or go with him to the Winter City, but you can't His mother’s appearance appeared, but the servant of a noble family.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levya felt tears in her eyes, yes, her identity was too Too low, it is impossible to be a part of the royal family. "Who will take care of him instead of me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" She jerked her head up and the tears licked into her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty is not so unappealing. If you choose the latter, except for changing your identity, everything else has not changed, you can still stay with him. Watching him grow up. The noble family has been destroyed in the attack of the church, and Goron’s fiancee entrusted the child to you before he died—the above is the whole story.” Itiston paused "In addition, this news has already been announced in other territories. The North is no exception. Just wait two or three days, you can hear the whole content of this news. If he wants to get rid of you, why bother? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northland Pearl means...have to do this, mainly to make her feel at ease? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Livea held her chest and couldn’t help but show the scene of the night. She was looking for a four-prince at the time. He, and the other party did extend a helping hand to her. Although he may have an ulterior motive, if it is not this, she is afraid that she will die in the poison of the tavern owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
