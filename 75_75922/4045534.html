			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later, Evelyn knew her final grade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a comprehensive test volume of one hundred and five, she got a delightful one hundred and thirteen points. According to the usual practice, this is considered to be It is super level play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the book went to the long song area with Roland, the result was Wendi’s sister. She also took a special shot of Evelyn's shoulder and encouraged her with a smile. "The answer is good. Your wife, Tilly, will be very happy to know that, keep it going."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will continue to work hard!" Evelyn nodded hard and turned to find the candle. "How many points did you take?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Ninety-one points, finally passed," Candle said with a smile. "Look at your expression so happy, you must have done a good job?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah!" She couldn't help but raise her mouth. "One hundred and thirteen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really? This score is probably close to Lucia!" The candle fire surprises, "Would you like me to ask for your question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, they must be better," Evelyn waved "I just need to know the results of McMug."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe the next goal can be changed to Lily or Lucia, she thought, her own Ability Bad, but that is born, she has no way to change. In learning this kind of work requires hard work to progress, even if ordinary people can become attractive, she does not want to lose to anyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also wants to be a knowledgeable person like Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After class, Evelyn found McMug, but the other person’s answer made her unable to believe her ears. “Hey – I took the test. One hundred and seventeen minutes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was kneeling in the same place, until McMug left for a long time without returning to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible? Is the book wrong in her grades?" For a time, Evelyn thought he heard his voice and stunned. The eyes, only to find that the words are just heard on the side, the same mysterious month of doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's impossible," Lily glanced at her. "Don't you suspect that others are not good because of your poor test?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am sitting in front of her," the mystery month argued. "When I received the paper, I saw that she had a large blank and painted honey sauce. Yeah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure?" Lily frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Provided by my electromagnetic power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha...that’s a bit of persuasion There is no force," she shrugged, turned and prepared to leave, but was dragged by the mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, all I said is true! Otherwise, let's investigate."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not interested," Lily grinned. "If you feel weird, you will know when you come back and ask for the book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no meaning for exploration. "Mystery is a fear of the world, "Evelyn, let us help you find out the truth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Don't count me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" The candlelight was also rounded up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evelyn hesitated and put his own incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... what do you do if you want to investigate?" The candle touched Evelyn’s head. How many days does it take?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going to steal the papers? I am not so stupid," mystery shook his fingers. "Just use the place where you can find the scrolls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your It means..." The candlelight is shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call on Axia," she laughed smugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evelyn immediately understood the plan of the mystery month, let Axia play back the illusion of the book to the score of the wheat, can really find the answer to the question. "But... the teacher of the book will usually look at the paper in the city hall. Will we not go there very well?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong? No winter Everyone in the city can go in and out of the place, and of course we can go," Mystery said, "It’s not the office of your majesty, and no one is worried about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to remind you," Lily did not move. "The average person can only enter the lobby of the City Hall. The office of the Ministry of Education is on the second floor. Do you think those officials will let us go?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this..." The mystery of the moon is suddenly stuffed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't do it," Evelyn started to retire. She didn't want to trouble everyone. "I have to wait a few more days." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have a way to solve it," Candles touched his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method of candlelight is very simple, that is, pull Nanawa together, press Her statement, anyway, is called Axia, and it doesn't matter if one more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it turns out that this method works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa. Pine’s popularity made Evelyn stunned. When she entered the city hall the next day, she received warm greetings from everyone. No one is stopping. Probably the image of the little angel is too deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, or her aristocrats who personally praised her father. It is quite prestigious in the Bianbu District. One of the pedestrians has entered the Ministry of Education office without any effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no room in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not a meeting, very few teachers will come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are coming in!" The mystery month excited, "Hurry and start back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... is it really good?" Axia said, "This is where officials can come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The official is not unusual, Hummingbird is also the deputy minister of the Ministry of Construction. "Mystery month patted the chest. "Reassure, as long as we don't say it, the book will definitely not mind if we come to her office to sit down."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the truth is that you are lying, I promise to tell the book." Lily snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you say no?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough... I, I am coming to stare You, prevent you from making a big mistake, understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the two people in dispute, Eveline suddenly felt that this decision may be a mistake. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the candlelight convinced Axia that when the illusion appeared in the office, everyone held their breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time for the book to be judged is obvious, it must be the day between the end of the test and the long song, using the quick flash, she quickly found this A scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone squeezed behind the "book". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the time is not too far apart, Axia has been able to maintain the illusion for two quarters of an hour. In a short while, Evelyn saw the papers of McMug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, I am not lying!" Mystery month picked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
