			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echo is sitting at the top of the castle - overlooking the sloping roof of the tower, where you can see the entire town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is carrying lightning to bring her own, and when the sun sets, the little girl will come over and send her down. Now, lightning should already be on the way to the Long Song Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is very good today, the sun shines brightly on the ground, the river in the distance is like a glowing satin, slowly flowing westward, the green leaves and The land mixed with snow is divided into two. Lying in the sun, she felt that her body was surrounded by soft warmth. Unlike the hot sun in the extreme south, the burning light can easily sting the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is also very different, she thinks, the winds of the mainland kingdom are diverse, there is a salty sea breeze in the clear water port, and the king is hot and cold. The humid monsoon, the icy north wind of the desolate mountains, and the current town with a muddy scent. In any case, the wind here is pure and single. In Tiesha City, it is either hot and windless, or it is a storm that is overwhelming. The wind is visible, and the whistling air is filled with stones and gravel, such as the same black behemoth swept over. At this time, you must hide in the house, or any place where you can avoid the limelight. There is only one dead road in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echo gently vomited gas, now think of it, I have been away from Tiesha City for nearly four years. The Aosha clan unfortunately failed in the struggle for rights. After the father surrendered, he was still killed by the enemy. He witnessed all this and she wanted to rush to go with the enemy, but she was hit by a blow from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how many people in the family can survive after four years have passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before being sold as a slave to Bishuigang, she faintly heard that the Aosha clan violated the sacred duel agreement, and the tribes who were cast aside by the Three Gods will be exiled. To the endless cape, you can never return to Tiesha City. But the echo knows that all this is a conspiracy of the Iron Whip Clan. They smeared the black oil flowing on the bottom of the whip. As long as it ignited, even the water could not be extinguished. It was this trick that allowed his brother, the strongest warrior in the clan, to be burned alive during the duel, causing chaos in the formation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the hot yellow sand, the endless cape has only the pillars of fire that never go out and the sea that is more arrogant than the mother of the earth. The sand people going there will soon become white bones, and the end is worse than being a slave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echo awakening as a god--that is, the witch of the mainland kingdom, once thought of revenge, but her ability is useless simulation sound. No matter how to beg the three gods, the gods did not give her the will. After living in Bishui Port for half a year, she even understood that God’s claim of being favored by the Three Gods was only a scam of the Mojin people’s self-deception. Within the jurisdiction of the four kingdoms, the gods are the targets of the church. From that day on, the echo completely cut off the hope of revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the smoke suddenly rises in the distance. She looked at the east bank of the Chishui River, and saw the flames of faint green light passing through the grove. The burning black smoke of the trees and the white mist evaporated by the snow formed a gray smoke column on the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is Anna's green flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When first arrived here, Wendy briefed the sisters on Anna and Nana. At that time, the echo was very envious of Anna's ability. The freely manipulated flame can melt the high temperature of the sword... If you can have such a powerful force in Iron Sands, the Iron Whip Clan can't live alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echo shook his head, and now it’s no longer meaningful to think about it. It’s a lucky thing to live alive than those who are probably already buried in the yellow sand. Since His Royal Highness is willing to take care of himself, all he can do is to work hard to complete the orders of His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cleared her throat and began to sing songs according to the requirements of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a cheerful little song, and the prince only recited it once, and she completely remembered the whole tune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music is no stranger to the echo. When it is taught as a superior slave, the tempting dance and the teasing singer are all she needs. Master the skills. But the song of His Highness is completely different... It is very rhythmic and full of a kind of energy, especially when he asks to simulate the flute to play this piece of music. Every note seems to be beating and forbearing. I don't want to dance with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, it was difficult for her to ensure that the drums did not disturb the rhythm of the flute, and tried to beat the beats with their hands or feet according to the method proposed by His Highness, and gradually merged the two sounds together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days of practice, Echo gradually mastered this method of onomatopoeia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After auditioning a few times, she stood up and decided to add the final string. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the music played, the echo found that the minor tune had changed again - if the happy flute made up its torso, the heated drums gave it Its skeleton, then the last string of seemingly embellished, makes the song have a soul. She stepped on the beat, over and over again, so that the three instruments were completely integrated, the sound was getting higher and higher, and finally I couldn't help but sing -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** *****************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My attack power is higher than you, so I won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put the last card on the table, and the opposite Soloya licked his face and made a low-pitched cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Again," she thought about a moment and then re-closed the cards. "This time let me choose your ten cards."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," the prince coughed. "The time is not early, I still have something to do, go find someone else to play."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making a card group that is generally sufficient, the next step is to copy it. With the template in front of it, Soroya's drawing speed is comparable to that of a printer. Soon, Roland got a few copies of the same Quent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Soroya became his first opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making the rules of the game clear, a card battle will follow. In the battle, he found that the witch's ability to accept is indeed higher than ordinary people. Soroya quickly figured out the skills of the cards. In the next few rounds, although Roland was able to win, he had already used special cards. Now that he saw the other party asking for a draw for himself, he shamefully refused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Soloya took the card into her arms and ran outside the door. Just then, there was a cheerful and pleasant music coming out of the window. She paused and ran back, squatting at the window and looking at the camera. "Is it echo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it seems she is fully skilled." Roland sat in his chair and admired the familiar music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army of Bianyan Town will soon enter the stage of comprehensive exercises, and it will be different from standing on the wall. The comprehensive performance will be carried out in the wild, requiring the team to travel at the same time. Keep the team neat and orderly – this is also the basic link in the queue. In order to make the soldiers consistent, it is necessary to rely on drums or slogans to command everyone's pace. Now that there is a witch who can simulate mixed sounds, he simply learns the English and goes directly to the infantry march. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of simple drums, marching can not only control the speed of the team, but also effectively boost morale and invigorate the military. Of course, in the most famous march of the shooting period, the Grenadier March, Roland only knows his name, but does not remember the complete tunes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s hard to beat him. There is a song that was adapted on the basis of the Grenadier March. It was heard throughout the country during the War of Resistance. And its melody is familiar to almost everyone, and that is the famous "Guerrilla Song". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soloya turned her head and she heard the prince follow the song and sang softly. That is the language she has never heard before, clean and neat, and fit perfectly with the beat of the song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are all sharpshooters,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every bullet destroys an enemy;" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are all flying forces,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if the mountains are high and deep!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the dense woods,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The campsites where comrades are arranged everywhere;" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
