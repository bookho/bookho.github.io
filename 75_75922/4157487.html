			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here... enter the conscious world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence is amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not Heckzod, it is difficult to establish a connection with the ideology alone after leaving the scope of the birth tower, even if it can briefly touch the source of magic It is also impossible to find Wakiri in the undercurrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why does the Nightmare Monarch deliver this message? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looked around, the entire top of the slope was quiet, and the eyebrows did not issue any warnings. Even the only soldiers standing in front of it were empty, and even the firearms they were proud of were not carried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So...try it a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it can’t be successful, it’s not too late to talk to Hecksod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it, the silence is slowly closing your eyes, trying to sense the extremely fine fluctuations - at this moment, an extremely powerful Power wrapped it! It was surprised to break free, but it was powerless. It was like a quagmire, and the two barriers that were difficult to walk became foamy and light, and it was almost effortless. It connected to the consciousness circle! Even with your eyes closed, it can feel the raging magic around you -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an experience that silence has never had before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are meditation on the side of the birth tower, there will be no such effect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of his heart even gave birth to the illusion that he was welcoming a new promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All feelings are just moments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too late to generate more ideas, and everything has been declared calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that’s not really calm – silence feels a slight snoring in front of you, accompanied by a warm warmth. The wind is very dry, and it is calm and stable, with almost no change in size. It can't find any kind of corresponding scene in its own memories for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent slowly opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It found that he was in a small house, and the house was poorly lit, but not dim. The huge glowing magic stone on the top of the head is emitting bright white light, and every corner of the house shines brightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a weird thing on the wall that emits sound and warmth – it’s neither wood nor metal, the material seems to be between the two The texture of the strip at the tuyere is surprisingly delicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is...the conscious world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have you never seen these things before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it the person who is looking for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the scene, a strange voice sounded . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-handled sword that slammed into the silence, and turned around -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well, I haven't seen you for a long time, Cerroshhi."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a long-awaited reunion. In Dianchi, it sees each other every day, but at this moment, it really understands the difference between the two. The slightly raised mouth, vivid eyes, and familiar sounds... Every detail has an indescribable wave in its mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wakirith adults..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a nostalgic "The nightmare smiled slightly. "But now that you are a Maharaja, at the same level as me, you don't have to use the honor of the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think like it?" Wajilis asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The silent hand was on the hilt, but it was difficult to pull it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, the two not only appear together, but the attitude of seeing each other is not like hostility. Is it... is he the person who is persuaded by the nightmare? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the world of dreams. Let me introduce you briefly. I am the king of the Grey Fort and the leader of the Witch Alliance, Roland Wimbledon." The other side is a handkerchief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you speak the language of my family?" Silence did not dare to set the channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to hear?" Roland repeated the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time it was only a surprise that it was neither a language common to the human kingdom nor a language of ethnicity, but an extremely quirky discourse. But you can understand the meaning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, no matter what language the three speak, they can understand each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can think of it as a communication of consciousness, in short...this is all the details." Roland made a gesture, "To be honest, I want to make this happen." It is not easy to meet, so we should try our best to use time and focus on the problems that need to be solved. Let us sit down and eat and talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp While eating... talking? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stupid, don’t he know that eating and drinking is absolutely unnecessary for high-ranking promoters? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris must have endured him for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the silence saw that the monk was happy to sit at the table and pick up the delicate porcelain cup in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sat down a bit in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Despite the time constraints, if there isn't even the most basic trust, nothing can be said next." Roland went straight to the point, "and for a short time." It is not easy to make you believe that I am afraid, so Wakiris will be responsible for answering your questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So best, "Wakiris looked at Roland with a deep look. "I also have a lot of questions that I want to ask about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then how the nightmare will enter The dreams, as well as what I saw and heard here, were briefly described on one side, and there was no mention of the Western Front war. Silence finally knows the general experience of its lost consciousness, but that is just to know it - because everything is too ridiculous, it is really difficult to understand, human males who have no magic at all, why are they also favored by the ideology . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So... is this the origin of the new heritage of mankind?" Silence opened the door with difficulty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can understand this." Roland replied, "But I prefer to treat it as a complete world. One, like us, is facing the threat of gods, The world at stake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not want to believe in any human being, but there are things that can't help it not believe, such as this area of ​​consciousness that has become a dream. Looking out from the window, you will find it amazingly large, but you can't see it at the end. Let's not say whether the gods really want to destroy this place. From the perspective of its scope, it is far above the king's ruler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also furnishings and utensils that don’t make a name—they all have a consistent character, and that’s incredibly subtle. The ability to spend a lot of energy on this kind of living goods shows how amazing the power of the bottom layer is. If human beings use this power, the great changes in the third battle of divineness are not surprising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the most important thing is Vakiris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its vision and ideas are far better than themselves. If there is no objection on the spot, it is full of persuasiveness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
