			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Army completed the follow-up replenishment work and will soon start again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the second half of the spring offensive - to win the Liuye Town and the Dragon Ridge. The former will bring the entire Western environment into one, while the latter is the most convenient way to the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that the two towns are not easy to defend and difficult to attack, Roland gave the command to the iron axe, and he no longer went with the team. Due to the recent attack on the king, the morale of the army is extremely high, and the professional soldiers have gradually emerged as the prototype of the modern army. They can faithfully execute the combat orders without the leader personally leading them, so Roland has no worries about the outcome of the battle. As long as the investigation work is done well and the artillery units are steadily advanced, the enemy will not be able to turn any waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reconstruction of the post-war order is the focus of his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good in Liuye Town, the scale is not large, there is no need to set up a full-featured lower-level city hall like Changge District, just arrange the corresponding department office. Now that Bianbu District has been able to provide a group of basic management personnel, it is not difficult to integrate Liuye Town into the political system without winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Longling Ridge, it will be handed over to the Earl of Speer for management. After the fall of Tiffco, she has sworn allegiance to Roland and agreed to accept it. The management model of the West. In order to help her take over the city and clean up the rebellious nobility, it is necessary to send the first army to station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, in the future, whether it is further annexation of the Southland or the capture of Tieshan City, the Longling Ridge is a key traffic artery, so another purpose of the garrison is to prevent it. accident. In any case, the city must be in control of Roland’s hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this way, the number of the first army can be tight," after setting the plan, the iron axe frowned. "The king currently has five hundred People, Liuye Town and Panglongling also need to occupy a thousand people. The only troops we can freely mobilize are less than 1,500. Most of them are artillery. Without Winter City, I am afraid that I will temporarily lose my initiative. Ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the recruit training for the expansion of the evil month?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The level of the regular troops is still far away," he shook his head. "It will take at least two or three months to train."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland laughs and laughs, wants to be at the beginning When the militia was formed to resist the evil beast, it only took a month and a half to train the scalp on the wall. Now the army is building more and more comprehensive, and even the qualification standards have increased a lot. In fact, it is possible to hear the instructions marching in line and align the triggers with the target. In this era, even if it is a strong army - after all, the queues need to be pushed against the opponent's firepower, and here is just aiming at the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, the troops stationed at that time can be replaced with these recruits, so that they can play with the aristocratic guards." Roland said easily, "wait until the recruitment The return of the refugees’ ambassadors will bring us a new population peak, and then we will continue to expand the size of the army.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not the end. The capture of the Dragon Ridge is only the beginning. If all goes well, he hopes that the entire polar South can be included in the territory before the evil moon arrives this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can get a stable supply of black water resources, he may be able to push the industrial level of no winter city to a new level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after the iron axe retired, the nightingale appeared silently in front of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ife wants to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at the bloody witch who walked into the office slowly, Roland felt some changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pace is not as steady as it was when she first arrived, and her black hair is slightly messy, apparently not taking care of it. The vigilance and proud look of the face faded a bit, replaced by a sense of chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, she is more like a girl who is in line with this age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yi Fei first took a ritual, and after a long silence, he opened his mouth. "Your Majesty, what is the weapon used by McMug?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
