			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are water wells and water intake facilities around the castle, the fire broke out very fiercely, and the smoke rushed down the corridor, making it difficult for rescuers to even have a hall. near. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Army quickly withdrew from the castle and blocked the area. The fire burned for almost two hours until the next afternoon. There is nothing left in the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the scene was the cleanup and investigation, the officers who came with the army set up a temporary town hall and began to take over the administrative affairs of Jinsuicheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire in the dungeon quickly came to fruition: a group of mice sneaked into the castle underground from the secret passage because of the hatred of the Duke of Borg, who turned the bustling city into a poverty-stricken fortress. Piled up the wheat straw in the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is a very vicious artificial arson case, not only a major threat to the East Order, but also a provocation against the No. 1 Winter Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to vigorously publicizing the results of the investigation, the First Army and the City Hall also launched a campaign to clear the mouse in the city. Frankly wide, resisting strictness, reporting rewards, exposing foods... Together with the stocks found in various aristocratic houses, they are gradually put into the market and relief, and the dead city suddenly becomes noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night of the release of the rodent command, the bear's paw once again got into the camp of the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Boss, those big families have signs of evacuation. Today Xichengmen passed more than a dozen carriages, looking at the direction to Haifeng County. How many of them? The rut is particularly deep, I think the above should be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gold and silver jewelry," the iron axe put down the quill in his hand, "but one At the beginning, I said that as long as the food, they let them go with other things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general commander was not surprised by the occurrence of this situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fire broke out, the trust between the First Army and the traditional nobility was completely disintegrated. Regardless of the consideration, it was the only thing they could think of. The way to live. Losing the family's pillars and several knights is not an unbearable loss for a family. The title can be inherited, and the knight can be enshrined again, but the courage of confrontation will not happen again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of staying here and waiting to die, it is better to take a young, a servant, and a wealthy family to go to it to find new opportunities - the closure of the land is important, But the latter is more reluctant than the life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, in order to prepare for this war, Willie Borg concentrated all resources in Jinsuicheng, and most of the nearby territories were seriously ruined. It is very difficult to recover in three years, otherwise they will not make up their minds so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, there is one more thing..." The bear's paw said half of the words and ends, for a nucleus adjutant, this is a rare expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said," the iron axe is the color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fire in the dungeon... Did you put it?" The bear paw hesitated for a while, and finally whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you say this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, don't mention the iron gate in the dark passage. The partition, the strength of a few mice alone is difficult to break through. I feel that the team that was stationed did not relax until some people set fire to it. I also went to the dungeon and saw that the flame did not seem to be drawn from the room. The aisle spread to both sides, and according to the wreckage after burning, it should be caused by oil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe nodded after listening, "You guessed That's right, it's my order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably I didn't expect him to be so refreshed, the bear's paw couldn't help but squat for a while, "...why? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of thing can be done by me. You know it is easy to make a dice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I didn't ask this," the adjutant shook his head. "I mean - are they not surrendering?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
