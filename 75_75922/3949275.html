			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight Charger does not mention the speed to the highest in the first place. The horse has limited physical strength and can only maintain high speed in a short time. Normally, they will let the horses trotting from one to eight hundred meters, gradually accelerating to five hundred meters, and finally entering the two hundred meters before starting to sprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a 12-pound Napoleon cannon fires a solid projectile, the theoretical effective range is up to 1,300 meters. Perhaps because of the short diameter, Roland's artillery could not be seen outside of the kilometer, so he had to fire within 800 meters during the training. At this point, the gun's head is guaranteed, and the shell will still bounce forward after landing, causing line damage, and the possibility of hitting against multiple targets is still high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Ryan ordered the knight to stand up and ordered the knight to stand by in the acceleration zone - this is an absolutely safe area, bow and bow Neither can threaten the knight, and the latter has sufficient distance to increase the speed of the horse. The low efficiency of the mercenary has allowed the knights who have already been in place to stop the mount and stand still. For the artillery group, they almost became fixed targets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke did not know that when his troops entered the land, they had already fallen into Roland’s pre-set battlefield. The road in the middle is flat and spacious, and the plants on both sides are filled with leaf-catalyzed plants, which look like ordinary grass. Under the deep weeds of the knees, they cover the thick vines, just like a horse. If the cavalry wants to cover the side of the line of defense, it can only advance at a very low speed. Within a kilometer range, Soroya has marked the distance, and the ground may not be clear, but in the lightning eye that overlooks the whole world, the battlefield is accurately divided into several segments, and the different color marks represent different distances - the enemy Just like advancing on a ruler, the artillery team does not need to calculate the shot angle of the muzzle. It is only implemented according to the predetermined steps in the exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12-pound gun of the Fanner Group was the first to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large amount of gas generated by the detonation of gunpowder pushes the projectile out, and when it flies out of the cornice, it has accelerated to more than 400 meters per second, almost two rounds. Between the breaths, the shells slammed on the ground with a whistling sound, passing through the two knights and falling into the grass beside the road. The splashed earth and gravel caused the horse to run away, and one of them had no time to react and accidentally fell from the horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two rounds of the shells that followed were also shot, bringing a series of dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first shot of the four-door artillery was only the last group to become a lucky one - this iron ball is unmanned in front of the air, a knight is controlling the frightened mount It happened to pass through the front of it, the armor was invisible in front of the huge kinetic energy. The iron ball pierced the thin iron sheet together with the flesh and blood, and after a small bounce on the ground, it broke the calf of a knight. The horses under his knees were also opened and the internal organs flowed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Knights are in the normal acceleration phase, the next round of shelling should first adjust the angle of the shot, but this sudden blow clearly shocked the Dukes, they did not even know The way the strike comes from, the way it is used – the speed of the projectile exceeds the ability to identify with the naked eye. The Cavaliers did not receive an attack command and were still in the same place, trying to calm down the restless mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fanner Group completed the reloading process as quickly as possible, and the second round of shelling began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flesh and blood body exposes its fragility and softness under the hot weapon, and once it is passed by the iron ball, it is an irreparable serious injury. In addition to being broken into several limbs, the knight who was directly hit also had a bloody spray that splashed. Only after the second ejection of the shells, people can faintly see a vague black ghost, plundering the lives of their companions in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two rounds of artillery hit, the Duke finally linked the fire, roar and inexplicable blows in the enemy camp. The opponent seems to have an incredible weapon, and its range is far more than the bow, almost equal to the trebuchet of the fortress. With this in mind, the Duke ordered his hand to blew the horn of the attack - as long as the distance is approached, this long-range strike weapon will basically lose its effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Cavaliers showed a very different reaction. Some people began to accelerate in the direction of the town after hearing the number. Some people were still competing with the mount, while a small number of people had retreated toward the rear. Together with the mercenaries, the whole scene was chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attacking knights returned to the main road, and the guns were busy. In addition to cleaning the cannons and loading ammunition, they also needed to move the gun mount again. At this time, the lightning returned to the line of defense again, and the ribbon in the hand was replaced with red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
