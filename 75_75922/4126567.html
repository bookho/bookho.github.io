			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day after the official throne, Roland held the third plenary session in the castle parlour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main content of the meeting is the issue of power distribution that most officials are most concerned about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the right standing supporters, this is undoubtedly their long-awaited moment – ​​the concept of working for the local lord and working for the king is a very different concept. In particular, most people have worked in the City Hall and have a basic understanding of the new king's concept of "weakening the locality and strengthening the central government". This promotion is even more important. This means that they will leap from the former nameless generation to the central official of the Grey Fort Kingdom, and the management will no longer be a western place. Its influence can be said to be stronger than the great aristocracy in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland naturally will not let this "one step into the sky" mood continue to expand in his ranks of officials, so the general rules at the beginning of the meeting In front, "First of all, I am here to congratulate everyone - can be invited to participate in this meeting, will be part of the upper elite of the gray castle. In the next few decades, you will join me in co-governance "This kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say it is heavy, sire." Barov took the lead and stood up, leaning his chest and bending, "I can work for you, it is us." I am honored! If you have anything, please do not hesitate to do so!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the words of humility, the boss’s face is already laughing I have to pile up the pleats, and I am obviously looking forward to the road ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smiled and nodded, indicating that everyone sat down and said slowly, "But there is one point I have to say in front, to recover the right of the nobility. It is to let the incumbent replace it; and to maintain the prosperity of a kingdom depends on how many outstanding talents are fighting for it, so I don't want to see you become another aristocrat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is of course..." Barov quickly said, "No one can guarantee that the descendants have the same talents, and all positions should be preferred."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words immediately caused a chorus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s an illusion. Roland always felt that the officials of the city hall had changed a lot before, and even the flattering was smoother and he looked at him. There is also an awe of unclear eyes in his eyes - this difference makes him faintly pleasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably also the role of the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that for this seat, Tiefco and Garcia will not hesitate to drag more than half of the kingdom into the flames of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Roland didn’t let himself immerse himself in this mood for too long, even the supreme king’s rule is just a corner of the vast continent. If you are only satisfied with this, what is the difference between some island chiefs who have never heard of a name? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is so big, he wants to check it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you said is only the most basic point," Roland looked around the hall. "In fact, no one can guarantee that the capable person will always be competent for him." Position! The temptation of the outside world, the solidification of thoughts, and the desire to inflate may ruin a person's way forward! You are no exception."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With As he raised his volume, the ministers bowed their heads and did not dare to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So entering the hub is only the beginning. Your ability and achievements will be assessed annually, and then it will be promoted or in place. It is up to it. Rolandton paused. "Of course, there will be even worse results - for example, those who know what can't be done but still cause losses to the kingdom will be cut off and sent to the courtroom for disposal!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty..." Barov cautiously asked, "Who don't know this assessment, who will write it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I am responsible," Roland looked at him. "Are there any questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the real investigator is the night of the Security Bureau, But it is more appropriate to perform on his face in his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
