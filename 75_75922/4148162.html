			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To welcome our new members, toast!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening, the space in front of the Witch building A long table was set on the floor, and a lively welcome party was held. Wendy and the book took the lead to pick up the glass and lifted it to the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheers!" The rest of the witches should be in harmony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dailan and Momo hold the cup and look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not expect that she promised to join the league, immediately was dragged by Wendy to wash a very comfortable hot bath, and then put on a new set of clothing Even underwear and footwear are included. Before she returned from the gratitude and guilty conscience, she was brought to the front of the building again, but this time, the lawn has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time just shouting a toast, and then drinking a drink from the glass." Luo Jia demonstrated, "Like me like this - 咕噜咕噜咕噜——”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Dry...cheers...” Dailan plucked up her courage to imitate the road, then closed her eyes and put the cup to her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonne-tonne-ton--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a whistle and applause in the crowd . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luo Jia is making a drink in the monks," Lily grinned. "Who said that after a dry cup, I must have a drink, I think she just wants to drink." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that is the strawberry white bar brewed by Evelyn, which is comparable to the wolf girl. I am a little girl." The moon lingers, "This kind of talent must join our detectives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So your group will be slackers and drunks in the future, indeed It matches you very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still you in the group!" Mystery month tilted the index finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I-no! And you still owe me a ten-yuan volume!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hey, forget it, we can start over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "嗝儿-" After Dai Lan finished drinking a whole cup of wine, she felt that her eyes were a little fluttering. She was forced to accompany her to drink a variety of wines, but none of them was as hot as the ones drinking today. When the wine enters the throat, it is not bitter. Instead, it has a rich mellow flavor. Until it enters the stomach, it can feel that it is far more than the ale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the biggest difference is not the drink, but her mood at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When watching the wolf woman fight to add a second glass of wine to the cup, watching the warm smile of the surrounding witch, Dai Lan felt for the first time, drinking the original Not a painful thing. It makes you want to feel empathy with everyone, and let the emotions that have been suppressed for a long time begin to loosen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, another tall woman walked up to her with a wine glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the Winter City, my name is Annie, and I am from the wolf heart like you, even the experience of finding a bloody tooth will be like you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dai Lan stunned, "Don't you be a bloody tooth..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Wrong, but I escaped halfway. In addition, there are not many witches who fled from the wolf heart to the gray fort, such as this one..." The other side was pulled from behind by a witch who seemed to be tweaked, "Ife, she Even a member of the bloody meeting. It was just that Herti Morgan was selling witches. She didn't know it at the time. Fortunately, everything is over now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After a long time, Dai Lan had a general understanding of the establishment of the bloody tooth conference. It was originally forced to flow to the gray fort because of Herti Morgan's own desires, far more than her and Momo. And this nightmare-like organization disappeared two years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she heard this, she couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," Effie bowed. "If I could stop Herti at the time, these things might not happen..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not yours. Wrong," Momo shook his head. "And... even if you can stop her, you can't stop those nobles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Indeed, the first is not a witch In fact, it doesn't matter. No Het would have someone else to reach a new deal with them.” Dylan knew the desires of those people, and they would never let go if they tasted the sweetness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You see, I said they won't blame you?" Annie laughed. "Since there is no winter city, there are any difficulties in the future. We are negotiating. Even the confused people like Effie can live, I believe you must be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respect for the past." The wine glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cheers." This time, Dai Lan said it was much smoother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next time it’s my turn!" Luo Jia said with a blush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And me!" Lightning also joined in. "I am an adult, I can drink!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“咕咕咕!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You can’t, pigeons can’t drink.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "咕!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't just drink and eat something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Nana, you are not yet a grown-up, don't make trouble with them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere on the lawn is getting hotter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The league hasn't joined new people for a long time, and now suddenly two more. It seems that everyone is very happy." The long table, the book can not help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the right thing to take them to visit the Witch Building first. I gradually realized the means of your Majesty." Wendy laughed. "Even if they are sleeping first The curse touched, and I was sure to pull the two together. According to His Majesty, this is called the icing...what is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also do it It’s getting more and more different,” the book joked. “At first, I obviously felt that I was not capable enough. Now I am ready to play the idea of ​​His Highness.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I'm just making an analogy. It's like you've gotten started quickly since the time of the co-help period." Wendy poured a chaotic drink for her. "But the words come, so the lively scene is still It’s really boring.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately we can only look at it." The book shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing wrong with it, if you can, I hope to keep watching them all the time." Wendy whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book did not pick up the words, the two silenced, while watching the crowds, while enjoying the delicious dinner. For them, this is not a speech, but a tacit understanding of long-term relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a familiar voice is inserted, "When the banquet is over, you want to meet the witch named Momo."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the nightingale gradually emerged from the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty quickly realized Roland’s thoughts, and the original relaxed expression was slightly condensed, “This...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take her," the book said. "From the moment you reported your ability, this will happen. After all, the curiosity of your Majesty is stronger than anyone else."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty was silent for a moment, "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you don't want to know the answer, go ahead It’s okay to retire, I think you will understand it.” The book was paused. “But whatever the answer is, we will always be, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
