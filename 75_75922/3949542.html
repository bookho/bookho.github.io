			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was shocked by this phrase "not much time". After asking clearly, he was relieved a little. "If you don't say half, you can stop it." "It’s strange to infiltrate people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think that five years is very long?" Ai Gesha frowned. "This law is in the first and second." The second war of the gods is accurate, but now I don't know why it has been shortened, and... it may become shorter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you It will be said that the Red Moon will come this winter," Roland shrugged. According to the current research and development progress, in a year, he will be able to spread the new firearms to the whole army. As long as the enemy is not invulnerable, this war is not without a chance. The only thing to note is that the construction of the territory must be developed to a level sufficient to sustain a protracted war. This requires that the land, population, and resources meet a high standard and have sufficient strategic depth to allow for operational defeat. Temporarily retreat to save a living force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the difficulty lies not in weapons, but in the construction of two or three industrial cities to provide population, arms and food for the war. The logistics guarantee was victorious, and the personnel ensured the logistics. When they integrated, he found that the most lacking was the reliable leadership team, who was in charge of the cadres and clerk. Without these, even if the gray castle is unified, it cannot be integrated into a complete war machine. Maybe those nobles will drag their own legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countries that can be beaten are all countries with a high degree of education. This is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this weapon called?" Ai Gesha suddenly changed the subject. "I remember when you called it a 152 mm fortress..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fortress is a standard artillery," Roland added. "There will be a naval gun version in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can fill the entire wall with such weapons before the Red Moon, we might be able to withstand the devil's offense. Listen to the words of Camo Spoel, the ones I did in the chemistry lab, Are they all part of the artillery?” Aegusa made up his mind, “I will do my best to produce liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen for you, as long as you can—”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure," he comforted. "We will defeat the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*********** ********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there so much to do today?" Evelyn reached out and tapped the bottle of wine and licked her tongue. On the top, the spicy taste seems to be a little stronger. According to the requirements of His Royal Highness, the purer the better the liquor, the best wine can even contain no water, and each drop is pure and mellow – although she feels that the brewed white wine is getting closer to His Royal Highness, it can be compared with “delicious”. The word is getting farther and farther away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, hard work," the manager of the winery put the number on the tank and nodded to her. "Please say hello to my high court." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These...can you really sell it?" Evelyn wondered that with the experience she had run in a pub, I’m afraid few people could Accept such a spicy taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, I don't know," the other smiled. "But every once in a while, someone will come and pick up a batch, so I think it should still be Some people like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evelyn’s heart is loose, if no one wants to drink this, not only is the failure of His Royal Highness, but even he will lose value... ... Fortunately, not what she thought, it seems that His Highness is not a big aristocrat, but he can really grasp the taste of the nobility. She smiled. "Then I am leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the winery, Evelyn goes back to the castle through the cold windy streets, the warm air suddenly Surrounded her. Inside and outside the house is like two worlds. She took a deep breath and took off her coat to make the warmth closer to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of comfortable life has never been imagined before. In the winter, if you are not cramming with your family at the brazier, you can shrink it in the quilt. What is the difference between this scene in the castle and the god country that the church claims to be like the spring season? And the Highness also said that the heating system should be popularized in ordinary residential areas, so that the people can stay away from the cold of the demon moon. She did not know that several church believers had arrived in the Kingdom of God, but here, the witches who claim to be the devil's minions and ordinary civilians have experienced this step by step. If they are known by the group of believers, I am afraid that they will be envious of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
