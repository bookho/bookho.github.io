			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a black-gray smoke at both ends of the city, and the two loud noises made the floor of the tower slightly tremble. After the roar, there was a cheer under the wall. Obviously, it was a big improvement for morale before the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Willie knows that the first round of shooting is nothing more than that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, after the interest rate, two clouds of mud were created in the field, not only did not have an enemy in the middle of the battle, but also the preset points in the previous drills. The deviation is not small. After the projectile landed, it bounced up, rolled forward a small distance, and plowed a shallow trench of three feet in the muddy battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is not a windless day, which means that the Guns need more test shots to hit the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very clear that the cannons that Jin Suicheng spent heavily invested in and the long-barrels used by Roland are far apart, even more than the gap between the muskets. Bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most obvious point is that the stone cannon is not free to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the explosion of the gun body, the craftsmen almost melted all the bronze vessels in the city, and even the ancient clock on the bell tower was not let go. The finished product produced by many experiments is enough to crush any carriage. The wall is only one arm thick and can only be placed on a specially built turret. The pitch angle and orientation are controlled by noose. It takes at least one quarter of an hour to fill each shot. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the spherical projectiles it fired were made of granite and could not be as violently exploded as Roland bombarded the king. Willie also tried hollow shells that could wrap snow powder, but it was extremely unstable to use, and the output was very low due to the iron casing - he never thought about it, where did Roland get it? More raw materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the beginning, the Duke’s defensive strategy was to limit the opponent’s artillery as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the enemy is forced to approach the city, then his boulder can always hit the opponent's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a round of shooting, Roland’s army unexpectedly stopped moving forward, seemingly shocked by this unexpected attack, and began to retreat backwards, away from the shells. It stopped when it was nearly a hundred steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they doing?" Greena asked puzzledly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willien raised the gazebo and noticed that the hundred-hundred man had already removed the utensils on his body and dug up the soil in situ - at first glance They seem to be planning to clear a flat land in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably afraid, want to adjust the team, fight a long-term battle," a visor who was watching the battle on the tower, said, "I heard Roland Wimbledon completely abandoned the Cavaliers. The army was full of a group of villagers who had little knowledge. Before relying on high-quality firearms to win all the way, they basically did not encounter any setbacks. Now we need to attack our walls with our offense. It’s also quite hesitant. It’s beautiful to be muddy, and adults.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But our income and envy are much less, Another person frowned. "This year, the evil moon has escaped many people. Half of the workshops have been abandoned. If you can, it is better to talk to Roland Wimbledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no equivalent condition, and the basis of the peace talks, how to win the next one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mouth," Willie is not pleased. "I will never surrender to the king of the king. If you would rather abandon the identity of the nobility, you must Ti Feike Your Majesty, I will put you into the cellar, and a pile of riot person companion "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; the scene suddenly lost his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparation for this defensive war, Jin Suicheng did pay a lot of money, not only from the business center to a fortress, he also made some The unwillingness to do it at first. But in the eyes of the Duke, it’s all worth it. If the four princes started to control the gray castle from the beginning, then he should have failed, but the other side chose a path of great rebellion, which is to try to overthrow the entire aristocratic system and put all power into his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he can defeat Roland’s offense here, others will change their previous mentality and support him to continue to take the lead, and the gray fort will also emerge. More opponents - it can be said that he is fighting for the fight against Roland and defending the traditional aristocratic system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
