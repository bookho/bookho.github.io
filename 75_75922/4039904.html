			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland slammed the door shut and took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow sticking to him quickly melted into water drops. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; While early on that dream of impermanence, but this scene still made him feel shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland walked to the window of the utility room, the probe looked out, the outer wall was flat, and the shadow of the door was completely invisible. Mark of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, while the apartment building was "built", the door was also embedded in the wall, rather than later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So... Is it only the 0825 room that has such an iron gate, or is it true for every household? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If other rooms also have doors that lead to different spaces, what are the scenes they present? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea made Roland feel excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returns to the bedroom, finds a set of winter clothes from the closet, and the dry down jacket knows that the hair loss is serious, and the wool scarf is more Fork, but he has no better choice at this time. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After putting these warm clothing on in the summer, Rolandton felt that he was surrounded by the stove, the sweat continued to flow, and the temperature in the body rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before coming to the iron gate again, he kicked off the flip-flops, put on a pair of green leather overshoes, and pushed directly into the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;凛冽 The cold wind suddenly poured into his body along the collar and cuffs, plus the sweat before, feels sour. Under the hot and cold, he could not help but sneeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, if the door is kept open, doesn't the home have an air conditioner that does not consume electricity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what it would be like to see this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland licked his nose and looked back - the opening of the door seemed to be connected to a basement half buried in the slopes. There are quite a few such low-rise warehouses, apparently built by farmers or businessmen living outside the city, usually used to store food, ale or other sundries. However, there was no one seen in the surrounding area. This camp was as abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene that surprised him was hundreds of meters behind the slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear boundary in the world at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the field of vision, the slopes covered with snow are cut off by the waist, and the broken rocks float in the air, as if they have lost gravity, and farther is frantic. The whirlwind and the darkness of the margins, occasionally a red lightning flashes across the border area, but even so, the darkness is not deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene, though horrible, is extremely magnificent, and if it is to be described, it is like an island floating in the void. The border continues along the mountains until it disappears into the snow. There is no doubt that there must be such a border at the end of the holy city, but it is too far away, and he can’t see it for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the memory fragment of the remaining radix? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not dare to go to the border to see what happened, whether it was the violent wind that rips the gravel or the lightning that cut through the sky, revealing a dangerous atmosphere. He did not immediately go to the Holy City. From then on, he would have to wait at least half an hour to reach the city. If he walked in the snow without his ankles, he would only be slower. He should be prepared to do more. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; camp on the outskirts of Hou Luolan this will stroll over and over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is the basement, the dwellings or the tents, there is no life in the entire camp, and all the residents are like disappearing. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; This scene has some soul like a battlefield, just as the memory fills the stage background. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no trace of life activities, there is a lot of things in the storeroom, and it is like the moment when the memory is stripped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the grapes in the hands of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was found in a small basement next door. The iron lock on the door couldn’t stop him. He went back to the house and found the wrench. Just unscrew the door bolts together. There are many foods in it, marinated dried meat, fish fillets, wheat... and small half-box grapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks very fresh, it should be shipped from the old holy city below the plateau, take one into the mouth, and feel it cool Sweetness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest gain comes from finding a small iron box from the basement of the basement - not that he observed it carefully, but hidden inside the wall The dark grid itself is open, and even a burning oil lamp is placed on the side, as if someone just disappeared without a trace when it was deposited, leaving only the grid that has not yet come and closed and the iron that is half exposed. box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ten golden dragons and a few jewels in the box. At first glance, they know that the quality is good, and Roland does not hesitate to put them into their own Pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that something in the memory can be brought into the apartment, he is busy immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snow for nearly two hours, Roland moved valuable things into the house a little bit, including a lot of food and a small amount of ordnance, such as Iron armor, short sword and scorn, the former can save food expenses, the latter may be able to hang online to sell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the stuffing room was full, he reluctantly locked the iron door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smashing feeling is simply fantastic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of the entire holy city for him to search, he could not help but want to laugh out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to mention the cost of living, and getting rich overnight is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland panted and took off his clothes, and when he was about to drink his mouth, a strong vertigo suddenly came to his mind,<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? He stumbled two steps. Before he reached the coffee table, he felt his vision reversed. Then there was a bang, and it was dark and shrouded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I woke up again, Roland found himself lying on the bedroom bed, squatting It’s sore, it’s like going through a marathon run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city outside the blinds has been covered by the night, apparently he has been sleeping for more than an hour or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the spirit is too tired, plus the heatstroke caused by the alternating stimulation of cold and heat, he thought to himself, it should be a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what surprised him was that the body didn’t feel much weak at the moment, except for the soreness, but it was full of energy, as if there was a stream of heat circulating in the body. Wherever you go, the touch is very sharp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Roland felt the little breath from the pillow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head slightly and saw the radish lying next to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a wet towel in her hand, half of her cheeks were illuminated by the moonlight, and the thin eyelashes shivered slightly, and the back of the spine slowly and undulating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the room is too hot, her dress has been soaked in sweat, her arms are covered with fine sweat, and a unique sweat is emitted. Sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that Xiaotoutou dragged him from the living room into the bedroom, and also did the basic cooling treatment. He licked his mouth and there was still a residue in his mouth. Musk is the smell of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did she pour the potion in? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
