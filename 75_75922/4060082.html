			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As expected, as Gesha expected, in the afternoon, it was rare to hear the screaming of Mai Xiao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the witch is in combat, the spirit is often in a state of high tension, which is a double consumption for magic and physical strength. Therefore, in the combat training of the Federation, how to take the time to relax the spirit and restore physical strength are the most crucial contents. After all, in the face of the swarm of the devil, only relying on reasonable rotation and teamwork can survive on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Felice drives away and seduce the evil beast, Ai Gesha will sit on the side and take a break until several evil beasts gather together... noon It was also treated with white snow and dry food, and it did not stop for almost a moment. Whenever the ice is sealed for three or four, Aegusa will solidify the snow into a smooth ice, and quickly send the prey to the west wall by sliding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gray sky gradually darkening, the leaves sent them a notice of the end of the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the starting point, the two were surprised to find that there were hundreds of evil beasts in the wooden cages, of which there were thirty backing. The largest hybrid of a wolf bear has almost the height of the wall, and the limbs are as thick as a stone pillar. Even the gods and the beasts are hard to bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which group is this captured? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no change on the surface of Felice, but there is a little loss in my heart. After all, the two have done their best - 22 small and medium The performance of the evil beast was thought to be outstanding enough, but now it seems likely to be the lowest score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is, how did the other two groups catch so many evil beasts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Working hard," Wendy walked to the crowd and saw that everyone was relieved to be relieved. She took out a notebook from her arms and began to announce the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No winter city team, seven points, performed well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc... Seven points? Felice couldn't help but see, the first place is not without the winter city team? Did the two of the sleeping islands capture the remaining eighty evil beasts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All blame," said Lightning, "If she is not halfway to pick up a winter eagle's nest, it also takes an hour to bake the eggs." We should be able to catch a few more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s obviously you let me go..." The pigeons on the top of the little girl’s head are wronged. Muttering, "And you ate the most after roasting, and still did not try to pick a bird to kiss the mushroom, saying that the egg and the mushroom taste better..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It’s good to come back safely... well, then it’s the sleeping island team, fifteen points, it’s not ashamed,” Wendy continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is just an errand," Andrea sighed. "The evil beasts are all knocked down by me. Unfortunately, the monsters encountered are missing. She didn’t run fast enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash didn’t squint at the other person, “You try to run wild boar in the snow. Looking back and forth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only muscles are suitable for this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is also stronger than someone who can't help but wind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough Cough," Wendy quickly interrupted the dispute between the two. "The last is the Taqila team, a total of 22 points! Congratulations, the one-month share of Chaos Beverage Award is yours!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, it’s so enviable!" Andrea was not willing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to drink too..." Mai looked at Ai Gesha with an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis was surprised. "There are hundreds of evil beasts in the cage..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, that's all the leaves to grab." Wendy smiled and waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves are embarrassed to touch the back of the head. "Because there are too many evil beasts in the hunting area, I set a trap zone of about one kilometer around the perimeter, only allowing them to pass through a few fixed passages. Later I thought about it. The evil beasts that enter the vine traps can't just run away, just drag them all to the edge of the forest, so that Roland can add more targets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On-site time The bird is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one person’s power, the captured evil beast will surpass all the competition team’s gains, or will be completed in the process of monitoring the game, the league’s high Is there such a terrible fighting witch hidden in the ranks of the promoters? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is super-excellent, you can't catch so many evil beasts in one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inexplicable frustration and stunned feeling is going on...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice Suddenly I felt that the first place in the game was not that important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The next day, no winter city finally completed all the preparations for the artillery drill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland came to the western section of the city wall, the sides of the wall were already crowded with the people who came to watch the exercise - two thousand seats were swept away Empty, according to the statistics of Itis, 80% of the ticket purchasers are residents of the original Bianbu Town. Obviously, for the local people, spending two silver wolves to participate in the activities attended by His Majesty the King is no longer an unbearable burden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky in the west seems to be in line with this exercise. The whole night’s heavy snow stopped in the early morning, and the whistling north wind also eased. a bit. The vast wilderness to the west of the city wall is like a layer of silver-white carpet. The ruts and footprints left by the evil beasts are covered with snow, and they are flat and clean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil beast as a target has undoubtedly become the focus of the audience - more than a hundred trophies are at a distance of three hundred meters, five hundred meters and one kilometer. Divided into three rows, the more fierce and burly mixed species, the closer the distance from the city wall. Obviously, these powerful monsters have been turned into flesh-and-blood pieces under the gunfire, which can bring unparalleled enjoyment to the winter city residents who have suffered from the evil moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the smaller ones, they are all filled with embedding of gunpowder. Anyway, the distance is far apart, so you don’t have to look so real. It is more important. In the last row, the cages of the imprisoned beasts are arranged in a rectangle with a length of nearly 100 meters, just waiting for the most radiant glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, the First Artillery Battalion is ready." The Iron Axe boarded the wall and reported it loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland spits out a white air and turns to look at the echo beside him. "Play the decentralized march."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the magic coming out of the echoes, the bright and familiar music instantly resounded through the entire wall. It is clear that this march has been annoyed at the school sports meeting, but now it is echoing again in the absence of winter city, Roland still feels the heart of the heart involuntarily incited. As if the tunes contained the surging power, he couldn't help but stand up and greet the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the confiding people have quieted down and turned their eyes to the end of the long street closest to the city wall. I saw a team of soldiers wearing the same color uniforms appearing on the corner of the street in a neat pace, and came to the pre-set position in an orderly manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that when the first encounter with the evil month two years ago, the city was only slap-sized, and only those who had been trained for less than two months were armed with spears and short guns. Fighting evil spirits on the concrete wall made of masonry, even a common mixed species can make the militia team busy. Now, they can face the higher level of challenges with a slap in the face, and the seemingly powerful evil beast has become the target of no winter city to declare strength. This contrast makes Roland feel excited. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soldiers boarded the wall from the gentle slope, there was a burst of applause from the crowd, and it seemed that they would never stop. He knows that any speech at this moment is no longer necessary, and the audience is expecting only the pleasing roar of the artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
