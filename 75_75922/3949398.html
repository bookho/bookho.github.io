			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later, the First Army Expedition and the Witches finally arrived in Bianbu Town. From the date of departure, this mission took almost half a month. , delayed by five days than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason is that when the fleet embarked on the way home, the fortress agent Pedro Hermon sent a messenger to report the unknown song in the long song fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Roland has already given Perot a reminder, when the disease was discovered, he did the best possible isolation measures to close all the urban areas. For a time, I sent a message to Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the report of the epidemic, Roland let Mai Hao set off quickly, heading east along the Chishui River, looking for a fleet carrying the First Army soldiers and letting They diverted to the Long Song Fortress at the Chishui River branch, and then returned to the town after fighting the evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland led the remaining members of the First Army and the families of the expedition to meet them at the dock, accompanied by a familiar army march, the soldiers excitedly The prince salutes, many people imitate the knight's ceremony and kneel down and shout. After walking down the dock, they and their loved ones hugged together, and the echo sounded the salute at the right time. The atmosphere was very lively and attracted many serfs and fugitives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the castle, Iron Axe gave a complete report on the mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean, there are witches in the enemy who attacked the First Army?" Roland thought for a moment. "This is unlikely to be a mouse." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tasa also thinks that he even thinks that rats are also assigned by other forces, otherwise this scum will rarely leave the nest. It can drive the mouse to have a witch. In addition to mentioning Fei Ke, Wang Du Li left only the church.” Iron Axe said, “Even the big aristocrats can't take out the chips that make the local biggest black street organization move.” Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I’m in the east, but I’m afraid to send the witch out to fight alone. I think the church’s suspicion is bigger.” Roland associates Wen. It’s not surprising that the church and the ashes have a group of secretly trained witches. "Are you sure she is dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By hitting the chest by the nightingale, the chest is broken." The iron axe nodded. "We buried her." In the wheat field, the place where the remains of the soldiers were found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team of three hundred people met a large number of mice on the last day and finally died. Four injuries, the only victim still died in the hands of the enemy witch. The four wounded were shot by the enemy who was approached by the enemy. The firepower of the runner rifle ended the battle without entering the melee phase. The wounded were also properly bandaged. After returning to Bianbu Town, they were immediately treated with Nana Wah. Because of the presence of Lily, the wound was hardly infected, as long as the sputum missed the vital organs and stopped the blood and the wounded survived. Extremely high. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, the first military’s first expedition to achieve such results has made Roland very satisfied. As for being sneaked into the whistle, he didn't know much about this. He only knew that he had to set up a light and dark whistle to monitor each other, but how to get it, or give it to the iron axe to ponder it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s hard, I will hold a ceremony for the award tomorrow, just in the town’s central square, you will inform all the members of the First Army.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the iron axe retired, Roland took a long breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job," he took a bag of char-grilled fish from the drawer and placed it on the table. "If it weren't for you, I'm afraid they are dangerous." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale is out of shape, smiling and accepting the dried fish. "I said before departure, everything has me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the strength of the other party?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being smart, very decisive, it should have been trained for several years. If It wasn't that she turned and tried to resist, and I entered the fog, maybe it would be stained by the powder of the monk she had thrown out.” The night sherm shrugged and told the story, but he knew it was all in the electric light. Between the Flint, "I didn't want to kill her...but when I saw her licking Wendy's gaze, I realized that there was nothing to stop her except death."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Roland was silent for a moment. "Remember the words you told me when you returned from the fortress after defeating the militia team at Tiffco?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
