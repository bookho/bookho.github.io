			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high platform of the steel frame stands in the white snowfield, and it looks a bit like the creation of this era - the regular dense structure, hanging The beam of the ice cone and the wire rope, as well as the wire mesh surrounded by layers, all reveal the industrial beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of people gathered around him to do the preparations before the detonation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the weight of the whole principle device is close to ten tons, the hummingbird has gone to the front line, so it is impossible to carry out the final assembly without the winter city, and only the part allocation can be dragged to the test explosion field. , assembled on site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, its structure itself is very simple, plus the design has considered the need for split transport, the requirements for workers are not high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the difference between "the sun's glow" and other weapons - even if the venue and equipment have been laid out, it still takes a day or two to come Complete the final preparations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment Roland and Anna are standing at the top of the tower, directing the assembly of the device. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next is the core component of the third, pay attention to the interface direction, be careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Everyone listens to my password! Three, two, one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the captain of the worker captain, a silver-white cylinder is slowly pushed into the device in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this step is completed, Roland is relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the cylinder is the main source of energy for this test explosion - two sub-packaged uranium 235 cylinders, each of which has a mass of two Ten kilograms. When the two are combined, a total charge of forty kilograms will be provided. This value is below the critical limit of 53 kilograms. Theoretically, no fission reaction will occur, but as he said before, the criticality is not a fixed value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape, temperature, pressure and other conditions have the potential to change this value, which is the reason why the "nuclear weapon" of purely material is almost no actual value. For example, 52 kilograms of uranium 235 in the state of the sphere seems to be stable, but it is actually a volcano ready to erupt. Even if it is a little impact or vibration, it is possible to make it exceed the critical point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the use of multiple small uranium blocks, although safe, will also make the difficulty of detonation multiplied - when several uranium blocks are integrated into one, The whole can indeed exceed the critical point. The high temperature generated by the fission reaction will cause the uranium block to expand rapidly, and the disguise will reduce its density. The violent explosion will push the raw material away from the distance, thus interrupting the reaction. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, a reasonable configuration not only allows the uranium element to reach a critical point, but also maintains this state for as long as possible in order to exert a fission reaction. power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the gun configuration is called the gun type is that its principle is very similar to that of the old musket. Through the detonation of explosives, a uranium block is pushed to the ground. Another uranium block. Under great pressure, the density of uranium blocks will increase rapidly, even if the quality is slightly lower, it can cross the critical point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the outer casing of the device was connected, Anna personally inserted a can of the package with the warning sign of the radioactive source into the reserved tail interface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was also the last key component of the test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Roland seemed to feel that his face was tied, and he even paused for half a beat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"钋-铍中子源". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the name, it provides a large number of free neutrons for fission and is the most direct way to reduce the threshold. Inside a can-like metal container, there is a row of hollow balls - each ball is about the size of a table tennis ball, the core is a marble-like ball, and it is wrapped in gold foil, and it is surrounded by A circle of honeycombed sepals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the uranium blocks collide, they will also smash the small jar at the bottom of the "barrel". All the hollow spheres will be violently explosive. It is thinner than paper, and after the gold foil breaks, the bracts will be closely attached to the Ryukyu, and the whole body will receive the alpha particles released by the latter, which will ignite the neutrons several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the half-life of 钋210 is only 138 days, providing a replacement interface is an essential design. In addition, it is extremely dangerous to keep the neutron source in the weapon for a long time. After all, the neutron can be self-issued as long as it is contacted. Once the gold foil is damaged, the consequences are unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After loading the neutron source into the principle device, it changes from a mild and harmless thing to being able to engulf the site at any time. Monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Roland knows that his feelings are just illusions, it is impossible for people to capture the changes in the number of neutrons in the environment, but his breathing is still less subconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the principle device is officially completed all preparations before the detonation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anna took his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Order it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the calm and calm eyes of the other, Roland nodded slightly . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the outcome, the Sunlight Project has finally reached this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after this step, humans will travel to a new field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked to the guardian Sean, "Call me orders, inform the command post, countdown to six hours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, squat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"6:00"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜—————呜—————呜——————呜——————”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The No. 1 device has entered the ignition Stage, repeat, the No. 1 device has entered the ignition waiting stage, please immediately pick up the equipment, and leave the venue in accordance with the drill program! Note that this is not an exercise, the test explosion will be closed after an hour, everyone must Before then, evacuate to the safe zone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the evacuation announcement will accompany the alarm sounds throughout the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly, everyone gathers in the open space in front of the tower, don't pull the next person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Construction of the second team, one, two, three..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Explosion block door blockade!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the members of the Wraith Witch team arrived and began to evacuate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quiet snowfield seems to boil, people shout and The alarm sounds repeated over and over again, and the atmosphere became tense and dignified. Everyone knows that they are about to witness an unprecedented experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"3:00"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the command post, Roland and Anna took out two keys, Together open the cover of the console. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a switch is pressed, the green light on the table also lights up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main cable is sending power!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mystery One is working normally and the load is stable Rising."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now switch to line one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand, the line one has Turn on, the principle device is powered normally!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The observer loudly reported the operation of the detonation system until the last green light is on, meaning that the current has passed many times. The boost continued and was transmitted to the high platform 15 kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1:00"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The command post also sounded an alarm, which meant detonation The program only has the last hour left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
