			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suspected that he had misunderstood, "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Book bite his lips, Repeated again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he is convinced that he did not hear the problem himself. Was the witch concerned so concerned about his marriage? "Are you sure that the witch is infertile? Is it because... for some reason, it leads to a wrong understanding? For example, the previous holy mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also Hope is like this," she sighed. "Unfortunately, many examples have confirmed this. Whether it is normal with ordinary people or forced by people, there is no example of a witch's birth. There is no support for the whole society. Other witch organizations have not I have heard of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reproductive isolation"... This word appears in Roland’s mind. Is the witch really completely beyond the ordinary people and become a new human being, so that it is impossible to breed offspring with the old humans? Or is it because the magic is concentrated in the body, which leads to this phenomenon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now is not the time to get to the bottom, he thinks, the key is its impact. Does this hinder the idea of ​​wanting to marry a witch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland first thought of Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s a shame not to raise an offspring with Anna, the premise that he will like children is based on the love of Anna. No children will not reduce this love. . And for a person with a modern soul, the relationship between his descendants and him is far less important than the blood heritage emphasized by the ancients. As a separate life individual, he does not regard the child as a continuation of his own - the latter can not inherit the thought, nor inherit the memory, but an independent person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So emotionally, he can accept that the witch is not able to bear this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only real obstacles - the heir problem. However, this is still not a trivial matter for Roland, who has a long history. It is only necessary to build an empire that does not require heirs. There are many options for this implementation. He can think about it later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Roland was surprised to find that this was a major positive news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to construct a social framework in which a new human witch and ordinary people can live in peace and progress together is a question that he has been thinking after talking with the night. But he found that even if there is a stone of curse, as long as the time is long enough, the witches and their descendants will always form a stronger group - even if the technology develops so that ordinary people can use the magic, it can not make up for the witch in intelligence, A comprehensive lead in memory and speed of thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now he is told that the witch is infertile. This greatly avoided the formation of family groups, weakened the gap between the witch group and ordinary people, and let him see the hope of the two together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that I have been thinking for too long, and the nightingale can’t help but grab his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland returned from his thoughts, he patted the other’s back in a comforting manner, and cleared his throat, “I thought so before, now I still think so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The book was smashed for a moment, "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The hand on the arm was grasped in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but laugh out. Before he doubted whether he had got it wrong, is it now his turn? He coughed twice and re-stated: "Now I still think so - I am willing to marry a witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the book was very strange when it left, like a satisfied, slightly sad, and looked at Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had to ask about the nightingale around him, "Is she alright?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter did not answer Instead, looking at Roland with a smile, the sunlight outside the window reflected on her white face and supple hair, bright and exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door of the office was ringing. "His Highness, the long song fortress came to the knight, and he said that there is information to be handed over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take him to the living room, I will come later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the prince walked into the hall, the knight stepped over and shouted on one knee. The adult told me to tell you that Tiefko Wimbledon sent the messenger group and has arrived at the long song fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The messenger group?" Roland sinks "How many people did they come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of about fifty people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that It seems that he is dismissed from the team. He thinks that if it is just diplomatic means, he will not hurt himself. "When did they arrive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yesterday In the morning, "The Cavaliers sighed," Pedro, let me hurry and let you know as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one day, I’m afraid at night Going on the road with a torch, "Working hard, good. Take a good day off and return.” Roland looked at the guard and gave a confession. “Take a golden dragon to him and take him to the hotel.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Cavaliers left, Roland wanted to put this matter aside, after all, the team of 50 people had no threat to the town. Just for the sake of negotiation, the leader alone could come in. However, considering that Perot is so cautious, it is better to keep track of where the messenger is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he recruited lightning and wheat, let them fly to the fortress one after the other to check the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, the two witches completed the investigation and returned to the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no discovery," Lightning reported. "There were no 50-person knights on the road, and even the Knights who had placed the order did not see one." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't see a cockroach!" Mai said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that after they have traveled long distances to the big cities, they need to have fun for themselves and ease their tired body. Roland puts his heart down. "Before the arrival of the messenger group, you will investigate every day along the way." He paused. "Right, how was the map you painted before?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably put a few hundred, almost all of Soroya's room is full," said Lightning. "She has moved the map to the backyard now, do you want to see it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay," Roland laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The backyard of the castle has become a botanical garden. Since Sean brought back the crop seeds of the clear water port, the things planted here are even more strange. Moreover, in order to save land and flower beds, the leaves set up wooden shelves in the sky, so that many plants grow like vines, and even climbed to the half of the wall of the castle. Now the grapes behind the castle are covered with grapes, apples, wheat and sugar cane. When the witches are fine, they will gather in the backyard and eat some fruits and sugar cane from the wall. It is a pity that these crops must grow under the magic of the leaves, and they can only be regarded as test pieces that are not completely successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The map is placed in the center of the yard, with five or six square meters, made up of a piece of parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are here," Lightning grabbed Roland's waist with one hand, and slowly floated with him, floating over the map, "You see Is that slap in the big taupe square? From the sky, Bentham Town is like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The east and south blue places... Is it Sea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but it is necessary to climb over a mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is in the slightest At a glance, if it is quite normal for the wilderness to be dozens of times larger than the gray fort, it is not expected that when the complete big map is completely present, the west is actually so narrow. There is a desolate mountain in front, and there is a sea in the back. It is like a piece of edge on the edge of the sky. No...not just the West, he fills up the unpainted parts in his mind. If you look at the desolate mountains that divide the mainland as a wall, the gray castle, or even the entire "continent", is just one behind the wall. Small interception of land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
