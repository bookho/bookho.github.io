			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go away! Dirty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone pushed her hard However, she did not move, but looked at each other and stepped back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogant look suddenly disappeared from his face, and after glance at her, the other side left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is unmoved and continues to move to the crowd. When I saw this woman in a broken dress, most people frowned and avoided. In this way, she slowly moved to the entrance of the inner city of the gray castle king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already a sea of ​​people. Although there are no traditional walls and gates in the inner city, people have erected a symbolic gate made of wooden strips and garlands. On both sides of the door, there is a neatly dressed warrior in full body, and the exquisite armor reflects the dazzling luster in the sun. The eagle-shaped hollow armor with wings on its shoulders and the iris flower hanging from the chest are matched with the handsome faces of the warriors, and a group of rich women yells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red fluffy cloak of the samurai behind him has been dragged to the ground, looking like a red partition. It was these handsome and mighty warriors who separated the crowd and vacated a road a few feet behind the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roadside flags are crowded, and many long strips of gold color flags hang from the top of the flagpole, which is very solemn. Many different patterns are embroidered on the flag, the most of which are the tall tower rifles. She knows that this pattern represents the gray castle royal family and is the organizer of today's ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the rite of the fifth king, Tilly Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week ago, this matter has been advertised and it is well known throughout the city. In addition to the local aristocrats of the Grey Fort, the embassy of other kingdoms also came a lot. They carry gifts and marriage contracts, hoping to get the favor of the five kings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church will also send a bishop to preside over the ceremony for her, which will be held at the Twilight Square in the center of the city. At that time, the royal family will distribute meat porridge and soup, which is why it attracts so many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she is not coming for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her goal is the Archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to kill an archbishop in the eyes of the kings, and it will inevitably make the church faceless and majestic. This sweet vengeful taste always makes her excited. She touched her chest, where there was a short knife that was stolen. Although the quality was inferior, killing a mortal was enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a burst of cheers in the crowd suddenly interrupted her thoughts. She looked into the inner city, and the Knights of the Kingdom lined up neatly. The knights who were at the forefront were dressed up and shiny, and the cloak of the red-rimmed gold rim behind them was like a cluster of flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a carriage of four horses dragging in parallel, and the emblem of the gray castle royale is carved on the wall, and the wheels and the frame are all gold-plated. The red flag is floating on the roof, and the silk embroidered with gold silk is hung in the corners of the carriage. At first glance, the whole team seems to be a moving golden ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of people accompanied the team to the Twilight Square, she was also mixed in the crowd, and entered the periphery of the square - the inner circle has been isolated by the guards, only the nobility can be near Distance viewing ceremony. She estimated that it was only necessary to count the time when she rushed to the past. As long as the Archbishop climbed the square, it was impossible to escape from her own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal family have jumped off the carriage. Slowly embarked on the Central Court, probably the five children of Wimbledon III. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among these people, she saw the five kings, Tilly Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the five kings are the protagonists of today - her eyes are full of agile light, as if the gems are transparent; the simple partial bangs are refreshed The long gray hair, without any embellishments; looks particularly outstanding among her group of brothers and sisters; the dress pattern on her body is not complicated, and her temperament is exactly right. And the most incredible thing is that she actually turned her eyes over the layers of people and directly invested in herself. Then, as if she greeted her, she nodded slightly and smiled at the corner of her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
