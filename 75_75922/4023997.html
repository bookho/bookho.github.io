			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s damn, the minds of these witches have begun to scatter, and Herti angrily thinks, when they are still on the island of Dagong, where do they ask why? It is the enemy of the bloody teeth, and there is only one dead road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment can affect a person most, the fierce and fierce rock wolf in the mountains and cliffs, and the dog nest can only produce stupid and incompetent dogs. The auxiliary witch brought a large golden dragon and supplies to the island through the "Sleeping Curse", which made it become a safe and unsafe playground. Even the fighting witch began to believe in Terry's fooling and leaving her time. Obviously not much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should be able to control the seed's time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, don't let it take effect immediately after planting rest, wait until Anne is shipped with the beauty, and then quietly send her on the road." Herti nodded Dao, "Now, let's visit the old traitor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Anne died on the boat with the symptoms of cold plague, the crew To avoid infection, the corpse will be thrown into the sea, so that no one can detect the incident anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to do it during the day?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The evening will only be more suspicious, and Camilla will not necessarily let me go to the palace," Herti glanced at her, "Shaqi just happened to hear. There is a witch from the wolf heart who is sick and comatose. As a representative of the wolf heart kingdom, is it not normal to go to visit the condition?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The adults said yes," Tian Yan pulled up the hood behind the robes. "Even if we don't go, Tilly and Camilla will still suspect us if she has an accident."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty put on the raincoat and opened the door. The wind rushed into the house with the rain, and she waved her hand behind her, and then went into the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has made up her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people walked to the palace compound and acted on duty for Camilla. Rui immediately appeared at the door. "You are this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard Shaki say that there is a wolf-hearted new witch on the island?" Hetty Morgan shrugged. "It is said that her condition is a bit bad. We have come to see her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annie has fallen asleep under the help of Jura, I I think you should not bother her better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just want to take a look, because the name is quite familiar, maybe she has been to the blood, but I lost with us when I fled from Dagong Island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Kamila hesitated. "Well, please come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few short conversations have already consumed Herti’s patience. A normal witch in the district has taken this place as her own site, sleeping in the island butler. She secretly sneered, but it was a dog under Tilly's hand. If it is not the last sentence, please plan to enter, she intends to let the other party suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because most of the shelters on the island are raised from the ground by the lotus, there is rarely a layer of architecture, and Tilly’s palace is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the long corridor to the side room, Kamila turned sideways. "She is inside."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Herti couldn’t wait to enter the house, then swayed to Tianyan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter carefully looked at the woman who closed her eyes on the bed and nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who was she sent from?" Herti walked over to Camilla and asked her voice, seemingly caring about each other, actually thinking Block the sight of the big butler. Just by giving her a dying day, she can plant the rest into Anne's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camilla did not answer, but revealed a strange expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heti couldn't help but have no time to react. The sundial behind him has already screamed. "This witch is fake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is so fierce However, I saw that the people on the bed had disappeared, leaving only a black ball that was condensed by magic to stand in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The kind of rest...you got it," Camilla shook her head. "I thought you were just talking to the fighting witch, but I didn't expect it." It’s a ferocious murderer!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Shut up!” Herti couldn’t help but resent her, the deadly magic flew straight toward the other side, At the moment she was hit, the figure disintegrated into a white mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herty knows everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shadow!" She gnashed her teeth, "You get me out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corridor There was a rush of footsteps, and the witch who was clearly hidden in the dark was fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tian Yan, grab her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the latter rushed out of the side room He took a deep breath and then spit out a raging flame. The hot flame was like his own consciousness. He crawled along the wall and chased him away. He burned the door frame and the window all the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" There was a scream in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, we have to leave here as soon as possible!" The Japanese eagerly said, "They are cheating you, this is a trap!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walking from the window," the shadow of the whining sounds, but Heti also understands that this place is not suitable for a long time, but she does not understand, why does Tilly know that bloody teeth will be a few years ago? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned out of the palace, the three suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the heavy rain, a black woman appeared in the garden. Her eyes were like golden stars, even in the rain and fog. Obviously, they did not carry any weapons. Just standing there made them feel great pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the witch is ashamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She generally only stays with Tilly Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty turned his head and saw two other familiar figures at the entrance to the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia and Shadow. Especially the latter, if they were stunned at them, it was obvious that the screams were just pretending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them are only able to say that Tilly has not left the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty’s heart is completely sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing to explain, if you surrender now, I can't kill you," Ash said in a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one thinks that she is bragging, as a mortal, as long as she wears the stone of God's punishment, it is the natural enemy of all witches. If it weren't for her existence, Herti would not endure to this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...not without a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakthrough point is at the entrance to the palace - as long as you can hold the two, maybe you can threaten the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hardly hesitated, grabbed the sundial and rushed to the main entrance of the palace, "Tianyan, entangled in the ashes!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a fighting witch, when the ability does not work, 匕 and 弩 弩 become the best weapon. Tianyan pulled out the short scorpion and rushed to the ashes, and the sundial also understood her intentions and summoned the symbiotic species in her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat of no shock is useless, and Hetty is determined to kill one of them, leaving only one as a hostage, and the goal is naturally to mock them for a long time. Shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
