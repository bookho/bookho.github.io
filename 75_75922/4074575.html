			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice was surprised, "This light is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know It’s probably to return the magic to the world,” Roland patted the ash on his hand. “We have to get out of here, or we will be bothered by others.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Can this guy be an enemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the enemy, but not everyone has the power to deal with the enemy," he explained, "the era. Different, even those who are extremely vicious and wicked can only be arrested and tried by specialized departments and personnel. Of course, the demon is more special, and Garcia has mentioned that the martial arts of the demon They will receive a hunting license issued by the association, which not only allows them to start with suspicious targets, but also legally kills the normal awakened people who are trying to fish in troubled waters. If this matter is announced, it will undoubtedly cause a wave of public opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weird times," Felice commented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked out of the Kaifeng restaurant, and the chaotic order outside has begun to ease - probably seeing the people who suddenly left, let the people who have escaped in the future They are relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a few steps, Roland saw the rushing against the crowd, all the way to the side of the clean radish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her look is anxious, the hair band on her head has also spread, and the long white hair is scattered on her shoulders, which is very messy. Several people around tried to stop her, but she used her small body and flexible steps to escape, until she saw Roland, her expression changed from anxiety to joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this joy only lasted for a few seconds, and the little girl slammed the raised mouth and angered. "Why are you guys?" I just ran out now? Even the tortoises are running faster than you, uncle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her panting, her cheeks are red, Roland I couldn't help but bend down and touched her head. "Sorry, I am worried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is worried about you, I am worried about Felice. Sister!" Jielu glanced at him. "The first time she came to the city, what if she was crowded out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that said, the little girl still honestly accepted the full set of touches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, Luo Lan had a great effort to explain why they had encountered something and why it came out so slowly - when the second part was fabricated . After learning that "the two people were accidentally attacked by the demon, and almost could not run out," her dissatisfaction subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there was no further accident in the next trip. After they bought the clothes, Roland went to the hot pot restaurant to solve the dinner. As a distinctive food, hot pot is not only strong in flavor, rich in food, but also relatively cheap, as long as you order more potatoes, noodles and scallions that are easy to fill your stomach when you order, three people pay for it. Start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of Felice is not much better than when it was opened in the Kaifeng restaurant. The alternating stimulation of spicy and delicious fragrance made her unable to stop the spoon, tearful eyes. I don't know if it was spicy, or the tears that moved me... In the end, even the pot of red oil soup was drunk by her, and the people around him were stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the group returned to the package, it was nine o'clock in the evening. Roland climbed up to the eighth floor and accidentally found the figure of Garcia when he walked to the door of his apartment. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood in the middle of the aisle with a cold face, and the low pressure around her could almost be felt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she hangs up, she has been waiting for her here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took a slap in the mouth and shouted, "Look... I really went out with my relatives--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We can talk about it now," Garcia interrupted his words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the other party’s tone is a bit rough, and Felice frowned. “Hey...please pay attention to your attitude, this is the Lord of the world— —”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
