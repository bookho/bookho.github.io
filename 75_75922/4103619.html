			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a heavy rain in the jungle that diluted the bloody smell of the corpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s an ordinary hunter, it’s likely that the target is missed, but for Luo Jia, the smell in the air after the rain is enough to tell her a lot of information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there is not only one animal carcass - some have a pure bloody taste, while others have a rancid smell, which proves that many animals have died In one place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small prey such as rabbits, rats, and foxes can hardly spread the breath to such a distant place, and even if it is, it should not be so clear. In other words, the basics of death are large animals, at least not smaller than cattle and horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to drag these big guys to a place must have the corresponding power, and the behavior of bringing together multiple bodies is mostly out of meat. The habit of animals storing food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This location is often the nest of large predators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the most important point is that Luo Jia has captured an indescribable turbidity in the smell, which is unique to the blood of the mixed species. the taste of. If she does not change into a wolf shape, she can only smell the stench of pungent. Only after she has demonstrated her ability can she perceive the subtle differences hidden in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the taste of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every hybrid can store magic, but the magic in the blood must be mixed, and the strength is far beyond the general evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also one of the advances that jungle hunting has brought to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she can master this skill before the sacred duel, the four-winged eagle who launched the raid from the air could not catch her clothes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the weather, environment and prey of the wilderness are far from the desert, the hunting skills are universal - summed up nothing more than three points, Be cautious, meticulous and patient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia’s goal is a burly bear-type hybrid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands up to three people high, and it looks like a whole moving tower. I don't know which evil beasts are mixed. Its skin is like a hyperthyroidism. Even a sharp wolf can't kill a fate. What is even more shocking is that the head-bear species actually has four eyes, two of which are behind the head, which makes her the most powerful attack, bloodletting and throat loss also lost the effect of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five days ago, Luo Jia had handed over to the other side. After a bad battle, she broke two claws, and the bear species dropped half of the forefoot. Bloody scars on the stomach. It can be said that this is the most intractable enemy she encountered after entering the wild land, and its intensity is comparable to that of the desert beast. If it wasn’t for the full tempering beforehand, I would have met this guy from the beginning, and it’s probably her who fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is a hunting, not a fair duel - she carries the herbs cultivated with leaves, the purified water made by Lily, and the powerful after the transformation. Resilience, no need to worry about ordinary injuries. These days, in addition to healing the wound, the rest of her time was spent searching for bears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the smell grows stronger, Loja knows that the outcome will soon be known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gently straddles a piece of water, and the pad is immersed in moist soil with almost no sound. Choosing the cut-in position is the downwind, and it will be difficult for the other party to detect her presence through the smell. A little closer to the source of the scent, she erected her ears and used the sound to locate the direction of the target, while lifting the claws slowly to open the vines in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the bear-type hybrid appears in her sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party knows nothing about her arrival, is burying a bite of a fat buck, spouting blood covered with its cheeks, plus The broken limb with exposed bones looks very horrible. If it is an ordinary animal, if it is so severely injured, it will be slouched in a hidden place, and it will not be swayed before it is cured. But it doesn't seem to care about those wounds, it seems that filling the stomach is more tight than anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as she was ready to go, another string of footsteps suddenly came from the depths of the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Luo Jia a bit guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there such a rhythmic double-footed point in the depths of the wild? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steps are heavy, there is no hidden meaning, the alternate stepping sounds are unique to humans, and ... more than one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the hunter without the winter city lost? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... She quickly denied this speculation, which is more than ten days away from the Grey Fort Border, considering the dense forests, the grass, and the land It will only be slower. Not to mention the fierce beasts and snakes everywhere after crossing the prairie. As for the ruins of Takira, there is a place where mixed species of evil beasts are found. Even if you are lost, you can't live here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia suddenly thought of an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A seemingly reasonable and long-awaited answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, she felt the cold hairs of the whole body erected, and the heart seemed to jump straight - even though the nerves were highly stressed, the body instantly entered the best Combat status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear species also noticed this unusual sound, it dropped half of the deer's legs, rolled over and climbed, hoarsely whispering toward the footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bushes shook, the staggered branches were pushed open, and the two faceted monsters came out of the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black-brown skin, muscle-knotted arms, fully-enclosed animal bone helmets, and sharp bone spears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same as the description in the lightning bolt -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the devil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally waited! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the devil appeared, the bear-type hybrid slammed into the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It lifts the good forefoot and rushes toward the uninvited guest who disturbs his meal. The speed is not like that of a sturdy body. The action that comes out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shot, in addition to the power of the bear species itself, also comes with the impact of the entire body, the effect is no less than the height of the four-winged eagle Dive. In exchange for the three princesses, the first reaction must be avoided. After all, if it is not an extraordinary person, even if it can block this palm, it will pay a small price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the enemy does not retreat! One of the devil's arms quickly swelled up and directly greeted the giant palm of the evil beast. With a muffled sound, the two monsters collided without any buffer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is a balance of power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s a bear or a devil, you can’t go any further. Just a single round of individual, the devil is shorter than the other half, and the stalemate is obviously not good for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is not only one devil on the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other madman has removed the bone spear and aimed at the mixed species. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is about to end, leaving little time for Luo Jia to consider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you walking or staying? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the pipes behind them are the weakness of the devil, they are not good to deal with," she suddenly sounded a warning of lightning in her mind. "If you really meet the enemy." It is best to retreat immediately and tell the news to Roland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also told her that this time should be temporarily retired, but the instinct to fight is Her chest is boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is not a question to consider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
