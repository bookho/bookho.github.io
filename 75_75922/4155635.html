			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the direction of the radio, even if they are kilometers apart, they can be shaped like a whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three formations have a total of seventy-five Skyfires arriving at the interception airspace at about the same time, and they rushed from the three directions to the devil’s beastly army. Interlaced scissors, instantly interrupt the enemy queue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of the Desperate War has hit the largest air battle to date, and it has opened the curtain over the woe's desperate mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, the roar of the devil and the roar of the engine resounded through the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beast that was hit fell spirally down, and no matter how powerful the driver is, the helper can only helplessly fall. It eventually turned into a blue spot on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two sides crossed, the original neat formation no longer exists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the flight manual, the empty knight should get rid of the enemy's pursuit as soon as possible, use the speed advantage to re-open the distance, and then turn to the next round of attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free to open fire, free to fire!" Tilly gave instructions to take the lead, with the Phoenix's abundant power first rushed out of the fighting circle - probably the fuselage The color is too eye-catching, and there are several fearful beasts following the path of her path, which is what she had expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she can attract more enemies, the pressure on her teammates will be smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you pull out enough space, the Air Knights will be more suitable for the battle of the sky than the fearful beast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, beware! There is a big guy who is eyeing you!" There was a reminder from Goode in the headphones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, I can see." Tilly turned her head and glanced. "Pay attention to your own position. If you need support, I will call it!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the performance of the Phoenix is ​​far better than the Skyfire and the Skyfire, she did not give herself a chance - in addition to having confidence in the car, there is no wing The function keeps up with her pace, and it is more capable of playing its own performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tili took the wind and took the lead in completing the climb and turn. Her beasts chasing her are still trying to flap their wings and want to draw closer to each other. When the two sides face each other again, the enemy apparently does not realize that they have changed from a chaser to a prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Phoenix slammed down and Tilly decisively pressed the shooting button! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a good shooting range, she doesn't even need to use a two-wing machine gun to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four dazzling light strips are sprayed out from the nose, and are affected by the relative displacement to draw a beautiful arc in the air, straight into the beast from the top of the head In the group--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After she asked the 8mm general-purpose machine gun to fire the ground target, there was a lack of firepower, and Roland put the production of larger-caliber weapons on the agenda. As a special machine that combines all kinds of top technologies, Phoenix is ​​naturally the first to taste the sweetness. In the huge nose, the four 20mm cannons are arranged symmetrically in the left and right, and can shoot nearly seven thousand shells per minute, bringing the killing ability to an unprecedented level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although her goal this time is not the ground madness and the spider demon, but the body shape is obviously larger than other similar beasts, indicating that the owner of this guy is a High-ranking devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to deal with such diverse enemies is to destroy them before they show their abilities! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of the beast in front is penetrated by a machine gun, and the warhead that hits the chest and abdomen will drag a series of blood rain, which is especially outstanding in the air. Eye-catching. When the light band approached the high-level devil, the latter made a roar, and several layers of blue shields immediately surrounded it, as if they had put on a solid armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But only a moment later, the "armor" was shattered, broken, disintegrated at a speed visible to the naked eye in a sparkling collision - then huge The impact of the whole belt flew up and rolled to the ground. At this height, if there is no fusion of flying magic stones or other life-saving signs, there must be no possibility of survival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
