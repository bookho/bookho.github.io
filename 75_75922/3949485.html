			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly injects magic into the flying magic stone and jumps up into the air, overlooking the entire deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautifully beautiful crew members are mostly experienced sailors. After the initial panic, they picked up the weapons and beasts around them and gradually became a group. The direction of the tower is close. Obviously they also know that their own strength cannot defeat so many enemies. The only hope lies in the witches on board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation quickly changed as the ashes joined the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is like a gust of wind. Wherever she goes, she is the scream and mourning of the monster. Any evil beast that dares to face the giant sword will be cut off and the limbs will be broken. The broken arm is full of decks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia is not far behind, her magic longbow can shoot any object as an arrow, the power and accuracy are amazing. Therefore, she rarely prepares regular feather arrows, but a bag of glass beads. The evil beasts that she hit didn't even have a scream, and they twitched softly on the ground—hard marbles were enough to penetrate the head in twenty steps and stir the skull into a mass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind and the gauze walked back and forth on the deck to help the injured sailors, with the protection of the invisible barrier, the evil beast could not get close to the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the evil beast was quickly killed, Tilly still did not relax her vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These fish-shaped monsters are obviously not enough to cause the violent sway of the first beautifully beautiful person - it feels like a huge monster hitting the bottom of the boat underwater general. Without Molier's servant protection, the impact of this kind of collision will come several times, and the ship will probably turn into a pile of broken planks floating on the sea. The witches can barely protect themselves, and the sailors of a ship estimate that few can escape the burial of the belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, when the last evil beast was flattened by the ashes of the ashes, a huge shadow appeared in the sea in front of the left side of the hull. - That is definitely not the shape that the fish can reach. The shadow quickly approaches the surface of the water and hits the beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" she shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, the shadows passed under the boat, and the sailboat swayed again. The two masts made a series of shocking sounds, as if they would crash down at any time. Fortunately, the shadow did not make other attacks, and quickly disappeared into the depths of the sea - probably it was to use the spine to knock over the beauty, and then eat a meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly fell back to the deck and told the story briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It must be forced out of the sea, otherwise the damn monster will sink the ship sooner or later." The ash frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will try," said Sawyer. "Since it is attached to the bottom of the boat, as long as the distance is close enough, I can block it with a barrier. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poseidon is on," Old Jack wiped the sweat from his forehead. "If the other person is as big as Tilly’s adult, it’s unusual. The attack is afraid of not playing any role. Even if it is forced out of the sea, how can it be killed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me," Andrea will slip The hair ends behind the ear, revealing a confident smile. "In the ten steps, no enemy can eat my full blow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow It appeared very quickly, this time it changed direction and rushed from the stern to the beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly in the air surveillance immediately issued an early warning signal, the yarn swayed to the position and jumped out of the string, the waist was firmly tied with a few loops of hemp rope - rope The other end is held in the hands of the ashes, which controls the lowering height of the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows struck, the gauze opened the barrier instantly, and a gap suddenly appeared in the gray sea, as if it was separated by something invisible. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster slammed into the barrier, the huge figure suddenly stagnated, the gauze snorted, and the hands fell softly, as if it cost a lot strength. I saw that the shadow under her feet quickly expanded and the sea water rose up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on her!" Tily swooped down and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
