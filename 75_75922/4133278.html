			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ending the conversation with the front line, the nightingale put a silver-white seal ring at his desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a special messenger for flying messengers. It is made of two aluminum sheets and can accommodate a piece of slap-shaped scroll in the interior, compared to the original The practice of directly attaching the cloth to the claws has evolved a lot, and with the "ultra-thin paper" made by Soroya, the amount of information transmitted by the secret letter has increased substantially. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the distance exceeds 500 kilometers, the chance of accidents in the flight messenger will become unnegligible, so the administrative offices of all localities have set relay nodes. In order to efficiently sort the secret letter, the identification number is also printed on the buckle, which is equivalent to the ticket of the next generation. Just look at it and you will see where the secret letter is sent from and where it will be sent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the initial letter C on this buckle represents that it came from the morning kingdom - Roland set the system for confidential reasons, for direct use. Pinyin abbreviation, not the standard characters common to the four kingdoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the morning thorns town?" He raised an eyebrow. "When did you get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just ten minutes ago, honey came." The nightingale replied, "But I see that you are on the phone, you have not interrupted you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What new discovery has been found in the remains of the Cage Mountains? Roland opened the buckle and spread the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content on the letter was a bit long, and it took him half a quarter of an hour to understand the recent situation of the guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect that the church would have a day to ask for help from Graysburg." Putting down the stationery, Roland couldn't help but feel a sigh, even though he knew that once he gave up Hermes, They will never have a chance to make a comeback. It is no problem to be a strong man in a remote place. As a result, the bishop who gave the fugitive a fatal blow was the church's former bishop. It must be said that this was a dramatic ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The group of orphans who left the Abbey of the Holy City, the dog of the funeral family who left alone, has fallen?" The nightingale was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the letter is correct, the church is almost gone." Roland handed the letter to the other party. "Their hopes have betrayed them." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night owl looked at him after reading the letter. "What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Since the stewards of the Count of Dagong Island have all been confessed, the treasures of the relics have also fallen, and it is a matter of time to send people to the wolf heart." Roland gently tapped the table and said, "The ritual can only concentrate on high-purity uranium." The film reacts, so the picture in the mural may not be purely artistic fiction. No matter what its role, it is best to be controlled by the winter city. As for the captive church agent Farina..." Aton, "just brought it back with Joe and was judged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It really looks like your style answer." The nightingale smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you wouldn't like this answer." Roland said in a wording, "The church has cruelly persecuted you after all."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really hate the church, and even hate humans." The nightingale said calmly, "but since I knew that it was the same as the witch Akaris, and Everything is done to continue the idea, and the idea has changed. It is hard to hate it again, but she feels that she is both pitiful and sad. Not to mention that the church that was built up by the Star City has now vanished, I just want to To retaliate, you can't find the target."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey...ha you hate humans?" Roland asked with surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s weird if you don’t hate it," the night glanced at him. "The magic awakening is not something I can control. I didn't take it everywhere to do evil. Why?" To be driven like a street mouse? Since you treat me as a different kind, then why should I get along with you in the same way - this is probably the idea at the time. And I dare say that most witches have had similar emotions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, will the dagger appear in my bedroom at the beginning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time, it was already enough restraint," the nightingale laughed. "The idea of ​​hating humans is just a faint idea, but it is really cheap to hate the nobles. If it is not because Anna is in your hands, I am I won't have the patience to sit down and talk to you... Have you forgotten my previous title?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
