			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the days of "Wolf" are here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was just a light shining out of the window, and Victor was awakened by the sound of Sosso. He opened his eyes and found that one side of the pillow was empty, leaving only a few strands of hair, and the girl's faint body fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exquisite?" he said in a slightly dry voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big, adults, are you awake?" The respondent seemed to be a little scared. "Is it too big for me to bother you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jeweler turned over and climbed up, sitting on the head of the bed, his face could not help but reveal a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw the maid wearing the method, the long skirt was only half-finished, and the smooth back was exposed, with a half-covered chest. Don't have a charm that makes you feel pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... can you look at me like this?" Ling Yan said with a red face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the feeling that the noble lady will never bring, Victor laughed low. "Good, I don't see it. But there is a little you." You know, no one else can help you, you can't wear it alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诶..." The other party was a little overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, I will help you." He applauded. "But let me drink first, I am thirsty."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After tying the tie, Victor touched the waist of the maid, "Complete It's quite right for you - don't look at the dress looks thin. Before the retractable belt was invented, the servants responsible for dressing the Missy had to choose five big three thick ones, otherwise there is really no way to close it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be the case," the girl vomited and said, "I heard it for the first time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of things in the nobility. They look good, but they are very troublesome to use. In short, they are flashy." He smiled. "Why, can't wait to wear it out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, I just want to get ready soon, so as not to delay your trip -" Linglong waved again and again, "I will go to you to wash your water now, ready to go early . "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; wearing this one to do what groceries? Victor looked at the maid who was obviously in excitement and didn't dismantle it. "Go, freshly baked bread with omelettes, don't forget to give yourself a copy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, thank you adults," she bowed reverently before going out. "And thank you for sending me clothes... and this opportunity."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door was covered, Victor climbed out of bed and poured himself a glass of red wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another kind of good for this kind of woman. With a little favor, you can get great feedback and gratitude. If the gift is a young lady, maybe even a smile is ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighty golden dragons are nothing to him. It is much more interesting for two people to appreciate drama than for one person. This has nothing to do with generosity and love. It’s all right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing he is curious about now is, to what extent will the magic of the value of the 40th Golden Dragon be wonderful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, are you really going?" Roentgen looked neatly dressed Kajin Fez, with a worried color, "Although Mey has said that he will recommend your new drama to His Majesty the King, it may be just a blind man - if she wants to use his fame to create momentum for herself. "Would you go to the middle of her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so...now she is not at all trustworthy." Aegpo muttered "Which recommended new drama, can she still see it if she can see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
