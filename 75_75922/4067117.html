			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, the results of the accident treatment are counted out," Barov and the book went into Roland's office together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Roland asked with concern. "How is the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately Fortunately, no one was seriously injured," the reply from the head of the city hall relieved him. "The three fractures, all accidentally fell when they fled; the two lost their hearing, it should be caused by the explosion; One person burned, but after the treatment of Miss Nana, everyone has recovered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The teacher at the lunch break in the lounge immediately organized the loud noise Withdrawal, Film Hilter claimed that the first army was performing exercises, simulating the enemy raids, asking students to cooperate with the action, and not to panic. This statement kept the order on the scene stable - except for the sixth class that witnessed the witch's awakening. The book added, "So the fractures and deaf injuries are all students in the same class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a dawn," Roland couldn’t help but praise. Tao, using the great prestige of the First Army in the absence of the Winter City, it is convenient to control the order and reduce Little panic. In this way, it is equivalent to reducing the impact to a minimum. As long as the remedy is correct afterwards, most people will not realize that the witch awakening is actually a very dangerous process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it’s also crucial that the awakened keep the ability in a very small range - the huge explosion comes from the current breaking through the air, and The metal latch on the window is caused by an arc path. Like the principle of thunder, it sounds earth-shattering, but the damage is not strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the fire, it was Ai Gesha’s masterpiece. When she arrived at the scene, it only took a few minutes to freeze the fire source and spare the main teaching building. - Although Roland is already considering whether to replace these houses with brick-and-mortar structures to avoid similar things happening again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, how are you going to deal with this?" Barov asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any thoughts?" Roland knocked on the table and didn't answer directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think it should be divided into two things." The general manager has been indulging for a moment. "The fight between children is not the key, mainly because of the off-site behind it. Conflict. According to the current situation, both sides of the conflict come from the south and come from the east. The reason is also because the dispute is whether the east is caused by the rebellion. You know, the territory of Tefco is exactly the gold of the east. Suicheng, and there has not been surrendered to you so far. So..." He paused and concealed the latter half of the story. He probably didn't want to talk too much about the royal struggle. "In short, if there are no adults who claim behind the scenes, the children It is unlikely that these things will be known. The parents of the conflicting initiators will be severely punished and the announcement of a ban on the discussion of the rebel will be put an end to such conflicts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ...you go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second point is that the witch awakening may cause harm to the people. My suggestion is, no matter what you do. , it is written into the law, which can be effective . Free disputes "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; watched with interest boss Roland a tube, undecided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it’s proven that the root cause behind the fight is that Barov has a broader vision, which is obviously not the former assistant secretary of finance. Can be aware of - in the two years of ruling career, he also made great progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the limitations of the times still remain in Barov’s mind, and that the will is all right if it is written into the law. But the law still has to be enforced by humans, especially in the polity of the local aristocracy and the implementation of centralized power. After all, the greater the power, the bigger the pot to be backed up, and the conflict between the law and the demands of most people. The hidden dangers will sooner or later erupt, and it will not be easy to deal with them at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you?" Roland looked at the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I have some different opinions. Now there are no people in the winter city from all over the gray fort, there will always be various contradictions, if it happens If one item is forbidden, the law will probably become quite bloated. I suggest that it is better to guide them in the direction of the conversation and clearly tell them what is right and what is wrong. It may be more appropriate than all prohibitions."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
