			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company's so-called factory is located in a construction site on the outskirts of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since following the department’s president, Roland naturally didn’t have to drive his little bread to keep on running, but took the opportunity to experience a luxury. The feeling of driving the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that lying in a spacious seat that is softer than a sofa, drinking iced champagne from the rear freezer, this taste is really easy Addictive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it would be perfect to change champagne to cola. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the vehicle drove down a flat road and drove into a pitted temporary road, the roar of the machinery became full, and the trucks and excavators were everywhere. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the row of row houses, you can see the banner hanging "Sanye Construction Engineering Co., Ltd.", further away, towering The pile foundation is dense like a forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably seeing Roland’s curiosity, Guardian explained, “The group intends to build a modern new energy automobile city here, which is currently under the responsibility of the construction department. Construction, when all facilities are completed, will be handed over to the manufacturing department. This project has been approved for a long time and will not be implemented until a few months ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder Recently, Garcia did not mention anything to protest against the demolitions. The relationship was that the Sanye Group temporarily shifted its target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the factory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"will be removed." Guardian replied, "It I used to be a farm machinery factory and experienced several reforms, but I still can't keep up with the times. Considering that your requirements are special, I can leave a factory for you to use - although it does not belong to me. But I have already said hello to it, and it doesn't matter if I put it there for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the manpower still complete?" Roland is more concerned than the venue. It is a professional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s almost gone," Gard shrugged. "There is only one fast-retired master and ten workers. They are all family." People, when the car city is built, the latter is estimated to be transferred to a new position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, it sounds a bit shabby...Roland can’t help it. Abdominal sputum, but there is always better than nothing, although there is still a certain gap with the legendary design bureau that I hope to gather and the experts, but it is finally starting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at the destination, he lowered his psychological expectations again - it was a slightly derelict factory with an area of ​​almost 500. Squared, the surface of the steel plate has been exposed to rust. Walking into the factory, the dust in the corner can almost print the footprints, and the machine tools scattered and scattered are not much better. It is obvious that no one has taken care of them for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Gardner’s stairway to the factory building, near the management room, Roland keenly captured the conversation from the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I don’t know when the company will be here.... Sitting in the same place every day, my ass is getting moldy."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing wrong with being idle. Anyway, if you transfer to a new company, you won't get a salary. Maybe you have to work overtime every day. I would rather sit still." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What to say," a rather old voice came in. "Young people should be full of energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Energy can't be eaten...If I can retire to get a salary now, I promise to agree without saying anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "For Master Xie, you should always retire this time. I heard that the boss has advised you a few times. In fact, even if you don't come to check the card, it is estimated that you won't say anything."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am reluctant to stay here... I have been waiting for thirty years, and now I haven’t dismantled it now. It’s a glance at it.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, I'll shoot a few photos "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"Wait, it seems that someone is coming -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room suddenly sounded a glimpse of the sound of Sosso. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Guardian’s secretary pushed forward the door, everyone in the house had returned to their original position, some sorted out the information on the table, and some sat Knocking and typing in front of the computer, as if you were busy before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jia... Jia, how come you?" Seeing Guardian’s appearance, everyone is one of them, obviously the "boss" in their mouth is not This board member feels like a village that has never been seen before suddenly comes to a high-ranking government official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take a friend to visit," Jiade looked at the oldest person in the crowd. "You are Master Xie, right? I heard that you are here." For decades?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also turned his eyes to each other. From the point of view, he is almost 60 years old, and his hair is only around his head. A sparse circle, a huge reading glasses hung on the nose, thin and thin, holding a color-changing mug in his hand, in addition to the spirit of the eyes, the other places and those in the community There is no difference between the uncles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid that the Master Xie can get the hand, and only the length of service is long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you are right." The other party replied with a cup, with some pleasing meaning in the tone, "from the year of entering the factory, It’s just twenty-nine years this year.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this temperament is also far from the folk masters who have a unique life and look at whoever cares. ... Roland's expectations have fallen to the bottom of the valley, it seems that you may have to recruit yourself online. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really hard for you," Guardian smiled. "Exactly, my young friend is interested in the factory. You will accompany him in a circle. "The situation of the factory building."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good, good." Master Xie looked at Roland with amazement. "But the factory doesn't want to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he is here, the factory will be able to stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this sentence As the road came out, Roland noticed that the other side looked at his own eyes and suddenly got hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you call it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call me Roland."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good Mr. Roland, please come with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xie Shifu happily took him down When the factory area was preparing to introduce the long history of the factory, Roland directly interrupted his words. "I want to know more than what you have done before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost done everything..." Master Xie smiled and said, "From the fitter to the workshop supervisor, and later as a deputy director. When busy, one person must use three or four people. Arrange the running water during the day and teach the boys to repair the machine at night until the eyes are not good enough to make it clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland could not help but stop, "design has also done "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, of course, although I didn't read what was going on, but the factory had an overnight class, I taught myself. There are a lot of West. Just how the pen and ruler can't compare with the computer, and the company set up a special design department in the early years, these paper drawings are estimated to be no one cares."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I want a crawler tractor, and the requirements and specifications on the market are different, can you make it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Tractor? Ha, I am more familiar with it than my wife. I am not bragging, Mr. Roland, just give me some apprentices to get a handle, I can cut it out with my eyes closed."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked with surprise. "In this case, why did the Sanye Group not call you into the design department?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, now they are all inseparable from the computer. I heard that all the production lines of the new factory are automated, robots and robots do most of the work, and the people in the old factory sell all." Going with the administration, even if you ask me to go, I can't do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
