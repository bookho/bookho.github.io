			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rebel nobles were vulnerable to the first army’s offensive, and only a few positive crossfires were won after a round of volleys, even There is no need to replace the nest, the other side has been broken, throwing down a dozen bodies to escape. More often than not, the first army unilaterally pursued and searched. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe used to clean up a piece of territory every day, and successively captured the residence of the elk, the wolf and the wild rose family, but when the troops advanced to the maple leaf territory, the attack The momentum has slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They encountered unexpected troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, this is no different from the fortress," Brian looked at the Earl’s House, standing in front of him, vomiting with a sullen sigh. "There are even moats." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there someone injured in the previous round of attack?" Iron axe asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Injured two hapless, one arrow in the arm, one shot on the back when retreating, but the problem is not big," Brian frowned. "The soldiers are too poor to shoot from the bottom to the roof. Even if there are only arrows and short bows in the other hand, we can't get any benefit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axe knows each other That's right, no one expected that the Earl of Maple actually built his house into a tower form, and it was built on a hill, backed by a rocky cliff. The stream flowing down the desolate mountains was introduced into the dikes more than five meters wide, forming a "small moat" around the mansion. Although it was a living water, it was full of ice floes and snow blocks, but it was not completely frozen. There is only one entrance to the entire tower. To attack the gate, you must cross the arch bridge, which is also the focus of the enemy's marking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shelter around the Earl's House, all of which are flat snow, and the shots occupying the high point make up for the short-range disadvantage of the bow, two rounds of tentative After attacking, the first army only killed three or four people, and several of them were wounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the artillery battalion is here," Brian hated. "A few shots at the door, I don't believe he will not surrender." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately they can't get through, it's too far from the fortress, and the snow is too deep." The iron axe looked up and looked at the sky. "Get here today, Arrange for the soldiers to camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maple Leaf family's fief is located in the northwest of the Long Song Fortress, next to the desolate mountains, and also on the edge of the West. It’s just a short walk, it’s going to take a day’s work, and the snow on the road is not cleaned up. The 12-pound field guns are hard to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information they obtained, the Maple Leaf family had little effort in this rebellion, and even the Earl himself did not appear, which means that the opponent’s strength is almost intact, if All of them are nestled in this fortress-like tower. If there is no siege weapon, it is really difficult to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the night, a campfire was set in the tent of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do tomorrow," Brian added a firewood to the fire pit. "Command the soldiers to rush up with the arrows? As long as they can blow up the damn Iron Gate, their death is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the First Army will also pay ten casualties, the iron axe shook his head, did not answer. If you used to be in Tiesha City, don't say ten people, even if the 100-person guard team gave him the lead, as long as you can complete the task of the patriarch's account, even if you fill it in, you will not hesitate. After arriving in the West, he saw with his own eyes how these soldiers grew to the point where they were today. When they thought of the blood of the Lord Roland, they were reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being silenced for a while, he exhaled, "Come on the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brian groaned, "Looking for them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Axe did not want to do this, he remembered that His Royal Highness had said that a qualified army should be at any All have the ability to complete tasks independently. But now is not the time to compete, in order to achieve the goal of integrating the West within a week, and to minimize casualties, he will not hold on to the inexplicable self-respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Highness also said that the general responsible for the soldier’s life is a good general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
