			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand," Roland lifted her to the waist and gently put it on the bed. The simple movement of light made him panting. Uncovering the thin blanket and turning over the bed, Anna leaned sideways and put her head on his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next should be... foreplay? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found himself nervous, so he couldn’t do it. As an “experienced” person, he couldn’t show up in front of the little girl. Maybe you have to use a light chat to ease the atmosphere, and then do the action, such as ... first talk about a yellow paragraph? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his meditation, Anna’s soft voice rang in his ear: “When you push me on a hot air balloon, I never thought about myself. Will you die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned, I didn’t expect the other person to ask this, "I just did it subconsciously."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the ruler of the Grey Fort and the hope of the witches," she whispered. "I am not worthy of doing this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a question of worthlessness," Roland said with a chuckle. "I can't watch you being attacked and indifferent. In fact, I woke up and thought carefully, if things are not It happened so suddenly, let me have time to think about it and then make a decision. I will still do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't stop you, right?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, no." Roland squeezed her nose with the other hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna’s eyelashes fell down, and after a moment of silence, I said, “Can you tell me about your previous story... I want to know more. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, used to," Roland spit out, he searched the memory of the next four princes, and was preparing to talk about the two kings of the fun, but the words The mouth swallowed back. His past does not belong here, but another very different world. "I used to live in a big city, very big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, The gray castle king capital is much bigger than the border town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was born and ordinary people are no different, some smart, but not smart Where to go. Learning is hard work, so I am often praised by the teacher, but he does not know that the graffiti on the classroom wall is hard to erase."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "He certainly can't blame you." Anna whispered softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, that's not, he doesn't need to be like me, just tell my parents," Roland smiled and shook his head. "That When they taught me, they would never leave their hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then, as I grow older, my teacher keeps changing, from junior teachers to The tutor, in the end, completed all the studies with good or bad grades. Of course, compared to the children of other people, after all, it is a bad one..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Half-closed eyes, slowly revealing his own experience, this kind of unobtrusive, unscrupulous communication experience has not been experienced for a long time. Since he came here, he has always played the role of a prince. At this moment, he feels that he has returned to the past, as if he is lying in a hotel full of classical style, and he is very familiar with the Chinese girl. Also gradually relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the next step? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland turned slightly, only to find that Anna had closed her eyes, and the chest on her side was slightly ups and downs, and fell asleep like a cat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave a slight glimpse, and then could not help but laugh out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that...she is also tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking too, in order to conceal the whereabouts, the witches found the place in the mountains the night before, and they must be guarded against the beasts and the devils, almost one I didn't sleep at night, and when it was just lit up, I continued to raise the distance to the side of the town. After returning to the castle, Anna spent the night in her bedroom. There was no rest for two days and two nights. It was easy to let the tiredness of the previous depression burst out when it was tight and loose. Now it’s not tired. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
