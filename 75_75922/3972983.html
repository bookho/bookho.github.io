			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, the road to the palace has been cleared, the city is yours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The iron axe was in front of Roland, and he looked excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle lasted from yesterday until today morning. After breaking the city gate, the first army completed two major operational targets in just two hours - capturing Inner City Palace and Eastern Cathedral. The next step is to clear the enemy and completely extinguish Tiefko’s resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked around and found that everyone had the same excitement on his face. Whether it was the First Army or the Witch, the high spirits were about to overflow. If they haven't expressed their feelings yet, they may have already cheered up. After Tefko was overthrown, even if he did not carry out the ceremony, he has become the king of the gray castle in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his mood was unexpectedly calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "grand capital" that represents the center of the Grey Fortress does not resonate with him. He does not feel like returning to his homeland. In the eyes of Roland, this It is just an ordinary city. The development priority is not as good as the long song fortress. The only meaning is that... the king has finally finished the farce, and he can safely operate his own territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, victory is a victory, especially a hearty victory. It is believed that the news of Wang Duyi will soon spread throughout the kingdom. His prestige and fame will be on a new level, which will be of great benefit to the next recruitment of talents and the promotion of reform. At this point, more than half of the spring offensive plan has been completed, and now only the South is left... Roland involuntarily casts his sights on the direction of the Dragon Ridge and the far south. That is where you really need to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and interrupted his thoughts, screaming, "We are going into the city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, Your Majesty," the iron axe stood up respectfully, looking forward to the left-behind soldiers who had long waited for the road. "Two-way column, protect your new king, set off!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers raised their weapons and shouted, "Long live the king of Wimbledon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the King! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the cheers of the First Army, Roland walked down the warship and headed for the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the gates, the streets are cold and clear, and almost no figures are visible. The ground still has traces after the war, the closer it is to the direction of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner city can see broken houses, uncleaned roadblocks, broken limbs and spotted blood everywhere. There is no doubt that the process of capturing the palace is short-lived, but it is still the most intense battle that the First Army has experienced since its establishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the wreckage on both sides of the street, Roland couldn’t help feeling a little distressed. The number of specific casualties is still not counted, but the first army sent to the rear has shown More than 20 people, this is the result of the timely rescue of Nana Va. If there is no help from the little girl, this number will at least triple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping into the palace area, the soldiers stationed there are kneeling down on one knee, and the road leading to the palace is neatly full of two rows - this is The first army where military rituals have become popular is very rare. Roland did not say anything to stop it. From their exhilarating expressions, it can be seen that these people did not greet themselves as a member of the army at the moment, but to pay tribute to the new king as the members of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the green garden, the scene in memory instantly coincides with everything around it - three bluestone buildings are arranged triangularly around the water garden The territory where the Wimbledon family lived for generations. On the left is the palace for banquets or ceremonies, but now it has been destroyed by a bomb, leaving only a few ten-strong pillars standing on the sky; on the right is the city hall and the library, which is currently being watched by the First Army. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle is the most magnificent twin tower temple, its structure is similar to the high-rise buildings of the later generation, the bottom is the oval three-story podium, the area ratio The Bianque Town Castle District is still large; there are a raised tower on each side of the podium, one tower is built into a crown shape, and the other is a rear crown, symbolizing the supremacy of the Grey Castle royal family. In the center of the two towers, two crossed iron cables are diagonally pulled to represent the double-gun pattern on the family emblem. No matter from the styling or design concept, it is an outstanding work that can be passed down to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
