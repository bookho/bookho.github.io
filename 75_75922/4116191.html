			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No northwest of the winter city, hide the forest hinterland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snakes feel that after joining the railway engineering team, this one and a half months is the most incredible time in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No...He thought, it might not be appropriate to describe it in the most, because every once in a while, he always sees incredible things - just like him I have never really met the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth finally understands why the workers who come here must sign a confidentiality agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement requires them not to pass on the vision they see, whether it is oral or recorded, which is a violation of the laws of the kingdom, but a fine, confiscated income. In addition, it will be distributed to the North Slope Mine and forced labor. And the agreement also stressed that those who are unwilling to comply can withdraw from the engineering team, but there is no chance of being lucky. The person in charge of the inspection is the Kingdom Security Bureau. No one can escape the ubiquitous French Open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Snake has never thought of this, and the written record has the possibility of being caught. How can the dictation be done without fail? If you arrest one if you report one, then the project will not be implemented. But now, he has a very different view. The secrets of the winter city under the control of His Majesty are probably far more than his imagination. In most places that people can’t see, it’s likely to be surging. Amazing power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who impressed him the most was the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White paper is also a witch, but in his eyes has always been the object of protection. When the church propaganda witch is an evil person who inherited the power of the devil, he did not pay attention to it. If they are so powerful, why are they being hunted by the church, and they don’t even dare to show up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this concept was broken by a witch named Yeh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth never thought about it, and someone could control the entire jungle with one's own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The engineering team entered the area as if it were not a hidden forest, but the belly of a wild beast - this is especially evident when laying the railway. The vines form a continuous net over the roadbed, and a rail is wrapped and dragged forward, and then falls to the ground after the designated location, like the fruit on the vine. Where the railway was repaired, the trees on both sides were separated by themselves, and even the deforestation was saved. At the same time, the surrounding canopy will grow particularly dense, covering the sky as a whole, so as not to cause the devil's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the forest can actively attack the beasts that are close to the engineering team. If they can get a bowl of fresh broth one day, then it must be A beast that does not open his eyes breaks into the territory of the leaf adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth had the privilege of witnessing the other side, but he was not sure whether the leaf adult was still human. She showed a strange green color all over her body, which looked like a gem. And acting as if there is no entity, you can walk freely between the branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was before him, he would be scared to scream out loudly--this kind of ghostly walk and incredible appearance, being defiled into a devil's minions Not surprisingly, the only thought in his mind at the time was: Fortunately, white paper is not like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the snakes don’t hate each other at all, and even feel the sincere reverence. Because His Majesty once said at the ceremony, he was able to let everyone in the Winter City have a full meal, relying on the help of the witch leaves. Everyone who is freed from hunger and hardship is the beneficiary of her ability. With this feat alone, the leaves should be remembered forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth is naturally one of the beneficiaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the witch, another discovery is probably his personal secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was after the First Army entered the fascinating forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the devil attacked the Winter City, the voice of counterattack has become more and more fierce. Even in the wild, the workers are also discussing this issue. He was not surprised by the arrival of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of soldiers go to the front line every day. Obviously, His Majesty is planning to move the real thing. Unlike the knights he had seen before, the soldiers who went out were mostly acquaintances in the neighborhood. They were not familiar with this, but they were familiar with them. Therefore, every time there is an army, the workers will always welcome and the scene is not lively. . I thought that it would be a cold and dangerous chore to stay away from the border to repair the railway. I didn’t expect it to be the case at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
