			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles who can enter the castle conference hall are basically supporters of the three major families of Huiguang City, many of whom are also involved in the construction of the north and south artery. The introduction of steam engines and the production of calcined cement made a big deal; I went to the town of Thorns and witnessed the training of the Cavaliers at close range. The King of the Grey Fort was so confident that the anxiety on the faces of the people finally disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, this open and honest meeting of data and details is definitely a rare experience for the morning princes, compared to drawing a pie or False words of comfort, precise discussion is inherently more convincing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... what do we need to do?" someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Keep the status quo," Roland said bluntly. "A stable morning is the greatest help for the war."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But now the panic has begun to spread. If coercive measures are taken, it may only be counterproductive to the group of refugees..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "That's because the devil used the red fog to invade the border territory, and this situation will not always worsen." Roland said comfortably. "The Grey Fort will also do everything in its power to help you stabilize the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where the territory threatened by the devil, Wang Du will also be exempted from the tribute and will be subsidized as appropriate." Hofford added in time, "You, this is a fate for everyone." In the war, no one can stay out of the way. I am swearing in the name of the ancestors, no matter what the outcome, I will never leave the Glow City step! If the morning sun is destroyed by the devil, then this castle is me. Grave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the aristocrat who was guaranteed and slightly relieved to leave the hall, the meeting quickly entered the second part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still in the room, except for the morning lord, the rest are the gray castle high-rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I am willing to take full responsibility for the previous sniper war." Iron Axe and Itis stood up at the same time, surprised. I looked at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of offensive means God has made, no one can expect it," Roland shook his head. "Don't tell me, when you started making plans." Never considered the situation in which the reserve team was attacked or even destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The two can only choose silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team conducts temptations, and multiple teams move according to the situation. This is a routine move in the development of tactics, but self-righteous thinking that the loss will only occur in the squad That is the stupid idea. He believes that the staff will not make such a low mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, the moment you decide to put the plan into practice, the default is that the plan is more meaningful than the two units need to take. Risk. Otherwise, from the beginning, this program should not be passed. Rest assured, I will not use the number of casualties to measure your merits, even if it is indeed the biggest loss of the First Army."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"陛下..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But don't forget," said Roland, who took back the ease The self-contained look and tone have become dignified. "These soldiers also have their own family. Don't treat their sacrifices as a piece of paper. I hope that you will keep this in mind every time you make an action."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow, squat." Iron Axe and Itis sing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So let’s talk about your views on the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes "Northland Pearl has been replaced by a new map." After analysis, the staff said that there are two places where the most important place to go after the floating fortress is turned. One is the border of the mountain and the other is the Hermes Plateau. The former can ensure that the wolf heart is won and threaten the morning kingdom; the latter can make the red mist invade the four countries at the same time, making the desolate mountain a channel connected to the continental spine. But now it has crossed the border of the morning, according to the trajectory Look, in all likelihood, it’s going to Hermes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
