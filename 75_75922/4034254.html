			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is simply...day penalty," the iron axe exclaimed. "Even the shadows of the opponents are not seen, only passive beatings, if it is ordinary It is absolutely impossible for the enemy to walk through the mountain road with gunfire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first commander of the army has seen the power of the howitzer, naturally knowing that it is intensive What an amazing effect will happen in the team. From the first cannonball landing to the front of the position, there are five kilometers away. The enemy will either rush all the way, consume the strength before the war, or continue to advance regardless of the disregard, dragging the incomplete team to attack the position. Of course, the most likely situation is still scattered, and the march directly turns to flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the enemies we have to deal with are not ordinary," Roland smiled. "And the number of shells is very limited, otherwise the two fortresses alone You can all smash your opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress gun has a firing rate of up to eight rounds per minute due to the use of self-propelled ammunition, and the firepower delivery efficiency is absolutely absolute in this era. Said to be mad. Since the Wangdu Alchemist moved to the No Winter City with a large number of apprentices, the output of the double-base propellant has risen steadily, and the number of shells has become the biggest limit. The trigger fuze can only be produced by Anna by hand. The mechanical structure limits the production capacity of the howitzer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your squad, all the twenty correction guns have been fired," after repeating several shots, the battalion commander Fan Nahui reported that "a total of six effective targets were obtained." The data is generally distributed in the second half of the mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, come here today." Roland nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the test shells also need special production, although the solid warheads are used, but the shape and weight are the same as the grenade mounted on the fuze - this exquisite work is also Only Anna can do it, and every day she will take time to make a certain number of test warheads for the artillery camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still need to go somewhere else?" asked the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Roland thought for a moment and shook his head. "I will go back to the camp first, and you will continue to train the soldiers."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the camp, Roland grew a sigh of relief on the lounge chair and he found that he had not much to do, or that he had done When you're done, the rest is only resigned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days ago, the church finally reacted. According to Mai Yi’s return, the gates of the holy city opened wide, and countless people poured out from the city. A neat long queue headed for the cold wind ridge. The armor of the warriors flashed silver, overlooking the sky, like a sparkling river running through the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the spies placed in the old holy city and the Hermes Plateau also sent back a secret letter, saying that the church’s action scale was unprecedented, even in the city. There are a lot of people in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the enemy has come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland, who got the news, immediately rushed to the front line, and his arrival also brought the morale of the First Army officers to the top, a decision on the future of both sides. The big battle is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 4,000 elite soldiers, a preliminary investigation team composed of the preparatory knights, lightning and wheat, provided by the Duke of the North, Silvi does not leave a dead end The firepower guidelines, as well as the fighting witches distributed around the camp, are not complete. Even the church's actions are carried out step by step in accordance with the operational plan formulated by the General Staff. Moreover, the residents of the Cold Wind Ridge have all been evacuated. Even if the other party wants to use the maddening pills, they can only consume the believers in the Holy City, or Other kingdoms forced residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opening is considered to be perfect enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is always a bit of worry in Roland’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of form they will appear, and what kind of ability will interfere with the decisive battle, are unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid casualties caused by sneak attacks, the witches who stayed on the front line these days were sleeping in clothes and all concentrated in one lobby. Sylvie and the Nightingale are divided into two groups of alternate vigils. As soon as the magical reaction is discovered, the entire camp will be awakened by the echo of the echo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
