			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is full of happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to have returned to the battlefield four hundred years ago, killing blood with the enemy. Only this time, she does not have to worry about the pain after the failure, without watching her friends dying in her arms, and there is no heavy responsibility for the task that is overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best part is that both the devil and herself can feel the pain of the blade in the killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With pain, you have real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Female...I have to say that you did a good job," Cabradaby threw a bloody arm on the floor, "although still not out of the reptile species." The scope, but it has been much stronger than most of yours. I really didn't pick the wrong person, your performance made me happy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Zoe?” Zoe smacked and vomited a piece of minced meat. “It’s a pity that your meat is too hard to eat.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This is the fifth day after the start of the battle... or the seventh day? She does not have the ability to estimate time without the help of the sun, moon and stars, and can only roughly estimate the date based on the natural reaction of the body. The time here should be fixed in a cycle, such as thirst and hunger will suddenly disappear when it gradually becomes obvious, returning to the original state. If you think of it as a day, it would be reasonable, otherwise you won't be able to play for a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain that came from the broken arm - obviously this is not a fair contest, the other party can use the magic to condense the sword, and she can rely on Only two fists and two feet, plus a tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Zoe doesn't care about fairness at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because winning or losing is not the point at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pursuit of the battlefield is to kill the enemy and preserve itself, but not here. The broken limbs will reunite in the dark, and no matter how many injuries are suffered, they will not lose consciousness. Without death, pain will become eternal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And creating pain does not have to be done with a sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She noticed that this was the first time since the start of the war that the other party took the initiative to slow down the rhythm and speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But your insistence doesn't make sense," the high-order devil held the injured shoulder, and the bloody wound quickly recovered. "An attack like this, even The fur is not worth it. If you want to beat me with your teeth, I am afraid I will be disappointed - I will break your teeth a little bit later, then stuff them into your stomach and get ready!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you still feel pain, don't you?" Zoe gasped and watched his arm gradually recover. "Right, I want to ask more." Is that pain familiar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Female, what do you mean by this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;No, be patient, don't let it see your intoxication, it will make fun less -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this thought, she still bears I can't help but chuckle. "When you are half dead, you should feel it every day..." She pointed to the position of the shoulder blade. "Puncture from here, Cut a piece of meat on the ground, according to the frequency of your body shaking at the time, it should not be too good. Ah, I seem to forget to introduce, that person who cares for you along the way is me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bug-!" Cabrada was so angry that he suddenly snarled and raised his sword. "I want to crush you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 16th day, or longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark ground is already full of blood, mostly reddish-brown, and a small half of the blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is equivalent to a short hammer, while the latter can be used as a stab. As long as it does not touch the front of the magic weapon, the two are quite easy to wield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four hundred years is enough to turn them into experts who are proficient in all kinds of weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her favorite offensive part is still the shoulder of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain, sometimes even irrespective of the size of the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are tired, take a break now," Zoe hung his spine around his waist and acted with some numb wrists. "After all, you I have to torture me for a long time, and I will be able to make it more enjoyable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The devil did not respond for the first time, its chest was ups and downs, scarlet eyes Staring at the extraordinary witch, the seemingly inhuman face has lost its initial contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the two has not reversed, the high-level devil's multiple abilities ensure its superior position in the battle, Zoe often needs to pay several times The price can be hit hard by the opponent. Once there is a mistake, it will suffer for a long time. It is common for a person to cut off his fingers and open his mouth. However, the atmosphere is gradually different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the silence of the other party, Zoe did not care. "I said... Is this the space you created?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably it takes a short break, Cabrada is slowly opening. "This is a stream of consciousness, a combination of magic and soul, and no one needs to create. Like you Such reptiles are hard to understand. There is a chance to enter the stream of consciousness, and there is no one in the world--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen bigger "It's as complete as a world," she interrupted. "Someone has a tree, and there is nothing like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't laugh ", female!" The devil whispered. "You don't know how much magic it takes to build an entity in the stream of consciousness, let alone the complete world! The only source of magic can do this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the source of magic...the same as the realm of the gods, it’s just an illusory concept, and I don’t know where it is. You seem really seen as right. "Zoe remove the spine, back in hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is all information engraved in the inheritance, and only you can know nothing about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you can talk about it in detail and use the evidence to convince me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Female, do you think I am a fool? "Cablada is more than thunderous." "This inferior cliché, how can I be a Cabrada than an adult?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is not falling, one The rod "spears" pierced its head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white swaying spear is the spine that Zoe held before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't want to say it, then the rest time will end here. When you want to say it, it's not too late to rest." She took the leg bones straight up The swaying opponent rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first... dozens of days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why," Cabradabi has completely lost his initial momentum, and it keeps the sword of magic on his chest, as if looking at the monster Zoe, "Don't you be afraid of pain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the war four hundred years ago made me get used to this feeling, four hundred years After the sinking, I forgot about it - if there is something that is often with you, you will be afraid of it?" Zoe raised his mouth, and at this moment, she no longer has to hide herself, "actually I have to thank you. The experience that Roland can't give is compensated from you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...the madman!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a short moment compared to hundreds of years - now it’s your turn to please me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
