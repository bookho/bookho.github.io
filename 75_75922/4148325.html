			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an abandoned house in Broken Fort, Trent was looking through the observation hole to look at the situation in the city. Due to the influence of the terrain difference, he could only see a small area of ​​the gate of the city - there will be the checkpoints that they will take the first time after the battle started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sniper action, Mo Jinren will be the first to take the lead in the assault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an opportunity for Brian to deliberately treat them as consumables, but rather to fight for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proving yourself by force and using merits in exchange for resources is the norm in the very south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takda comes from an unremarkable small tribe in the oasis. When the Yinchuan Oasis fades a little, his clan is on the verge of life and death. If not, he was then Nor will it take great risks to deal with the northerners. But now, everyone in the family has moved safely to the clear water port—the land of eternal green that they had dreamed of, and this is the reward for his return to the Grand Chief and the Rage and the Bone Clan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the idea of ​​asking for the initiative to fight is very simple, killing more enemies, in order to make the tribes live better. As for who the enemy is, it doesn't matter. Even the devil from hell will not be more terrible than hunger, thirst, and panic that may not be seen at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that most of the sand people who come here are the same as he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you find?" asked someone behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, except that the red fog is getting thicker, nothing else can be seen." Minda slammed the hole and went back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrogator is the smallest scorpion in the team. The gun behind him is almost longer than his torso, with a deep scar on his face from the forehead. It extends all the way to the corner of his mouth and looks very uncomfortable with his young facial features. For this person, Yuda’s impression is quite deep. Although the other party seems to be young, the quality of training and actual combat is different from ordinary people. Even those experienced and famous warriors may not be able to win. he. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to say that such a person cannot be unknown in a small oasis, but the fact is that Tat has never heard of such a person before. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have been waiting for two weeks?" Feuer complained. "Hundreds of people in such a place can be crazy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brian is not talking about it, the devil has a flying beast, and wants to not attract the attention of the enemy, we can only ambush in advance." Some surprised, "Did you not participate in hunting rituals? In order to hunt a sand worm, it is normal to lurk in the bush for the first half of the month. What problems can you have more time now?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan, the iron axe has mobilized about 2,000 people to be scattered in the northern block of the city of Dustburg, and arranged a reserve of 1,000 people in the inner city of the south. force. The hiding place has already been sorted out, and the surface looks like a ruin. The interior has built a simple shelter. The upper floor is used for investigation, and the lower floor is housed. Not only water and food are prepared, but even sleeping and excreting places are made. Distinguish. Although it is impossible to completely isolate the taste, it is a relatively relaxed environment compared to hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t quite understand why the other party suddenly complains about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...do not understand." The law and the words stopped, and finally glanced at him with a sigh of relief, sitting down against the wall. "You said what kind of iron cans they had prepared before? It was used to dig holes and embedding the thread. As a result, the enemy came over, but there was no movement at all."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know...but if the Big Chief is screaming, I don't think it's strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All kinds of incredible Supplies, tools and weapons, he has seen too much in the past year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope it won't be the next mad pill." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing Pills? He seems to have heard of this stuff... Heda just wanted to ask the other person, and suddenly someone came out from the floor. "The news came from the rear, the attack will start soon, you have to prepare quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
