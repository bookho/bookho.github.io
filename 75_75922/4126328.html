			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carnival of the throne ceremony has continued from noon to night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than ten huge pots on the central square, which are filled with fragrant fresh soup, boiled under the water, various kinds of seasonings and oil flowers Stacked on the side of the pot, full of a finger thick. Anyone can put food into it, cook it and then fish it out – in the case that most spices are still luxury, this banquet is obviously attractive to them. Some people even brought earthen jars and wooden barrels, hoping to bring this rich oil soup home and slowly taste it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the City Hall will continue to add new soups and bases - when a chopped beef bone and sausage are poured into the pot At the time, there will be a burst of cheers in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a scene that I dare not imagine in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long winter makes people take care of the heat, and the passing of each body temperature means further death. But now, they can scream and vent their enthusiasm in the falling snow without having to worry about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they know that these energy and temperature can be added back at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to deliberately guide, people spontaneously lift the hot food in the direction of the castle, and offer blessings and praises to the new king's ascension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi regained his gaze and moved his gaze back into the castle hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet here is equally lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wine, food, music, laughter have everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Roland and Anna came together in a new dress, it caused even more horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilvi is the first time to see a wedding dress of this style - very different from the white yarn on the chief knight’s wedding, if the former is still a bit late The shadow of the dress, the latter is like a new design by Roland. The color of the clothes is mainly red and gold. It has long cuffs and skirts. The shoulders are covered with two patterned ribbons, which are complicated and luxurious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, such a bright dress is easy to overwhelm the owner's own appearance, but wearing it on Anna is just right - she is the master of the flame itself With that strong comprehension ability, even in the witch group is a dazzling one, and the bright red color reflects this; with the generous design of the clothes, she has a more dignified and calm feeling. It is suitable for the identity of the queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has toasted the two, and Roland and Anna responded with a smile. It can be said that this is a perfect dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Hillvi could not relax at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she saw some strange signs in the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the owner of the Eye of Magic, she always acts as the first line of defense for the warning circle, providing timely warnings for subsequent guards. At this critical time of the throne ceremony, it is necessary to strive for absolute security. Whether it is out of its own ideas or the relationship with His Royal Highness, she hopes that Roland can be safe and sound, so naturally she will not let go of these clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every single sign is not a matter of concern, but together, it forms an intriguing puzzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Hilvi think of a song that Roland occasionally sang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lyrics explained by the other party are quite interesting - what a black cane, a subtle floral scent, and many seemingly inconsistencies, eventually lead A truth that was deliberately buried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, this song has become the group song of the detective group after being heard by the mystery month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation at the time seemed to be the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Hilli still has silence at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she suddenly remembered what Anna had said to herself two days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People who can prevent secrets from revealing can often only be done by people who know the secrets - at this point, I need your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, she did not really understand the meaning of the words, so she was not too concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until today, she suddenly understood it - this sentence is like the last stroke of the puzzle, when it is clicked, the whole picture has meaning . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glimpsed a secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This did not make Sylvie feel happy, but felt a lot of pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she now needs to not only keep this secret, but also to prevent others from discovering the secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scattered and strange signs are likely to be more than just noticed by her alone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi swept the entire hall, focusing on the three targets -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Auntie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia licked his nose and his face showed a suspicious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?" Andrea on the side joked, "Is the wolf also infected with the cold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if there is a problem with the nose. I have always had such an illusion in the morning," Luo Jia sniffed to the left and right. "The smell in the hall seems to be a little wrong..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't count?" Ashes interjected, "Can you identify the taste of each person and then match it with the sender?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as they are not too far apart, or are disturbed by strong odors," Luo Jia nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are nearly a hundred people in the hall now," Andrea apparently did not believe. "Even if the nose is more sensitive, it is impossible to remember so much taste at the same time." What's more, many people use perfume and physical contact, just like this -" she said, she touched the back of the extraordinary witch with the hand that had just caught the chicken leg. "I will also get pregnant with her." The strange smell, can you tell the difference?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really hard...but it's one thing to know exactly, there is no taste is another It’s a thing.” Luo Jia lowered his ears inexplicably. “It’s obvious that everyone is standing in one place and not moving. Why are there some flavors that will be intermittent?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Cough," the voice of Sylvie suddenly sounded behind the three men. "This should be ill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silvi? Andrea picked her eyebrows. "How come you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I walked around and just heard your conversation." Shrugging and looking at the wolf woman, "The climate in the west is different from the desert in the south. It is very easy to be eroded by the cold. Moreover, this is the first winter when you come here. It is normal to not adapt. If you feel that your nose is not smooth, go It’s good to find Lily for a cup of purified water. I used to do this when I first came.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is it?” Luo Jia said, “I I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After leaving the trio, Hillvi was relieved a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia. Because of its ability, the burning fire has far more than the average person's hearing and smell, plus the beast-like insight, which belongs to the whole target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, they have just stopped their further close to the secret trail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second key goal is -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕咕,咕,咕咕咕Hey...hey!" The cockroach on the top of the lightning bolt was excited to say something to Joan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
