			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say!?" The Lord of the Morning screamed and pushed the singer in his arms and stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who was covered in pink silk and looming in her body fell to the ground, apparently not falling, but she was afraid to send out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the servants, monks, and jugglers also bowed their heads in fear, and the entire palace hall suddenly became silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty..." The reporting minister swallowed, "Your predecessor, rebellious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you are rebelling, not wanting to pay for the idiots outside?" Anpein didn't know if he should doubt his ears, or the staff was too low, exaggerating the watcher's words ten times. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not unclear about the plans of those aristocrats in the field - but those who come back from Hermes have basically seen the destruction of the Knights of the Kings. And the appearance of his embarrassment when he fled. At this time, I still hope that they are still loyal to the royal family, and it is too naive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a normal change, the gang is also normal, and the three major families of Wangdu are obviously their first choice. Anpein was wary of this, but he thought that according to the temperament of the three old ministers, in all likelihood, he would be safe and close. After all, the king is still in his hands, and any act that annoys him is tantamount to finding his own way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the first problem was actually the Quine family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collusion with the foreign lord has already violated his majesty, perhaps the old count just wants to leave a back road, or affirm his position...but whatever the reason For such offenses, punishment is inevitable. It’s like Otto Losey – he didn’t kill this childhood friend on the spot, it’s enough restraint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can... What does it mean to rebel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Quinn is in the city of Glow, neither the people nor the soldiers, relying on the dozens of guards around him? Don't laugh at the big teeth, why should he rebel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl of the Great, he did have contact with the foreign aristocrats, no, but not privately, but sent an invitation!" The Minister wiped the sweat on his forehead. "He publicly invited all nobles to go to the mansion and persuaded them to work for the Quinn family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ampe was stunned and could hardly understand what he had heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move can indeed be linked to the rebellion, but the way is too ridiculous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not from the aristocrats in the field to find helpers, but to make them loyal to Quinn – does Horford really know what he is doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has become a dangerous ship that can be overturned at any time, how could a nobleman agree to this proposal! This practice is undoubtedly a two-faced enemy. The Moya royal family will never tolerate such a serious provocation, and the stupidity of not seeing the situation will only make those nobles scorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, was the former Prime Minister such a arrogant person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No words for a while, Anpein said, "Call me to order, let the patrol's commander, Sir Bakaf, lead the team and go to Earl's Court. Horford Quin came to see me. Other people in the house were temporarily put in prison and watched. If there is a blocker, they can kill on the spot! I would like to see if he has any explanation for this." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, squat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being out of this news, he has no fun After a happy mood, after driving away all the people in the hall, Anpe could not help but lean on the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not simply looking for fun, but once the surroundings are quiet, his ears will continue to ring the roar of the skyfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war more than a month ago left an indelible impression on his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... It was not a war, but a unilateral massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is a knight or a serf, there is no difference in the face of the gray castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Wang Du, An Pei found that he no longer had the courage to confront Roland - the frustration brought to him by his defeat, even more than his father's death Still heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even more desperate is that he knows that the Moya family has lost the entire morning kingdom. What is it that offends a neighboring country with a strong power? There is no doubt that the other party will sooner or later annex the territory he inherited from his father, but he is helpless! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was full of ambitions when he was enthroned, and he wanted to manage this kingdom so that the people can live a stable life without worrying about witches and evil beasts. Equal threats. As a result, he was only a short-term one. He was already in a state of sorrow. He was not interested in politics and commerce. He only waited for the enemy's army and then hanged him on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the thought of this, Anpe’s hatred against the king of the Grey Fortress is increasing day by day, and I can’t wait to eat raw meat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Roland Wimbledon, he should have been famous for his history and become a generation of Mingjun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is the fault of the other party - the new king of the Grey Fort has been confused by the witch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed the armrests, and the fire of his heart was nowhere to vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you grab the count of Quinn, you must let him taste it, what is the anger of the king! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, by the afternoon, his newly appointed minister ran into the palace in a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, Sir Bakaf is dead! The patrol...the whole army is over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What? -!" The Lord of the Morning Stunnedly grabbed the collar of the other party. "Did they bury a trap around the mansion? Or are they hiding the guards in the mansion?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it is hiding the guards," the minister replied quickly. "I saw it with my own eyes! Bakaf first asked the Earl to come out. After being rejected, he went straight into the house to catch people, but very It was almost killed by his guards. Not only that, but they also rushed out of the courtyard and tore with the patrols surrounding the mansion - the group was mad, with weapons in their hands, deboning Knives, sticks, and even bricks... In less than a quarter of an hour, the team is broken!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people do they have?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably... seven or eight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Budget!" Anpei licked each other On the ground, "seven people are also Calling Tibet? Even if it is a businessman in Huiguang City, you can get a dozen of guards. Are you scared and stupid! And how are the patrols one or two hundred people broken up by seven or eight guards? Even if it is Two hundred wild boars don’t lose so fast—is they not even as good as the pigs on the hunting ground!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your Majesty, those people... It’s not a human being, it’s a monster,” the minister said with a sad face. “Most of the patrols can’t even stop them. It’s not the power and speed that people have!”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anpein’s heart trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This description seems to have been seen there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he remembered, killing his father’s murderer, the two church witches who claimed to be pure, and showed him the terrorist force of the gods . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it... the Count of Quinn colluded with the church? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unstoppable anger suddenly rises from his heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Riesus!" Anpein shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a knight who walked in quickly outside the hall and shouted to him on one knee. "What is your command?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Recently summon all mercenaries in the Glow City, bring heavy shackles and rockets, and burn me to the grounds of Count Quinn!" He shouted, "Whether they are humans or monsters I want them all to be turned into fly ash!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
