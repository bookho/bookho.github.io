			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf heart, Wang Duo fang city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great city that has been ransacked by the church has not recovered its strength so far, standing at the highest point of the castle, you can see that many streets and lanes in the outer city have become The ruins. But it is a lot more fortunate than the Badger, which has been poisoned by evil. At least, like the latter, it is still possible to see corrupt piles of corpses in wells or drains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, it was the territory of the royal family of the royal family. The iron axe also adhered to the principle of evacuating small towns and villages and finally dealing with the nobility. I did not pay attention to the struggle between the fangs and the Token and Redstone Gates, but the sudden appearance of the red fog made him have to make adjustments. After all, even if the city of fangs is lost again, it is also the hub city with one of the best wolves, and it is also connected to the north and south main roads, so that the team that has withdrawn from the Yongdong land can enter the safe zone smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no place worth mentioning in the battle process. Even if there is no support from the fortress, the five teams that he temporarily mobilized will total 500 people. The mortars and anti-devil grenade knocked on the stalwart, which is known as the jewel, and the walled city of the fangs. His city owner, Hebrak, was named by the precise shooter when he was in the front, and the final counterattack was declared unresolved, and the remaining nobles surrendered. One of the three major forces of the wolf was destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first person to follow Roland’s military from the beginning of the first battle in Bianbu Town, the iron axe is the clearest cognition of the speed of no winter strength, five Years ago, they were still playing back with the Duke of Long Song, but now, as long as they are willing, the First Army will not be a problem if they penetrate any kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that their growth has been far from others, and those nobles are no longer on one level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not make him feel a little relaxed or complacent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more disparity the difference is, the more he knows the overall gap between humans and demons, how amazing it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the devil with red fog support, the first army can hardly stand firm in the winter, and every day there will be troops retreating back to the wolf, and the casualty report will not Interrupted. In the absence of a permanent defense line, the enemy's rushing and chasing ability makes the detachments invincible, and there are intelligences that the other party suddenly appears on the way to the retreat of the personnel - and it has been repeatedly investigated to confirm the safety. It’s correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passive beating situation will undoubtedly have a negative impact on morale. The easiest way to deal with this is to immediately transfer all the staff back to the cage area, but the iron axe Clearly, orders and tasks are above all else. Since the population needs a population, he cannot retire all the troops because of concerns about casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only remaining counter-attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use all your strength to clench your fists and beat them on the face of the devil! Only in this way can their unscrupulous pursuit be suspended, and the evacuation troops can be exported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the block he chose was the city of Tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil's defense seems to be weakening." Brian held a look at the mirror. Since his squad began to mobilize his troops, he rushed to the sinking bay with the first fleet from the extreme south, and together with him, there were 1,500 Mojin warriors. This is also the first Shamin army recruited in the form of an integrated form in the history of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting from the Yongdong border." The iron axe nodded. "Itis is right. The devil built the obelisk on the ridge of the continent." It is a double-edged sword. It is hidden, but it also hinders them from going south."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the apex of the castle tower, looking north, you can see the heavens and the earth. That bloody cloud. That is the red mist that is constantly spreading. Now it has crossed the dividing line between the winter and the wolf heart, and it is slowly pressing against the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city below the cloud is the golden water town of the wolf heart - it has been covered by the red mist, but still has not found "fortress-type beast" Traces. The fearful beasts hovering in the sky are also pitiful, as if they have been forgotten by the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is placed at the beginning of the red fog, this is almost impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this period of time, the staff has had a general understanding of the devil's action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
