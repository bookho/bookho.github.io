			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week of busyness, Roland built a new chemical plant next to the Chishui River. Considering the toxicity of nitrogen oxides, the factory looks like In the convenience market, the wall and the wooden ceiling are not closed. There is a gap of about one floor in the middle, and the ventilation is excellent. Of course, the temperature is no different from the outdoor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new oxygen and nitrogen synthesis unit has begun trial operation. The high temperature and arc generated by the black fire are no different, and the efficiency is higher than the arc when interlaced into a mesh. After the reactor of nearly two meters high is filled with the raw materials in proportion, Anna only needs half a quarter of an hour to convert it into nitrogen dioxide, which is nitric acid in the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nitrogen and hydrogen synthesis ammonia equipment is also intensive production - the liquid nitrogen output due to cooling is much larger than liquid oxygen, so this part is more Nitrogen can be used to make ammonia. Roland naturally does not leave the conventional industrial process of nitric acid. According to the two-legged walking scheme, each additional nitric acid production line can provide him with more chemical explosives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the test of white paper ability, she found that she can accelerate the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen under heating, and the speed is as fast as skipping the process, directly The results are average. The downside is that it still can't control the magic release very well, plus it is not yet adult, so the magic that is not much is quickly consumed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this shortcoming can be improved through continuous practice. According to Wendy, the little girl’s progress is very fast, and almost one week later, she will be able to The effect is basically maintained at a fixed level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these two production lines, coupled with stable nitrification* glycerol production, smoke-free gunpowders that are close to modern levels have also landed. The next step is to design a brand new firearm and put it into production as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is thinking about the next weapon selection, and the guards walked into the office and reported to him, "Mr. Filin Sylt and his father, Syl The special jazz wants to see you, and is now waiting in the living room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Filling?" He thought for a moment, wasn’t it the first time in the West, the first knight, dawn? ? His people should stay in the long song fortress, how come suddenly to the border town? “Did they say what it is?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Mr. Film said that it’s related to the witch, let me give this to you,” said the guard. Exquisite parchment, only the pattern above is the "treasure map" painted before dawn, but compared to the rough sketch, the graphic lines on the scroll are just like printed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suddenly remembered, and the film had said that this map came from the inheritance of the family four hundred years ago, and that lightning was found through the mark on the map. The stone tower that Gesha hides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly came to the interest, "Go to call Miss Aisha back, she should be in the chemistry lab now. I will see them right away." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the guard, Roland rolled up the map and came to the meeting. living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling and an old man immediately stood up and bowed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince noticed that both of them were wearing thick leather jackets and a wet mark on their shoulders. The old man had already sweated on his forehead. He couldn't help but smile. "If you feel hot, you can take off your coat. There is heating in the castle, which is much higher than the temperature outside. Be careful not to suffocate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Warm... gas?" The film smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A new heating device is much better than a fireplace," Roland did not explain too much, but instead turned the topic to the other side. In terms of purpose, "I heard that you are coming for a witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness," Xiaoxiao Chenguang nodded quickly. "I met in the convenience market." A blue-haired woman..." He briefly told the story of these days. "After returning to the family territory, my father told me the origins of my family, so I think she might be a witch."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that," after listening to the other's story, Roland was surprised. He did not expect that the Aegusa family would have ordinary people to survive and continue to this day. “There is such a witch in Bianbu Town, and she is indeed called Ai Gesha.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
