			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Miss Soroya!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soloya just walked into the bicycle factory Gilly will greet him. "You come very early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made her a little embarrassed, yesterday with the mystery and Lily fighting the landlord to sleep It was a little late, and getting up today is half an hour later than usual. In the days when Wendy was not there, I felt that everyone was lazy. Of course... Anna and Ai Gesha, except for work or study, they have always been role models for sisters. Especially the latter, always go out the earliest and come back late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the substrate ready?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, please come with me." "Jill, as the first graduate student, has become her little assistant at the bicycle factory. . A year ago, Soloya couldn’t believe that ordinary people would work with witches and get along well with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that a good bike?" She suddenly noticed that today's factory seems to be different from the past, and the steam machine is not as loud as usual. Everyone is looking around a new row of two-wheeled cars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, our first batch of products," Gilly’s face was full of smiles and her eyes were stunned. It’s not easy, especially the chain and the wheel, which is less than half of the finished product rate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy, Soroya thought, this factory It was completed in the autumn of last year, but it has been experiencing various twists and turns, such as equipment not in place, serious shortage of personnel, etc. Its priority is obviously less than that of the steam engine assembly plant and chemical plant next door. The first two are currently in three shifts, and almost every time there are people working, and here is still production during the day and closed at night. Even Ji Lie secretly complained that a partner who went to the chemical plant had already tripled her salary, but the bicycle has not yet seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now she can finally get a bike of her own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door of the production room, Soloya has seen a layer of white paper on the flat ground, about forty square meters, like winter Snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The part that is processed today is the inner tube, it is bothering you," the little girl bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the witch nodded. "You are going to be busy with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hey, please call me immediately if you need anything," she laughs. "I will stay at the door of the factory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the back of Gillian’s departure Soroya knows that she can't wait to experience the ride of the bike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing and shaking his head, Soroya took off his shoes and set foot on the flat paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The painting work of bicycles mainly includes three parts of inner tube, tire tube and frame rust prevention. Which one depends on which assembly in the factory. Of course, in general, the speed of painting is much faster than the assembly speed, so whether it is a tube or a frame, there is a lot of inventory in the factory. It's just that the magic grows every day, and it doesn't cost to be wasted, so every three days, Soloya will still come to the bicycle factory to complete part of the painting work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She recalled the color of the inner tube a little, and raised her hand to summon the pen of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a film for gas, it must be light and soft, moderately tough, and fused at high temperatures. Based on past experience, she chose the shaving coating as the material - this is the result of hundreds of tests, the sky coating is too flexible, and the water wave coating is exceptionally fire resistant until she pays attention to the raw materials. When I arrived at the shavings left by the carpenter, I found the most ideal drawing object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not decompose the metal element as Lucia can mix remelting in any proportion, but must draw on the physical object to understand its performance. At the same time, she can't remember the magical features of thousands of materials, so the easiest way is to make a color card, and then choose the coating on the color card to use it in a wide range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
