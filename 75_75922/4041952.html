			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that," Joel stared at the illuminate with horror, completely disregarding the eye-catching light. "Is there a sale at the show?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has a lot of names, such as Sun Stone, Light Crystal... but we prefer to call it Magic Stone, because I heard it comes from the Devil's Nest," Seventy-six No. whispered, "In the past, "black money" also auctioned this kind of thing, the transaction price is mostly between two or three thousand gold dragons, not only expensive, but also very rare, not every exhibition - at least tonight There is no magic stone in the list of competing products. "She paused. "Adult, are you coming for the first time?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh... that's it. "He feels the guilty feeling of the nose, and the value of each single is so much. Isn't the magic stone used for lighting on the stage more than 10,000 gold dragons? This is too extravagant!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guide is like seeing his uneasiness, taking the initiative to come close, like a lover, attached to the ear. "This is nothing, adults, everyone who attends the underground exhibition for the first time. It will be shocked by the magic stone, which is also the means of "black money" to show ability. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also one of their means, right? "Yu Yao may not be far behind the big aristocratic family in terms of his knowledge, but he is still very comfortable with women, and the gentle and considerate tone of the guide effectively relieves his ups and downs. He pulls the other's waist and pulls it in." In the arms.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" can get your approval. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already approved, after the end of the exhibition..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will still For your service, adults. She nodded lightly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy began to like this place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moved to the booth, the auctioned items have been in the past two rounds, he has not paid attention to what is sold, and the surrounding people are not very resounding, obviously not a good thing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is similar to the exhibition he went to with Danny Ribbon. The first few rounds were generally appetizers, which were the focus in the middle and late stages.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judging that this witch's ranking should not be too late, almost seven or eight hundred golden dragons can be sold - after all, for these businessmen, pure beauty has not much interest, they need stimulation And hunting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the first living person was pushed to the front desk, there was a slight noise in the crowd.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a woman who looks ordinary, except for a better complexion, there is almost no place for people to shine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Joel noticed that the slave market likes to peel off the goods for sale. She is wrapped up all over the body, and she is a gorgeous robes that the nobles can wear. Missy's dress.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this trick? He squeezed the waist of the 76th. "Can the slave be a nobleman raise the auction price?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not a slave as a noble, but a noble slave," the guide said with a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a difference between the two - and so on," Joel suddenly widened his eyes. "What do you say? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a nobleman herself," said a whisper on the 76th. "Itâ€™s not a distant relative or a sideline, but a direct family." Blood, the heir to the jurisprudence. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You adults, have you seen this lady?" "The host sings," Aphne Tanford, the daughter of the Earl from the gravel forest of the Wolfheart Kingdom. Of course, because her father died in the war with the church, according to the law, She is already the new count of the gravel forest! The Tanfon family can be traced back to three hundred years ago, and is also quite famous in the wolf heart, but compared to family history, I believe that the 20-year-old jade stone incident is still fresh in our memory. Now is a good opportunity to return to Tanfon! The lowest price is three hundred gold dragons, please bid by interested parties! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three hundred and ten! "Someone shouted immediately.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
