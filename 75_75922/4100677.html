			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seeing His Majesty the King!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ceremonial officer Blanche Orlando taking the lead Li, all the officials kneel down and form a low wall on both sides of the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meet the King's Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the attendant and servant in the wall, responsible for the palace In the daily care and trivial matters, Roland’s eyes went everywhere, and everyone looked down and looked full of respect and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meet the King's Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is the first army behind him, shouting The sound is especially loud, like a sea of ​​waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that he had seen a lot of people and people, and he also saw the magnificent military parade. He had certain immunity to such occasions, but he experienced it for a moment. Only then did I know that the feeling of being looked up by everyone was accelerated by blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this loud call, Roland stepped up and stepped into the core area of ​​the old king capital - the Twin Towers Temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he sat down on the throne, the officials went into the hall and stood in front of the three. Seeing this nearly a hundred people, Roland can't help but feel a bit of emotion. Twilight City is not the center of the past in the Grey Fortress Kingdom. In just one year, it has recruited so many staff with basic literacy skills, and it is commendable that there is a lot of it. Part of it comes from civilians. This level of education, besides no winter city, should be counted as one of the best in the era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, this is your scepter." Blanche handed over a golden cane, not only carved a beautiful pattern on the whole body, but also at the end. Embedded in a moment of sapphire, "It is made by a dedicated goldsmith, and each king holds a different one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland This naked thing that symbolizes power is not of interest, because it is too straightforward and rude, making people feel like a nouveau riche. However, he soon discovered that this object is not entirely a display. After all, in such an empty hall, it is really not easy to concentrate everyone's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scepter can do this very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his pole and knocked on the floor, and everyone quickly quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You all know who I am, so you don't have to start the game." Roland scanned the entire hall and said slowly, "The purpose of my trip is very simple. It is to eliminate the threat, and the second is to rectify the order. The former is not just a force antagonist, any person who hinders the implementation of the new policy, whether he used to be a noble, a businessman, a free man or a mouse, as long as it is detrimental to the New Deal. Then, the end is exactly the same as the insurgents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The latter is to formalize the order, that is, to establish a set of administrative systems similar to those without the winter city. You should have heard about it. Once you become a city hall official, you can enjoy excellent rewards and treatment, and the road to promotion has nothing to do with family and family. In other words, as long as the ability is sufficient, even a civilian has a chance. Get a position like the Minister of the Department, the Prime Minister of the Imperial Palace!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly burst into a whisper, not to mention the civilians, so high even the little nobility Previously To think about. Barov, as a disciple of the finance minister, is now a hot person in front of his majesty. This is no secret in the old king. When people think of the opportunity to become a royal minister, people's eyes are much hotter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But not everyone can enter the City Hall, you need to pass the assessment." Roland said without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument is even louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty... What is the content of the exam?" asked the courageous person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reliability Q&A, this is also the content that must be reviewed by the Winter City Hall," he explained with a smile. "Not all correct answers are passed, but at least The minimum requirements must be met. As for the specific content, it will only be notified before the assessment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
