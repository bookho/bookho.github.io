			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bell rings, the entire camp is like a boil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna rushed out of the tent and followed the crowd to the wall and entered his own combat position. This set of processes has been practiced countless times, and even if no one is commanding, everyone knows what to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the previous year of the evil month, only a small number of patrols were arranged for each wall in the alert state, and two or three people with scattered evil beasts could cope. . If the lookout whistle observes a large-scale evil beast attack, it will sound an alarm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black shadow on the horizon is approaching, Vanner roughly estimates the number of enemies, about a thousand or so - put a year ago, then It will definitely be a tough battle. As a long-handed gunman who is responsible for the filling time for the firearms team, he must alternate with the reserve team to last until the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the power of the town has changed dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat's claws uncover the gun coat and shake off the snow. Rodney inspected the gun barrels of the field and confirmed that there was no foreign matter and began to load the ammunition. Although the current city wall has been replaced by mud, the height and width have increased, and there is a shelling platform every 100 meters, which greatly enhances the firepower of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The width of the aisle can be used by four people side by side. The first row is the firearms during the battle, the second row is the recruiter, and the latter is responsible for filling the bullets. Play the nest and hand it over to the official soldier in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They don't bother," Rodney yawned. "Every year, the demon moon will run wild, even if it breaks into the town." "Is there any benefit to them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a good idea to give us a hand," Nelson laughed. "It’s still evil compared to a fixed wooden target. The beast is more interesting to play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it comes to shooting, I recently heard an interesting rumor about our artillery team," the pomelo skin looks mysteriously Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the rumor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people who listened to other guns said that they played well. The people will be organized into an elite artillery team to take on a new task," he paused. "Do you know more about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The elite artillery team?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't even know how to know more, how can we know more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whether it’s boring, it’s boring.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only guns in the gun group are not out Hearing, after hearing the pomelo peel, he couldn’t help but frown. Is someone actually saying this as a show off? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Axe found him a week ago and told him that His Royal Highness is planning to develop a new type of artillery that is completely different from the field guns currently in use. It will not be delivered to the First Army, but will be placed on board to make it a warship with long-range attack capabilities. The operator of the new artillery will be the best member of the artillery team. If you want to join, you can apply to the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanna, of course, did not hesitate to agree, this is obviously a further opportunity in the military, according to the iron axe, the prince’s new to this new The arms are expected to be very high, and it is even possible to leave the First Army and become a brand new army. If you can make a great contribution, the newly built warships will be named after the meritorious people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a glory! If there is a warship called the Fanna, he will be satisfied in his life. I remember that I was originally a mining handyman, but I was always self-deprecating. As a result, I couldn’t keep my brother’s life in the slums of the fortress. Now he no longer has to boast of anything - the army does not eat and drink, the uniform is thick and warm; even if you return to the community, the neighbors can call his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all the change that comes down from the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that the decision to join the militia for an egg was the most sensible choice in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
