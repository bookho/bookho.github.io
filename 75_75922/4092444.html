			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night falls, the shadows come from a little bit in the direction of the mountains, as if The ridge is growing in general, and eventually it is integrated with the sky, completely engulfing the brown and green land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia is the first time to see such a scene. When flying in the sky, even if it is a giant like a maiden, its projection is just printed on the mountain river. A small piece of field is insignificant. When the shadow behind it is eaten, it seems to be slow, but there is nowhere to escape, no matter how fast it is flying, it will not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a deeper understanding of the vastness of the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning came close and whistled. "Go down, we are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "嗷——!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behemoth began to fall, and the wolf woman on her back suddenly felt like she was floating. This feeling of falling made her slightly flustered. The hands clasped the fur involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the three landed on a hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The secret base of the expedition," Lightning beckon, "Follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl suddenly disappeared after circling a huge stump. She caught up and found that the stump was hollow. On the side facing the steep slope, a small door was opened, and there was still a pile of firewood and a simple stone chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It takes two days to fly to Taqiela. Today we are here for the night and come back tomorrow morning," Lightning opened the window panel opposite the door. Let the wind flow, the decaying taste in the trunk suddenly dissipated a lot. "Next is the barbecue time, try my craft."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Where is the place...I built it?” Luo Jia looked around curiously. She promised the other party’s invitation and joined the so-called winterless expedition. After all, except for the little girl who promised to take her to the abandoned city, the information about the devil just happened to reach her itch. The more you know about the enemy, the better you will be able to take advantage of future battles. Without a detailed message, it is a last resort. Now that she has a reliable source of intelligence, she has to make a little "sacrifice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s good to accompany two little guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can't be built, just find a place that is naturally created." Lightning quickly rose to the bonfire, lighting up the inside of the stump, "Bug 蛀Empty it, the first half collapsed in the wind and rain, the branches and leaves just filled the trunk, forming a natural ceiling - as for the window and the door panels are cut out from the wheat stubble. There are quite a few wildernesses, and as long as they are careful enough, the explorer will never lack shelters for sheltering from the wind and rain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person’s answer unexpectedly let her Feel reliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the swaying fire, Luo Jia noticed that the simple door leaf and the window panel were nailed with bolts, which could effectively prevent uninvited guests from entering; On the top, there is a smoke outlet that can be opened and closed. Obviously, it can be used to escape in an emergency. The firewood is placed in a high-lying place to avoid being soaked in water. Two ground-through outdoor buildings are also dug up on the ground. Drainage, so although it has some decaying taste, it does not feel wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many similar details, not at all what a minor child can master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was temporarily unable to understand the details of the expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 while taking a distorted twist, take the dried meat from the backpack and bake it on the campfire. Lightning pulled out all kinds of seasoning cans that were squatting around the waist and sprinkled evenly on the surface of the dried meat. The cooperation between the two was quite tacit, obviously not the first time to do such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the seductive scent spreads out in the trunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eat," Lightning handed a bunch of barbecue to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
