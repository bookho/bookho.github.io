			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he thought that the arson tool was easier to manufacture, the escort came in. "Your Majesty, the Northland messenger wants to see you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a day... Roland is a little surprised, are they not going to wait for the Duke to send back the news, but are prepared to directly reject their request? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take them to the living room," he said after a moment of silence. "Also inform Carter to block the diplomatic building and temporarily forbid the people of the messenger to go out." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the other party can’t agree with the policy they are going to implement, they have to take them Strong stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland walked into the living room on the first floor and found the person opposite the long table After changing the seat, the woman who was supposed to be Cole's assistant sat in the main seat, while Cole held a book and sat in the second seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, hello to you, I am Isis Kant, the eldest daughter of the Duke of the Night City, Cole's sister." The woman got up and took a The standard aristocratic ceremony, "This is not the first time we have met. The last time Cole forgot to introduce my identity, please forgive me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calvin Daughter?" Roland was a glimpse first, and then he could not help but raise interest. "So you are the leader of the messenger group?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case," she He said, "My father has entrusted me with full responsibility for this mission, and I also handed over the Duke's letter to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman does not say politics in this era No, but very rare, not to mention a young, handsome woman. It can be seen from the expression of Itis that she is obviously not the first to deal with the superiors, no matter how words or deeds or behaviors are impeccable. As for the concealment of identity, Roland has realized that this is the trick that the other party attracts the negotiators, and she does not deliberately conceal it. It just borrows the disguise of women to let people walk into the wrong zone. It is not deceiving. Most nobles will only Think of it as a fun act. I have to say that this hand is really effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, can you make a decision on behalf of your father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes His majesty, to be precise, he will listen to my opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really confident answer, Roland looked at the coke who scratched his head and couldn’t help but Laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well... Miss Itis, what is the purpose of your request?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Luo Lan thought that she would euphemistically express her inability to accept such conditions, or adopt other more "fun" methods to try to recover the new law, but she did not expect that she would pull out a book from the bag behind her and spread it out. On the table - that's the brochure he wrote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have some questions I would like to ask you," said Itis bluntly. "You said that the reason why the aristocrats will be eliminated sooner or later is because of the continuous expansion of the central forces." You can reduce the assistance of the nobility. What methods do you use to ensure that the vast kingdoms can be effectively managed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...want to discuss politics with yourself ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at her sincere eyes, Roland realized that the other was serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t heard such interesting questions for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the people, and the advancement of technology." He sighed for a while, he replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean those free people? What is technological progress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Wrong, a management team that is trained by the City Hall, the City Hall pays salaries and administrative expenses, and the City Hall provides manpower and supporting facilities. It does not require managers to have strong assets or rich manpower. Therefore, it is not important whether it is a nobleman. Roland began to elaborate on the form that a centralized government should have, and the way forward for ordinary people. Later, it talks about the practical significance of technology to territorial control. This is half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
