			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the biggest contributor to grain production, the story of the leaves has long been written in the "Witch Diary" in the form of comic strips. Such brochures are sold in the convenience market, and it is not uncommon for foreign businessmen to know that her existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the name of the surname wants to work with the witch, he is the first one - unlike the adventurous fjord, the four mainland countries are more influenced by the church, The prejudice against the witch is much deeper. Nowadays some people are willing to take the initiative to contact the witch, and Roland also has some interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the letter, he touched his chin. "From the morning... You should know his address?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Barov said. "He has a record in the Executive Office. I also asked the book to check the tax record and found that his record dates back six years. However, at that time, his business was mainly to buy rough jewels, and occasionally he brought some furs, which had nothing to do with cotton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interesting." Roland knew very well how simple the tax system of this era was. It was completely recorded by the tax official. It took a long time for me to be clear, let alone check. In addition, the resident and the producers can say that after all, the fields can't run there, and like the merchants who flow frequently, there are many ways to avoid the "exploitation" of the local lords. Leaving a tax record means that the other party is honest and trustworthy, which is an uncommon quality in the merchant community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call Victor to the castle," he put down the stationery. "I want to talk to him alone."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, squat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland soon I saw this businessman in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does have the characteristics of the morning sun, like Andrea, the hair is light gold; the facial features are at the upper level, and the skin is well maintained; The gestures are completely aristocratic, and the etiquette is just right. At first glance, I know that my family is very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to imagine that such people need to travel between the two countries for their livelihood. Even if it is a large-scale trade, you can hand it over to a reliable hand, instead of choosing to experience it yourself. After all, even if this era is rich again, long-distance travel is not a relaxing life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party also explained this appropriately - family disputes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to avoid the oppression of his brother and prove his ability, he had to bid farewell to his hometown and go to the Grey Fort to run a business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this part of the story is rather vague, Roland did not continue to ask. No matter what, it is a private matter of others, and he is not interested. The nightingale did not respond, and it also meant that the businessman did not lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the introduction, Roland directly entered the topic, "You want the leaves to produce high-yield cotton seeds, the ultimate goal is to create a new ready-to-wear store. And use the advantages of cheap and good to promote to the whole kingdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why he decided to summon Victor - not that his association is too rich, and It is written at the end of the letter. It’s as if someone submitted a business plan with a fundraising target of one billion, and now you are missing the five hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not just the Grey Fort Kingdom," the businessman nodded. "I calculated the price, and the final finished product is still competitive even if it is shipped to the morning." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low price dumping is indeed a magic weapon to seize the market, but... this is not an easy thing to achieve. “How do you guarantee that it will be affordable?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“First I need special cotton, squat.” Victor is very excited, “Since the leaves Miss can produce three times the amount of gold wheat, then I think she should also triple the cotton production - if the raw material price can be reduced to the current one-third, then the clothes can be much cheaper." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but laugh out, this logic seems to be impeccable, but when you think about it, it makes people feel ridiculous. High-yield cotton is not a difficult thing for the leaves. With the support of the forest's vast magic, her cultivation time can be further shortened. The problem is that the reason why food prices are so low is that they are at a stable food price. Think about it, not that it can't sell high prices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
