			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Zoe said goodbye to his majesty, the goddess who led the expedition went back to the third side of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the high-end devil who was always sighing, she was taken into a secret room deep in the ground, with the same Waiting for Pasha and Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, they are more concerned about the devil's living creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think," closed the heavy stone door, and Els couldn’t wait to hang down in front of her. "Can we win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we not already winning?" Zoe said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ayr did not use her tentacles to point her forehead. "You know what I am asking, don't tease me any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the only survivor of Tacula, her relationship with the high-level witch is undoubtedly closer than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fall of the Federation, the surviving ancient witches began to follow the principle that "every witch is equally important", but the past classes will still remain or Or less impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since she is so relaxed, I think it should be a good answer." Pasha chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact... I am not sure," sees Pasha opening, and Zoe is also serious. "The devil today is probably four hundred years ago." The enemies have great differences, not only in the use of magic, but also in the category of new differentiation." Then she told the entire battle process in detail, "can say ... Akalis adults The idea is correct, but according to her plan, human beings will inevitably fail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual test proves that the witch is indeed a weapon to restrain the high-level devil, but unfortunately With this alone, it is difficult to compete with the enemy on the frontal battlefield - a strong banned body does not mean that it will not be injured. In the face of the new war machine, the greatest advantage of the sorcerer will no longer exist, once the frontal battlefield Unable to break through, the Queen's plan is also worth losing meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming this, Pasha seemed to be relieved, as if he had put down a heavy burden. "So, we did not choose the wrong follower - - The decision of Nataya is correct. This is great..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is great..." Celine also Whispering, her voice is even faint and sobbing. For a person who has lived for more than four hundred years, this is really an incredible thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment Zoe feels the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case where most of the federations supported Akaris, they stood by the Queen of the Day and were in the Witch Empire. At the juncture of the storm, the foundation of the federation was completely torn apart by an unfair raid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoo’s death remembers that a sacred comrade who was seriously injured in her hands leaned in her arms and said in a whispering voice, “You are It ruined everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, they have crushed a huge stone in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing terrible about death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible thing is to bear the incomprehensibility and spurn of the partner, looking for hope in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they fail, it means killing the only possibility for the sorcerer to continue, and that sin can not be offset by death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with such obedience that all talents endure the unconscious empty shell and have persisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akaris’s plan is now proved to be the wrong direction, and they naturally feel a long-lost relief – even if the final outcome is still human But the fate of the survivors will at least not look so sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even so, Nataya is just a tie with the Queen of Stars," El said with a nose that no longer exists. "We have not yet Winning the final victory, it’s too early to be happy too--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pasa!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zou smiled and shook his head. "I haven’t finished yet... although it’s still not clear who can get the battle of God. Victory, but I have seen at least hope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this sentence, the three high-level witches are quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness of four hundred years, hope is the most eager and unsatisfactory thing - no one knows that the chosen people do not exist, but they must find This kind of aimless confusion is always in their hearts, the longer the life, the stronger the torture. At the beginning, we often discussed the ability of the chosen person and her possible age and appearance, but when it was time to start searching for the winners by the "black money" hand, no one dared to talk about this topic easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are afraid of fictionalizing an image and treating it as the goal of finding it - if it finds someone who meets it, but finds it is not the chosen person, such a Disappointment no one can afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, hope has become a luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, they can easily say the word again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient witch who realized this point could not help but fall into a silent feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Pasha broke the silence. "So... can we complete the entrustment of Nataya?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trust?" El said, "Wait--we haven't found a real winner yet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no opinion," Zoe shrugged. "In the ancient books of underground civilization, there is no stipulation that the key holders are male or female? After all, whether or not they have gender concepts is unknown." <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nataya has left a legacy. If anyone can find the winner, then everyone should be her, destroy the devil and reinvigorate Takira. Although the colorful magic stone shows that the chosen ones are somewhat different from their imagination, they can't activate the sacred instruments, but they are consistent in their effect on the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also...I don’t think there is any problem," said Celine’s last speech. "The ancient books also do not stipulate that there is only one winner, and later discover a new day." If you choose a witch, we can change it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since all of you agree...that's okay." Ayr sighed reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are no new candidates to choose from, I think the replacement can save." Zoe looked to Pasha, "What you have worried about." Now, there are signs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't the witches reject you in combat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's not so obvious," she said of Camilla's story. "After hearing me as an interrogator, she promised a request to connect the devil's soul. This also shows that she is worried that the witch is hurt. This idea does not include undead monsters like me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The atmosphere at the scene was a little dignified, as early as a hundred years ago, Pasha I mentioned this possibility, although they think they are witches, but the new generation of witches may not think so. No matter the appearance, characteristics or ability, there is no similarity between the two, not even a witch, even human beings are hard to count. Roland Wimbledon, who can accept them so quickly, is more like a different kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the history of the federation gradually fades out of people's memory, the new awakened may not see them as a member of the witch. More extreme, in order to explore the mysteries of magic and the technology of underground civilization, the witch will treat them as test items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea, although somewhat pessimistic, can be magnified to the scale of hundreds of years, even thousands of years, but it is not impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing Zoe’s self-deprecating, Pasha sighed. "It turns out, but I won't regret it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three did not answer, because this is the path they chose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
