			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage stopped at the side of the road, and the Jom brothers were busy picking up the vehicles together to drive them alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches were finally convinced by Anne after a heated argument, followed by the clown to get into the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the turn of Joel and the rest of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults, we should also go," Yanshan carrying a bag of food through him. "Otherwise, if it is detected by the enemy, everything will be done." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After, I want to say two more words to her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He I thought it would take a long time to make a decision. I didn't expect to confirm the candidate in less than a quarter of an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who stood up was the 76th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Iwam and Anne also expressed their willingness to stay behind, but as the team’s nominal leader, Joel finally chose her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been in the "black money" for five years of fighting training, and I am running very fast, don't worry too much about me. "The statement on the 76th is very simple. It is as simple as an ordinary farewell. "Isn't there a village in front? When I drove the carriage there, and then mixed into the villagers, they could not find me. After the storm, I will join you again - just in the border city of the Grey Fort, you remember to wait for me there. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the magician quietly told him that the answer was that the village was far beyond thirty miles, and it was almost impossible for the people who stayed to arrive there before the knight." And when the carriages are connected together, the progress will be greatly reduced, and the opportunity will be even worse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the pursuer is not coming to the command of the Lord of the Morning If you catch a witch, then everything is a false alarm. But if the other person is worried as a magician, how will the deceived knight vent his anger on the 76th, and he can imagine it with his eyes closed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is faintly aware that if the team is intercepted by the Knights of the Kings, the only one who is likely to survive is himself. Anpein Moya may In this way, Roland asked for a large ransom and mocked him as a laughing stock of the nobility, but he did not easily send him to the guillotine. Apart from him, the rest of the people were basically only dead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he is the one that should stay the most The person who came down to attract the attention of the pursuer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe also tried to stand up several times, but feared that his feet could not move at all, until the end he also I couldn’t say that.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambassador is the face of the king. I can’t be caught by them to sneer and insult, because it is the insult to the king of the Grey Fort. He had to comfort himself so much. If he didn't think so, he couldn't even look directly at the eyes of the 76.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, she was obviously a slave she bought back. However, Joel walked to the front of the 76s and was about to say something. The other party had already preempted the opening. "Adult, this is my own choice. It has nothing to do with "black money" - although silver always teaches us to be prepared to sacrifice for "black money", I don't like it at all. I thought that I would stay underground for the rest of my life, please the guests, wait until the aging to become a new silver, or be assigned as a handyman, never see the sky. I can take me away from there so that I can feel the vast world outside. I have no regrets. Go straight into the woods, and it’s too late to come. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, grown-up," laughing on the 76th Dao, "Without your words, I might have been killed in an underground cave. This life belongs to you." And I don't necessarily have an accident. If there is a chance, let's see you in the Grey Fort. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults must go," the Jom brothers urged behind him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joel took a deep breath and turned away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, she is just a slave.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously thinking about it, my heart is like being blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the woods, Joel finally turned his head and saw that the team had slowly moved forward on the 76th. She did not stop and did not stop. Waving goodbye, as if this was just a simple resignation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just as she stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the shadow of the tree obscured his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On the 76th, the team did not let the team go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about a mile, she let the horse stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, you can't see the entrance to the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She jumped off the horse and sat at the end of the carriage, waiting quietly for the arrival of the chaser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s probably a long time to sit down, but for her, it’s just a short moment. In the long years, the most important thing for her is time, waiting for it. Become a habit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun gradually slanted, the knights appeared at the end of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not wear the emblem of the Knights of the Kings and the satin, but the exquisite armor and high-headed horses showed that the pursuers did come from big cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of the number on the seventy-sixth is a total of thirty-five people, half of whom are obedient. However, it can be seen from their eyes and actions that these shackles are never worse than the knights in small places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the carriage parked on the side of the road, the leader frowned, and he slammed a whip, and the knights immediately swarmed and surrounded the team. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Rogan, there is no one in the car!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interesting...see The ash ambassador who came to us also released the scouts," Rogan sneered. "Cao, Jester, both of you go back and check the footprints on both sides of the road. Since it is abandoning the car, there is no trace." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence has already explained their intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jazz, this woman..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut your hands and feet, simply torture, But since she dares to stay here, you shouldn’t ask anything.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “No, they fled the woods.” No. 76 Stand up and stand up, "It’s not far behind you. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what?" One knight has pulled out the sabre, the other The empty hand reached out to her arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously even if she said the answer, this group of people did not intend to let her go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you don't have the chance to go to the witch again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76 Raised his hand and grabbed the other's wrist with lightning. Then he pulled it hard and the burly knight flew straight out and rushed into her arms like a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his head is just under her arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shoulders are slightly closed, the armor makes a squeaky squeak, and then the slamming, the helmet leaves the position it should be, and the neck The collar of the department was staggered by a distance of about a pound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight is squatting up like a dehydrated fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's let go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, kill her!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
