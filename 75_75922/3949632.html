			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, Film Hilter was sitting in the study, looking at the newly issued educational textbooks, and suddenly there was a knock at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear, I am baking bread, you go to the door," Irene yelled. "Maybe Miss Mey is coming." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed the book and came to the living room door, opened the door The shackles, the people standing outside, were completely unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father! How come you?" Feilin was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"come with the prince of the prince," the old jazz patted the snow on his shoulder. "I arrived at Bianbu Town yesterday, although I mentioned it to them." The son lived here, but they arranged a place for me in a neighborhood close to the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in, cold outside." Quickly let go of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the jazz just stepped into the house and couldn’t help but say, "You have...heating here?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the heating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know today, last time I felt that the castle was not warm enough, I thought that my Highness said The heating equipment is a new type of fireplace. This time I went to the city hall to see that there was no open fire in the room. It was the same warmth. I realized that this thing was originally caused by steam." He took off his jacket and hung the stand next to the door. Above, "Wait... I remember when you went to the castle last time, you didn't know what it was?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was propaganda through the town hall I learned, "Felling poured a cup of tea for his father. "Before they want to do something, they will preach to the townspeople some time in advance. Now the square's notice area is even more popular than the convenience market."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, in just two months, His Royal Highness put this thing on the ordinary residents. At home?" Jazz snorted. "Is it possible to spend thousands of gold dragons in this way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our community is counted as an early installation, West The surface and the north are still digging in the trenches. It is said that water supply and heating are only part of the three-way project. When the project is completed, we can live like the daytime at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it the same during the day?" The Jazz raised his eyebrows. "Does it mean more candles or oil lamps?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No The people in the town hall said that lightning would be sent to everyone’s home.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ray...electric?” the old man yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also felt incredible, but the propaganda of His Royal Highness said so," said the film, "with electricity, the town can be as bright as the day at night." The strange thing is that the news clearly sounds ridiculous, but he feels that if he is under the command of Roland, it may not be possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he is always creating new miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hilde, Sir, you, hello..." Irene also ran out of the kitchen, panicked, her hands I also carried the bread skewers that were half-baked, and almost didn't drop the bread on the floor when I was bowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz smiled twice. "Hello, Miss Eileen. Actually, don't worry so much, I am not hungry now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill sees his wife’s cheeks instantly becoming red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," he cleared his throat. "Today, add two more dishes, and slowly, there are still a lot of time in the evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family had dinner, and Irene finally recovered from the initial tension, three After chatting for a while, she began to clean up the tableware and table, while the father took himself to the study, and the film realized that he had something to explain to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
