			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the narrow high windows of the terrace, the sunset glows over the ground, and the walls are covered with dark red stripes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole kingdom can still see that there are few places left in the setting sun, and the clear water port is one of them. According to legend, the moon of the demon that was covered by heavy snow and cold wind had little impact on the land. Except for the black sail fleet, the whole city was still as busy as peacetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the owner of this harbor capital, Garcia Wimbledon, was sitting at the square table under the window, looking seriously at the letters in his hand. Her gray hair was dyed with a touch of gold in the sunset, and the light and dark interlaced facial light and shadows set off her angular features, unique and full of heroic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farian is standing next to her for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this letter took longer than her normal reading credit, Farion still chose to wait quietly - he did not want to come by himself Interrupt this silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Garcia sighed softly and put the letter down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The father is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farian said, "What?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My father, Ailin Wimbledon, the king of the Grey Fort, is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; < nbsp; She rarely repeats what she said, he thought, if she asked this question, she would only see it as nothing. But she really is not kidding? The king is dead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Farion opened his mouth and tried to comfort her a few words, saying that the exit turned into an inquiry, "How did you die?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Garcia does not care about this - she is the king of the kingdom of the kingdom, the leader of the clear water port, the supreme commander of the black sail fleet, does not need anyone to comfort," said the letter My brother Goron killed his father and was later shackled by his escort. He did not commit suicide by committing a crime, so he was sentenced to a dagger by the hand of the king and several other ministers."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not normal," Farion said subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not normal," Garcia said with a blank expression. "My brother, though stupid, is not stupid enough to find his way. If no one is guiding He can't do anything like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone frame him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let I guess..." The three kings closed their eyes. "Probably someone has arranged a detailed plan and tempted him to say that he is willing to help him." If you want to bring people into the inner courtyard of Wangcheng, you must arrange in advance, including eradication and exchange. And buy it. But that's not what Goron is good at, or that he's too lazy to do these trifles. The rest is simple, the people who plan the plan won his trust, but he betrayed him at the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farian is undecided, these are ultimately speculations, how the process is not important, the key is the result. He believes that His Royal Highness the Three Kings also think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Garcia continued to say, "There are no such ten people in the big prince, there are nine, and there is a brute force in the air. With muscles, it’s normal to be played by people. It’s just...” When she said that she had some anger in her tone, “My second brother’s method is too rough.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, is Tefco Wimbledon doing it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides him, who else is this for Gordon?" Understand? After that, who is the best for him?” Garcia’s fingers unconsciously tapped the table. “It’s just a blind scorpion! But by his father’s preference for him, he doesn’t have to do this step!” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Highness is angry, Farion realizes that it is not uncommon for the three kings to show such a look. It seems that although she has been complaining that Wimbledon III is too eccentric, she does not want her father to end up like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling Faren is more or less able to understand that in the big family, the feeling of the owner to the younger generation is always the same - a want to pass The mountains are both awe and abomination. If she is right, this is what the second prince did, then his actions are indeed cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
