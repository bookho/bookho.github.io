			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When all five asked about it, Roland was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned back in his chair, and his nightingale took the initiative to go behind his back and put his hands on his shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took only one day from defeating the Duke to entering the city to occupy the Lord's Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things are going better than he thought. When the Duke died, most people chose to surrender. The mercenaries went back to the ground and squatted on the ground, expressing their willingness to serve for the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenary guards surrendered to the knight and the nobility. The first army guarded the mercenaries. A group of people marched toward the east in a mighty way and arrived at 3 pm that day. Song Fortress. After seeing the head of the Duke of Ryan and the gang of the captured princes, the guards who guarded the gates opened the gates and greeted the four princes into the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not arbitrarily summon all the nobility in the city, to announce the ownership of the city, but to the Lord's Castle for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle is at the highest point of the central position of the fortress, like a city in the city. When entering the castle area, small-scale battles broke out. After the night smashed the gates of the garden with explosives, more than 20 guards who did not follow the Duke’s expedition tried to stop Roland from entering and were killed by the first army. The other party used handcuffs when they resisted. Five of the players were injured, two of them were seriously injured. Fortunately, Nana Va, who was in the army, immediately cured them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ten escorts who sneaked away from the back door of the castle with the duke family, were found by lightning in the air, and were immediately rounded up. The duke's wife and two sons were shackled - until this time, they were still in the dark, knowing nothing about the news of the Duke's defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After controlling the Lord's Castle, the first army of Bianbu Town immediately took over the defense of the Castle District. It must be said that the castle of the Duke of Ryan is three or four times larger than the town of Bianbu, and the shape is much more magnificent. The six towers form the outline of its regular hexagon, and the main tower in the middle is almost five stories high – a rare high-rise building in this era. The residential warehouses in the garden are well-equipped, and there are even private prisons in the basement of the castle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stuffed the valuable prisoners and the family of the Duke into the cell, the civilians were all disbanded, and the mercenaries confiscated the weapons and placed them in the idle houses of the garden in batches. At the same time, pick a few leaders to give high pay, let them take care of themselves - in the eyes of Roland, the North Slope mine is the best destination for these speculators, but he still has more important things to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the most important Loot link after the battle - commonly known as the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland turned the castle up and down with a witch, and even the stone of the gods placed in the vault and the secret room, he did not let go, a search Down, the results are simply touching. The two large golden dragons found in the basement warehouse are conservatively estimated to have as many as 10,000. The nightingale found dozens of eye-sized gems in the dark cells of the bedroom, and echoes found a dark room behind the fireplace. After entering the secret room, not only are all kinds of gold crafts, such as scepters, crowns, etc., but also a lot of dazzling jewellery, which are hung on the wooden frame of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the financial power of a duke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at this huge fortune, and then thought about the ore revenue of less than 500 Jinlong in the autumn and winter seasons of Bianbu Town. The temptation of plunder is here. If it is not from a highly developed industrial society, he will probably be addicted to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the feelings are sentimental, these things still have to be accepted. In the foreseeable future, the labor force in Bianyan Town will increase substantially, and before the territorial agriculture has developed, he needs a large sum of money to import food from other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hummingbird then lightens a box of treasures, and is escorted by the Iron Axe and the Prince’s Guardian. The trophy is brought back to the castle by the township. . Considering the time it takes to enchant a large item, it takes about three days to complete the shipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reason why Roland decided not to ask for Golden Dragon as a ransom the next day. Eating a duke has benefited him a lot, and now he needs more living people and livestock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
