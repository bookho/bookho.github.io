			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man only reacted after a moment, he slowly opened the quilt, moved to the bedside, and looked directly at the Archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are locked in this ghost place, can you still have something to eat?" he said, his voice murky, like what the throat was blocked. Lived like, "Half a year, trapped here for half a year, no news... How is my son, my daughter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei En noticed that the walls were full of nicks, which seemed to be buckled out with nails. Is the other party using this method to calculate the day? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved the stool and sat down facing the king. "Do you have to ask these things that will make you unhappy?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The other party was silent for a while. "I have no use. Are you coming to send me on the road?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a dying person, what to do with pleasure and pleasure! Before I die, I just want to know their situation!" In the last sentence, Wimbledon’s voice was almost low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help it, Mayn thought, anyway, as a king, his temperament and demeanor were enough. After being replaced by a devout person and on his way to Hermes, he managed to get out several times. At this time, he was not insane, but tried to exchange freedom for negotiation. There is no embarrassment, no hysterical barking, which is rare in the prison of the organs. If it is not impossible to change the plan, he really does not want to waste such people in the conspiracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you came in person and there is an idea to tell him what’s going on, the bishop thinks, or else only one command is needed, there will be a trial army for him. s life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your eldest son, Gordon Wimbledon is dead," Mayn said slowly. "Be your second son, Tiffco. Wen. Bouton was sentenced to the beheading of the beggar, and the crime was to rebel against the king. Your third daughter, Garcia Wimbledon, was independent in the South, self-proclaimed as the Queen of the Water, and the war with Tiffco was inevitable. As for the four sons and the five daughters, we did not Get too much news. Probably... they are still alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about, rebellion? Independence? What did you do?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Spreading the king," he said word by word, "Distribute your children to various places, declare who can manage the best, who is the next king." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wambuton closed his eyes in pain. After a long time, he whispered. "Why? You took the prayer day and took me." Into the cubicle, twilight my clothes... and the stone of God's punishment. You use a witch to replace me with others, you obviously can take this country slowly, let the church Stand in every town. Why should the king orders release fight this kind of thing! I, I simply can not ...... Keke, "talked about the excitement at Wimbledon hunched, severe cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't release this kind of order that will cause children to kill each other", right? Mayn fills the king in his heart. "Maybe you won't, but your children may not be as you wish. When they grow up, they will have their own ideas. For example, your third daughter, Garcia, early I got the clear water port five years ago, even if there is no king order, or, when you die naturally, she will watch the Goron ascendant and remain indifferent? The most important thing is that we don’t have time to slowly, you It should also be noted that the witch's ability is not permanent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, what good is it for the church to fight each other? The church will be caught in the flames," Believers will also die in the war, and the kingdom will be a mess...” said that Wimbledon suddenly looked up and raised his head in disbelief. “Do you want—” a more intense cough interrupt After the king's words, after his recovery, his voice became fine as a gossamer, as if the cough consumed all his energy. "You... want to destroy the royal family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case, but Accurate to say, it is the kingship. "Mayne could not help but praised in my heart, how keen judgment. I have been in this dark day in the dungeon for half a year. Without losing my mind, I have already been determined to be determined. I can still think about it. I have been able to count one hand over the years. "The kingship will hinder the development of the church, no matter how weak it is." It will always grow up like a seedling. Only by eradicating it, the church can truly "get it". ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
