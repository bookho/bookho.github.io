			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eden is a new prince of the kingdom, without a fief, the title Can not be inherited to the children, is the lowest file in the nobility. Even some big aristocrats believe that the jazz can't be considered a nobleman at all, and at most it is just an honorable title. Therefore, he showed great enthusiasm for Tefco's blockade order. He relied on his own experience of drifting at sea in the early years, and the new king preferred to start a newcomer, and finally became the commander of an eagle-headed warship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that his strength lies in the timing of the situation - this blockade of the business road is a good opportunity, away from the comfortable mansion, drifting on the ship for half a year naturally Very bitter, the general aristocracy is not willing to accept such a job, so he can barely come in and do a good job, ten can be sealed as a real aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s easy to do it well, no matter whether it’s a merchant ship or a caravan, it’s not their opponent. If the local lord sends a knight to fight, take the battle of water. The boat is powerless. As long as it is not greedy, this task will be properly completed, and Tiffco will be satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, how satisfied you are, depends on the coins and goods you have paid. Thinking of this, he couldn't help but look at the cheerful mouse on the opposite side of the boat. Yesterday they just intercepted a merchant ship with the flag of Chishui City. Although the captain repeatedly said that he was planning to go to Pitlong Ridge, they still happily swallowed the goods and killed all the people on board. The main items seized were mainly It is fur and fine wine, as well as a can of gold dragon. These idiots even turned the collected things into their own spoils, according to the rules of the Black Street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Eden unable to resist the sneer, the mice did not know, their role in addition to the appearance of robbery, the rest is used to calm down The anger of the local lords, waiting for the rebel Roland to finish, these people's heads will naturally be sent to the hands of the lords who suffered losses in the trade, in order to express their apologies. As for the seized materials, it will undoubtedly be fully filled into the treasury of the palace. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they actually took this action as a fat difference, and did not notice the noose that had been hung around the neck. This is really ironic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, there is movement in front!" The sailor in the lookout shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eden went to the bow and looked at it, only to see a bunch of black smoke in the distance, like something burning in the river. After a while, he faintly saw that a touch of gray was approaching here. There is no doubt that it is a ship, but he did not catch sight of the most striking sails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is its speed a bit fast?" The deputy stared at the moment. Eden also found this, even if it is downstream, it is too fast to move forward. The big one becomes the size of the palm, and it is inferred by distance that it is much larger than the ordinary merchant ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two eagle ships also found the target, and one of the side slats swung up quickly, as if they wanted to grab the stranger in front of everyone. Merchant ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, do we have to keep up?" asked the deputy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eden thought for a while, "Don't worry, let's look at the situation first." He noticed the eagle boat commanded by Baron Deric. There is no movement, and the ship carrying the mouse has been placed on the left and right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boat quickly became visible, Eden gradually opened his mouth, not only him, the deck had already screamed, the sailors on the mast He shouted, "God, head, what is this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the metal luster on the other side of the ship, and unlike the sea The boat is only wrapped in copper at the bottom, it is all in one color, even the strange iron tower above the hull! Its bow is like a shuttle, and the river is turned into two halves. Looking at the white waves that stick to the ship's side, you know how exaggerated the speed of the iron-hull ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“嗡——————” A loud squeaking roll rolled over everyone’s ears, not only did the boat not slow down, but also slightly deflected the course, straight The first eagle head in the front obliquely hit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the joint warfare needs to be pushed into the target from the side, the eagle head has to travel diagonally first. This step is no problem for the slow merchant ship, but it is no problem. The weird iron ship that broke through the waves became a big flaw - it was too late to bring the bow back, and the other side had already slammed into the unguarded abdomen of the Eagle Head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
