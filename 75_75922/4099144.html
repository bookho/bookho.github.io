			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the owner of Silver City, the lonely Gülen family cannot have more money to help the poor - that is, the expansion of the house and the distribution of hot porridge It should be from the hand of the Somalia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the consideration of the other party, he chose to include Hyde in his own home, rather than providing selfless help like a good story between the nobles, but The result does not look bad. The willingness to supply money and food to those who are short of food and clothing, who do not count the rewards, will not be sinister. What's more, Somalia still releases its goodwill through Hyde, which is also a kind of compensation in a certain sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reversely say that even if Hyde is very bad, she will not intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came here just to see her childhood home, and... a little miss the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the nightingale is ready to go somewhere else, a strange feeling suddenly comes to mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, she stopped, what was wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ragged poor, the servants who kept order, the guards of the guards, and the nobles who presided over the situation... She re-scanned the courtyard, her brows wrinkled . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heide did not wear the stone of God's punishment - even the most inferior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fog, his looks and clothing are clear, and the guards at the gate of the mansion are covered by a black hole, only half of them, only I can see the scabbard exposed at the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case, the night owl suddenly realized the source of the strange feeling: Why is a viscount heir, will not wear the stone of punishment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those guards! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Hyde has no prejudice against witches? When the answer just emerged, she was denied. She always remembered the disgusting expression when the other party said "I really hope that there is no such sister, the witch should be in hell and the devil", even if the ability at that time is still indistinguishable. Lies, but looking at his eyes, I know that this is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he has no money to buy God Stone? This may be true for the fallen aristocrats, but not for the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment of hesitation, the nightingale turned and walked toward the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just across the gate of the mansion, the low-pitched conversations of the two guards passed into her ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The aristocrat is really a terrible person. It is obvious that this guy is like us. In the face of adults, I have to listen to the same words as a dog. It’s very different. Isn’t it the secret that adults often hang on their lips?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not talking nonsense,” another person yelled, “The Viscount The adult is now in the house. If someone hears and tells him, you don’t want to pay for this month.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Reassure, my ear It’s very good. When someone approaches, you can find out.” The man shrugged. “It’s not like a dog. It’s not made by me. The temper is so loud, the people upstairs and downstairs can hear clearly.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because he knows that his temper is not good, you should not be in trouble at this time," the latter did not have a good air, "How can adults swear, that It’s also a noble, what are you? Is there a surname in the family? Even the foreman in the village next door is better than you. If not T let me look at you, I did not bother to control what you say <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "yes yes, I shut up okay ...... ah? "He suddenly stunned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I feel that someone has passed the same..." He looked around and said, "Probably an illusion." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disregarding the guard at the door, the nightingale went straight through the wall and passed quickly The Shenshi field has found the room where the Viscount is located - the higher the identity, the better the quality of the stone that is usually carried. She used to rely on this move to confirm the target when she performed the assassination mission, and there are very few missed hands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
