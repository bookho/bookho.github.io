			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the entire refining area is transporting and unloading, or collecting materials, steam power is used instead of manpower. The degree of mechanization is the highest in the winter city. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; as it requires ingestion of large amounts of coal and crude oil, and therefore the factory overlooking the square like a huge rectangle from above, facing north toward a correct Chishui River, both The dedicated terminal is also a coal yard. Several conveyor belts linked to the steam engine continuously transport coal to the boiler room, and the regular black lines running in parallel form a sharp contrast with the surrounding gray cement hardened floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other end of the plaza is used to store seaborne oil from the shoal. The track and the trailers make up the picture of this half. In the absence of coal, the boiler room can also Directly use unrefined oil as a burning substance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil storage warehouse on the west side of the fractionation tower is currently halfway built, like a fortress-like concrete silo lined up, its rough shape and residential on the other side of the river. The small building is out of place, but it has an indescribable beauty. At the same time, Roland knows that its technical content is not low at all, pressure relief valves, inspection windows, ducts, anti-static equipment... From the construction details to the use of regulations, without the accumulation of chemical plants before, it is impossible to be so smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is very pleased that he has only made a final review and approval of the overall plan. The middle design process is coordinated by the Ministry of Construction and the Ministry of Chemical Industry. carry out. Obviously, mines, kiln areas and other projects have allowed them to accumulate a lot of experience and boldly apply them to new projects. Since there is no uniform industry standard in this era, from the elevator to the traction winch, each machine needs to determine the parameters on site and then submit it to the factory for processing and assembly. Without basic engineering literacy and literacy levels, it is difficult to achieve communication between the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two years of compulsory promotion, universal education has gradually shown results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the temperature of the boiler continues to rise, the oil heated to the steam state floods into the fractionation tower - this can be done by the snow on the tower A look at the water vapor. At this moment, the north wind has basically subsided, leaving only the snow falling slowly, but the people who came to visit did not move. They stared at this beautiful metal tower, exhaled breath and various mechanical sprays on the square. The steam echoed in the opposite direction. In the cold winter when the sun was not seen, a warmth was formed that did not fall into the wind. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ...... <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ". it's beautiful," Edith stood on the steel bridge, muttered out sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s almost a few miles away from the refining area, so the figures are much sparse, and occasionally there are rushing passers-by, basically want to go to the tower, except witness In addition to the birth of another novelty, it is also to witness the majesty of the king. However, when passing by the North Pearl, most people will involuntarily look at her and the people on her side - no doubt in their eyes, the two women standing in the snow, there are people The beauty of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't this a chimney? Where is the beauty? Cole’s heart groaned, but he couldn’t say it on his mouth. “Why do you want to see it, why not join the City Hall? Barov’s adults clearly arranged a better position, and he also...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the terrain is high and the horizon is wide, it is not really true because of the distance. More importantly, this is a good opportunity to get in touch with each other. It doesn't matter what you see. All the city hall officials are gathered together, and the meaning is not about watching. The idea of ​​changing to the aristocratic era is like a banquet. The focus is definitely not on the food you eat, but on the people you talk to and the new partners you have met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the elder sister who is very good at communication, she can’t do it without knowing it. It’s clear that he’s tempered in the town hall, but the opportunity is Deliberately absent, sometimes he really does not understand what is in the other's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Itis’s slight glimpse made Cole close his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course for you, my dear brother," she whispered softly. "Do you really want to appear in front of other officials as you are now?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, this is not because of your request! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you wear those clothes at home, you don’t expect to be forced to wear them. If you are caught by an acquaintance, he will only be able to get from the bridge. Jumped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cole was trying to express his protest a little, and there was a whistling whistle behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt a hot face, subconsciously pulling the collar and trying to bury his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this is not the right answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hand against him The chin made him have to look up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Cole saw that the North Pearl returned and flicked toward the passer-by - the one in the eyes who refused to be thousands of miles away. It was cold, and he couldn’t help but shudder. I saw that the other party stepped back two steps, no longer dare to swear, and quickly walked away from her line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you understand?" Itis shrugged. "This is also a test for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...If it's normal dressing, you won't encounter this kind of thing at all," Cole whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you want to participate in the political affairs, you will have something like this irresistible. The only thing you can do is accept it and try it. I drove it." She paused. "Don't you think that when Tiffco was stationed in the North, I was willing to smile and greet him? Everything in the world has different faces. The key is to see which angle you look at it. Besides, you can't help but try my clothes, but my heart is actually looking forward to this moment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cole can't help but a sister can always put something that is not at all The common sense of the move is that the head is the road. At this time, the choice of strong debate will only be defeated. The correct approach is only silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the last sentence, he will never admit it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, is the beauty she said before because of the difference in angle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After staggering the topic and asking the doubts in his heart, Cole clearly caught a rosy on the other's cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you remember what winter in Yongyue City is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃......" He glimpsed a glimpse of a series of pictures in his mind, but there are very few cities in it. Most of the images are stuck in the warm fireplace, ale and dinner. The basics that can be thought of are all indoor scenes. After a while, he was not sure, "Looks like... quiet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s dead, just like the whole earth is frozen. "Itis looked at the tower." I always thought that it was the normal state of winter, but now it seems that this is not the case." She spit out the air. "What do you see now? The earth is breathing, and These fogs are the best proof that it is still active."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't quite... understand."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This proves that nature can be changed," Beidi Pearl said in a word, "People don't need to look at the sky to live, nor do they have to follow the rules between heaven and earth. It is suppressed because of it. We are weak, and when we are strong enough, we can even transform the world. Isn't this power not beautiful enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Cole looks Going to something more beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who said these words is like an inexplicable light, and the long, blue hair is facing the snow and undulating, better than any natural scenery. That rosy is to reduce the sharpness of the past, making the white face of the white enamel become very vivid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly raised a strong impulse in his heart - he wants to know, what is the world in the eyes of Isis Kant? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Out and out!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cheers near Tower One, the crowd gradually rioted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that it seems to be oil!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
