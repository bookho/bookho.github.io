			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not many, His Royal Highness, there will be only two or three such monsters in each month of the demon, otherwise the long song fortress will face great trouble. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, you observed very carefully," Roland ordered the Orion to get up. "What is your name? It doesn't look like a Grey Fortress." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have half of the Mojin pedigree, and the people in the town call me an iron axe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mo Jin, the sand people in the desert southwest of the kingdom, is said to be the descendants of the sand giant. Roland searched for relevant memories in his mind. Instead of using the clan's name, he used the title, and apparently did not want to have a relationship with the sand people. As for why he came to this remote place from the southwestern border, there is still a series of bitter stories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those are not the focus, Bianbu Town does not care about the birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland clap his hands, "I asked about it here today, Carter, rewarding them with ten silver wolves and taking them down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks to His Highness," the three said in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking the person away, Carter Lannis returned and returned. "His Highness, you ask these, do you want to stay here?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is undecided, "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is absolutely not the case, Your Highness!" the Cavalier said loudly, " According to the Orion, the evil beast of the wild boar species is difficult to cope with. If the 50-step outer bow is not worn, it will have to wait for forty steps and thirty steps to shoot. This is only the elite soldiers of the fortress. Coupled with their large number, without a strong wall to rely on, relying on local guards to block, I am afraid that more than 10% of deaths and injuries will collapse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See the witch You said the same before, can't you think about everything?" Roland sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...the witch is evil, but Anna...Miss Anna does not seem to be the case. As your knight, I must seek truth from facts."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what if I give you a wall?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Carter suspected that he was listening for a while. wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will give you a wall, just between the foot of the North Slope and the Chishui River," Roland said in a word, "Although there is no wall of the Grey Castle." Majestic, but it should be possible to stop the beasts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, do you know what you are talking about?" The Cavaliers were laughed, "Noisy There is also a limit. If you don't leave, you can only forgive me for being rude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are three months, aren't you? I looked at the past." According to the record, most of the first snow here comes at the end of February after the winter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three years is not enough! Building a wall requires a lot of workers, from The foundation is picked up with mixed soil. It should be compacted once every one to two feet. Otherwise, there will be a danger of collapse when it is piled up. This is the simplest barrier wall.” Carter shook his head again and again. “The brick wall is slower and needs Hundreds of stone smiths chiseled the stone into squares in advance, and built them one by one. All the walls of the temple were built like this. There is no exception. Let the city rise from day to night, it is a story that is only in myths and legends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland indicates that he does not have to say anything more, "I understand. You don't have to come to a conclusion so quickly. If there is no reliable wall at that time, I will evacuate you to the Long Song Fortress. I have no intention of throwing my life in this ghost place."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight squats on one knee, "I will swear to protect you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;******** ***********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the castle garden, Roland licked the bitter ale and looked at Anna, who was devoted to eating butter cakes. It has recovered a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has decided to stop the evil beast in Bianbu Town - even the base camp can't keep it, and talk about farming. To build a wall connecting the North Slope and the Chishui River within three months, it is necessary to adopt a reasonable plan and technology across the ages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
