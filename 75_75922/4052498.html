			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using this colorful magic stone ring, on the 76th, you can observe the "dialogue" of the witch with the gods when performing magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like a shallow orange light that connects the witch with the vast sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, not only witches, if there is no mistake in the literature, the devil and some mixed species of evil beasts should also see such orange light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods do not love the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I think about this, she will feel very worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the number of the devils is endless, witches can’t be regarded as a strong ethnic group. They can’t inherit, they can’t train, they rely on luck, and they’re magic. It is also far from the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the key is not something that is inherently destined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can change the key itself through high-level awakenings to gain more power from the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Morning Dawn Kingdom, the orange light of Amy, Anne and the hero has been observed on the 76th. The three heroes are the strongest and Anne is the weakest. But overall, the difference is not big, almost all of a finger thickness, far from the requirements of starting the sacred instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has reason to believe that the winner must be a high-level witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the cabin door was pushed open, and the ash ambassador arrived. He picked a brow and went to the bed. "The taste of this herb... is even worse than the pit. How did they use such a stinky thing as a medicine?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;[############################################################################################################ It’s awkward.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s not the medicine, but the extraordinary body of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it doesn't work, I will definitely put their heads into the pit, so that the guys can smell what the potion I made is." Joel picked a bench and sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sailors are too pitiful," she whispered. "I listened to Amy, but you asked them if they had any special effects." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, deceiving the aristocracy itself is a felony, that is, they take it by themselves." The ambassador said, "If you can’t answer it, you can say hot water plus honey. Well, even if it can't cure the wound, at least it will make the patient smile and leave with a smile - ah, I am not talking about you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76 I couldn't help but raise my mouth. During the long voyage, the ambassador came to visit her once a day. There was not much time, but it was really pleasant. She found that Joel may be a mortal with no strength, but he is a woman who is more humorous than most nobles. Even in Taqila, he should not be anonymous. Since losing most of her feelings, language exchange is one of the few pastimes she can enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the other party was uncharacteristically silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things on the 76th thought, with one hand to prop up the body, tentatively asked, "Adult, need me to serve you? Although my The body is a bit less flexible, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking many times, you are no longer my maid. Don't wait for someone to wait for something. You are now a freelancer in the Grey Fort, do you understand?" He helped the forehead. "Not to mention that you still have injuries. I am not the upper class nobles who have morbid hobbies."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There you saying something to say to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Joel’s expression changed slightly, he Cleared the throat, "Oh... there is a question that I want to ask you. After you arrive at the new king, how are you going to do the next day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey... go to the pub as a maid? The casino is OK too." No. 76, Shantou said, "If the witch can really cure this body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
