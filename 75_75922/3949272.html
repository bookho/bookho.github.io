			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the end of the Demon Moon, there have been only two rains in the West, and the rest of the time is sunny, seemingly compensating for the share owed throughout the winter. The office also smelled the musty smell before, the air became fresh and natural, and the window was opened, and the light fragrance that floated in the garden was heard from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the land between the town and the long song fortress has basically returned to its original appearance, and Rolandâ€™s movements towards the fortress have become particularly concerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the situation of the previous year, after the land transportation resumed, there will soon be a businessman going to Bianbu Town to sell daily goods, but now he has not seen one from the long The businessman of the fortress. Lightning is checked twice a day to ensure that the town is well prepared before the enemy arrives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past week, the First Army has entered the stage of comprehensive drills, including the defense line to meet the enemy and the field pursuit. The former relies mainly on lightning to report enemy distances in the air, and the artillery and firearms shoot according to instructions. This part is easier, and the instructions and corresponding actions are clear. For example, when entering the 800 meters and 500 meters, the solid shells are shot, and the ammunition shells after the 300 meters are approached, and the guns are fired after 50 meters. As long as you see the flag of lightning, the team leader will inform the players how to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key lies in the field pursuit phase. According to Roland's plan, after the other party was defeated, it would take three days to retreat and return to the fortress. Even if the militia and the mercenary are returned, the time will not be less than two days, so the other party must camp in the wild. This gave the first army the opportunity to pursue. Surrounded by lightning, the First Army followed the safe area that was not found by the scouts, and the artillery and ammunition were transported by the township. When the other party established the camp overnight, the troops completed the encirclement, and then launched a pinch in the early morning to destroy the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan does not seem complicated, but in the absence of radio communication, it is almost impossible to separate the troops and then combine them. Roland can only invest in witches in this link to make up for the lack of communication. The final result, his heart is not at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that there is not much left in the reserves of gunpowder. Therefore, instead of live-fire shooting during the comprehensive exercise, the main training is the collaboration between the firearms and the artillery team, and the first The cooperation between the army and the witch. He has sent people to the farther down of the Dragon Ridge and Chishui City, hoping to find more sources of saltpeter there. If the gunpowder cannot be replenished in time, I am afraid that after two battles, the musket in the hands of the First Army can only be used as a spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland will write some new procurement plans on paper, including saltpeter, grain, seeds, etc., and intends to let Barov send another apprentice to the Grey Fort. The king is trying his luck. There are plenty of goods there, especially saltpeter - as the summer approaches, Wangdu's sugar field must have been fully operational. As a city with a large number of aristocrats and wealthy businessmen, once the weather is hot, the consumption of saltpeter will be astonishing. He hopes to find a stable supplier and provide gunpowder raw materials for Bianyan Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, he has sent two guards to carry out the "Call for the Witch" and "Find the Fruit" plan. The former is generally pretending to be a traveler or a businessman, spreading rumors of the witches in the town of Bianbu in places such as street corners and pub black markets. Of course, the custodian is not the four princes Roland, but finally finds the holy mountain, and hopes that the witches will go to the co-help club for settlement. The latter goes directly to the clear water port to buy exotic crop seeds from the other side of the fjord. Of course, if there are any rare crops in the city that passes through, the seeds will be brought back together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After writing the purchase order, hand it to the book and let her go to the town hall and hand it over to Barov. After the book leaves, Roland stretches out and wants to drink saliva, only to find that the cup is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was about to get up and take the kettle, the nightingale had already mentioned the pot to his desk. More than that, she smiled and filled the cup and brought the kettle back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland slowly took a sip, and his heart was puzzled. Recently, the attitude of the nightingale is really wrong. He always has a smile on his face, and he also actively helps the tea to pour water. Is this a salary? In the past, she sat directly on the sofa chair and held the dried fish slices for an afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Roland also asked the reason, but the other party laughed and did not answer, he simply had to let it go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the non-Kunte brand really make people happy? In the future, I will get poker and mahjong out and open a casino. I just waited to collect the money... I stopped, and Roland shook his head and threw the distracting thoughts behind him. Now is not the time to enjoy the fun, he must consider the things after the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
