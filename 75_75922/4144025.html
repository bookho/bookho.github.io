			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next afternoon, a group of people followed the pomelo peel to the second machinery factory in the industrial zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief explanation, the pomelo’s brother, Lafite, showed a strong interest. He took the rifle handed over by Fanna and put it up and down. "Is this really ok? I used to be a miner. Now I am doing rough work like grinding and cutting. If I accidentally broke it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother!" The pomelo peel coughed twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a problem if you only have one or two. After all, the firearms will be damaged when you practice." Fanna said frankly, "If you exceed this number, you can only explain My thoughts won't work, I won't blame you on your head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand," Lafite excitedly nodded. "Then please Give it to me! But the machine tool in the factory is not necessarily free. I try to take the time to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your brother seems to like the gun." The cat's claws pull the pomelo peel and whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's no surprise," Rodney leaned over. "Who doesn't like powerful weapons? It used to be a sword and a sword. Now it's replaced by a gun." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fana is deeply convinced that he also gradually transferred his preference from boiled eggs to this after seeing the power of the twelve-pound field gun. Responsibility. Opening the leather bag carried by the companion, he took out a metal tube removed from the scrap heavy machine gun and said to Lafite, "So let's start now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rifle barrel was removed and secured to the drill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lafie twists the switch, aligning the drill bit to the marked position, carefully pulling the distance between them. When the drill bit comes into contact with the pipe body, silky metal scraps splash out instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Fanner, this is also a very fresh scene, even though it is clear that whether it is a steam engine or a fortress gun, it is processed from a piece of metal ingot. But such close-up viewing is still the first time. The indestructible steel in consciousness has changed its shape a little bit under the drill bit, just as its hardness has ceased to exist. This experience is truly amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Lafite, some of the machines in the second machinery factory have been replaced by the third generation driven by the "Twilight One", compared to the past Machines powered by steam engines are much easier to use, both in terms of tremors and noise, and can be activated at any time. As long as the technique is excellent, some masters can even sculpt flowers on the finger-sized iron bars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Fanna doesn’t need such a superb craftsmanship – after a night of thinking, he has combed his entire idea. In short, it is to achieve the goal with the fewest steps and a handful of resources. After all, this transformation is both simple and easy to use, and does not hinder the normal production of the factory. To this end, he deliberately brought the air pipe on the Mark type, in order to simplify the difficulty and save processing time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the key parts of the molding, the first step to extract the gunpowder gas is no longer a problem. The focus is on how to achieve continuous shooting of firearms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Vanner had an interest in the heavy machine guns of the guns camp long ago, and there was no such thing as the baby in the air defense team in the Northern Expedition. . One thing he can be sure of is that the Mark I type has a much larger gun body than the rifle in order to accommodate the next complex retraction mechanism, and the way the chain is inserted into the cymbal is not the same as the magazine. Moving over is not realistic. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if this is feasible, it means that the heavy machine guns whose output is low will also have a part of the parts for the artillery, even if Brian is indifferent, iron The axe will definitely give him a skunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way is to not make any changes to the gun body and focus all changes on the gun body as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is almost the same..." Lafite cleaned the hole and compared it to the sun outside the window than the rifle barrel and air tube. "After cutting If there is more of this section, the two pipes should be able to match."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
