			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sisters, that is the holy mountain! We found it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hakala scream Letting out your own joy. Not a girl and a witch stand in the same place, shocked by the wonders in front of her, and some reacted and cried with her companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Akasaka has frowned. "Is that really a holy mountain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What's wrong, is there anything wrong?" asked the leaves in a low voice. She also had the same doubt in her heart. The city in the sky did not look as golden and magnificent as the ancient book described. Although the spire is spectacular, the whole body is grayish black, even in the daytime. Not to mention the red mist that overflows over the city. It is as thick as blood that cannot be opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is something... squeezing in those holes," Akasaka’s voice was a little dry. "I don’t see it clearly, but those things are not quite like The gods..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves feel a layer of goose bumps in the body, and the farthest seen in the assisting group is red, and her statement makes the leaves faint. Some are upset. Unfortunately, lightning has left with the nightingale, otherwise she can let her fly closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sisters! The holy mountain is in front of you," the instructor raised his hands and shouted. "Add another effort, we will find eternity soon!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she said she immediately urged the stone girl to carry her forward. The leaves want to go forward to discourage, but they have taken their feet back. She remembered Wendy's end of the game half a month ago. At this time, I am afraid that any dissuasion is meaningless. I don't want to see it myself. The tutor will not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group began to accelerate. After leaving the foot of the mountain, the snow accident was reduced, and the surrounding temperature also picked up. This is the legendary forbidden land, and the area where humans can't set foot. The leaves think, but they are now printing their footprints on this uninhabited land. If lightning is there, she will be very happy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking back, the mountains of the mountains are undulating behind them, like an unreachable barrier. This makes the leaves can not help but guess, is it because of the desperate mountains, so that the evil beast can not directly attack the hinterland of the mainland, you need to detour to the north of the land? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, if you can find the holy mountain, you don’t have to wander and wander, you will be satisfied... She sighs softly, tells the truth, when the night When she talked about what she saw and heard in Bianbu Town in the camp, she was heart-warming. When Wendy asked who would like to leave with the nightingale, she couldn't help but want to go one step further and report her name aloud. But until the end she still couldn't cross the shackles in her heart and lost to the shadows she had left in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaf gimmicks, let yourself not think about these past things, keep up with the pace of the team, and sprint in the yellow and white wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the weird things happen very quickly, no matter how fast they speed up, the city always retreats at the same speed as they do. When an hour came down, the "Holy Mountain Place" was still suspended in the clouds, neither big nor shrinking, just like... they didn't move at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, please take a break, the sisters are tired," said the stone girl. During this period, I have changed a few waves of people to bear the mentor, she is the one who insisted on the longest time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, how can I stop now!" Hakhara rejected her suggestion without thinking. "This is the test of the gods, the sisters, not firm." Will, can never reach the holy mountain! Can not stop, must go on until the door of the Holy Mountain appears in front of our eyes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See persuasion is invalid, one line People have to move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has not changed. In the hurry, the witches also encountered two waves of evil beasts. In the second wave, two deformed mixed beasts appeared, and the leaves were mixed. The grass bondage failed to persist for too long, and a sister could not take care of the lower neck and was cut by the claws. The blood was scattered on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving these monsters, everyone found that the sky was gradually darkening, apparently at dusk. The city is still in front of them, but the outline has become more blurred and seems to be disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to past experience, they must find a suitable place to camp to build a camp, but here is completely different from the desolate mountains, looking almost flat, plus The evil beasts that may appear at any time, they can't spend the night in this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
