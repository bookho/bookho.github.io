			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia just got on the corner of the wall and saw the scene that shocked her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a row of militiamen dressed in warriors standing on the wall, holding a strange weapon in their hands - mostly the musket in the ash mouth. As the evil beasts approached, the musket spurted out flames and smoke, and the continuous explosion rang in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be a weapon similar to a bow, but she can't see the other party's shot, probably because the smoke is too big. The evil beast that rushed to the front was like a thing in the middle of it, and it was planted one after another, and it fell to the ground one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the soldiers did not observe the results of the war, nor did they fill the stalks, but continued to shoot at the enemy, which was a bit faster than their own bows. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the terrible weapon you said?" Andrea felt her lips dry. "The rate of fire is really fast, but the hit rate seems..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before these people were recruited, they were all miners, farmers and hunters," Ashes interrupted. "The time they used this weapon is not yet In the first half of the year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A well-trained warrior takes five years to train, and the archer is longer, even the shortest bow of the training day. In the first half of the year, the farmer will not be allowed to put aside in the panic. As for the actual battle? God knows what they can shoot, and most of the time they are just taking advantage of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrei ** can't help but swallow, she is no stranger to these trainings, the family has also trained outstanding knights, so naturally understand half a year What it means to be able to invest in actual combat. As long as the weapons and food can be fully supplied, Roland can piece together a huge army in a short period of time, and this army is not worried about a sudden collapse in the close combat, no intermittent attack, even the elite knight is difficult to get close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has nothing to do with the courage and will of the militia. It is the weapon that gives them a powerful force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any other knowledge of the musket?" Tilly pondered for a moment and asked Sylvie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter nodded. "I have observed it many times. It is indeed a weapon similar to a bow. The arrow that is emitted is very short, no arrow. There is no tail feather in the pole. The difference is that the arrow does not rely on the elastic force of the string, but the impact of the black powder explosion - it can raise the arrow to a very high speed in an instant."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black powder?" asked the ashes, "What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably an alchemy product," she Shaking his head, "I don't know the specific ingredients."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be very expensive," Andrea, "The things that the alchemist created are always It’s not a bargain.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agrily, "Well...but watching their shooting attitude is not like how expensive items are used." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, something has come," said Hillvi, who was looking at the battlefield, "God. Is this also a beast? The wall is high! It looks like a huge tortoise with a huge carapace on its back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Delia suddenly came to the spirit, "Carapace? These muskets may have limited effect. Just let me get close to the ten-step range, even the wall can't stop my magic arrow. Ash, you cover me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, okay," Ashes has no choice but to take off the big sword behind him. "First, let's not lose the face of Tilly."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't go," Sylvia stopped. "They still have-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andre Ya did not hear the other party's second half of the sentence, she only heard a deafening roar, like the thunder in the ear. Looking back, the metal tubes that stood on the wall invariably ignited the flames. This time, she vaguely captured the trajectory of the arrows flying. They were like a shadow, and they were far away from the thunder. The monster that just appeared flies away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
