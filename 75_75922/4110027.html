			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour and a half, Roland, who had been on the phone, finally received the last report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingales responsible for the ambush not only did not release a devil, but also seized a pile of gas tanks that store red fog. Coupled with the enemy of the air defense team and the madness of the forest captured by the leaves, this defensive battle has achieved more than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and foremost thing is to reinvigorate the morale of the First Army - although the enemy is not as easy to deal with as the Knights or the Evil Beast, they have at least The power of counterattack. And the legendary devil is not as vast and unpredictable as the ones recorded in the ancient story. They are still physical bodies, and as long as they are hit by firearms, their resistance is not much better than that of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second with the captives, the propaganda work without the winter city is easier to carry out. Roland believes that it is only necessary for the migrants to see what the devil looks like, and the prejudice that remains for the witch will not break. A monster that is very different from human beings and whose language is impassable, how can it corrupt the witches who are thousands of miles away and turn them into alien paws? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final harvest is the enemy itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the blood of the magic can't be saved alone, the subject will be quickly inactivated after death. He didn't expect to use the enemy's blood to add new marks. . Unexpectedly, in the case of Ai Gesha's return, Serin took the initiative to make a job of making a print. According to her words at the time, Aegis is indeed the most outstanding group in the entire Quest, but the basic voicing is a must-have for the formal members of the Quest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the quality of the print, in addition to the quality of the stone, blood, the characterization of the vein is also a key, although not as important as the former two, urgent When you use a wooden stick to draw a straight line, you can use the delicate and uniform multi-segment to better play the magic stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is more precise than the tentacle to achieve this - whether it is touch, strength or quantity, the tentacles are incomparable to the fingers. Advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the "boasting" of Celine, Luo Lan took a while to reverse her endless thoughts, but fortunately, communication could not be seen. These deep thoughts, or else he can't wash the Yellow River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this defense war is not all good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark type heavy machine gun can only be called barely used for air, and it can be found through the whole situation. It is the target that causes the greatest damage to the devil. The volley when approaching the city wall. Since there was no expectation of being attacked, the devil's formation was divided into two waves, which were very close to each other and the speed was flat, which was the most ideal target. As a result, only four of the twelve beasts were shot down. After entering the range of the spears with irregular trajectories, there was no shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the best throwing distance of the madman is almost within two hundred meters. Mark's almost straight trajectory makes the hit rate rise again. The head of the beast has been killed, which also allows the remaining devil to give up the fight and choose to evacuate immediately. In other words, if the enemy's range is a little further, or if it is snaked in a distracting queue from the beginning, this battle will undoubtedly be much more difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, for air forces that come and go free, ground air defense itself is in a congenital weak position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, the improvement that Mark One can make is nothing more than adding protective steel plates or simply making the turrets to ensure that they are invincible when dealing with airborne enemies. At the same time, the production volume will be further expanded to cope with the official war after the arrival of the Red Moon. Roland understands that without an air force that can also come to freedom, it is impossible to truly eliminate the threat of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But letâ€™s put these things aside for the time being! He put down the quill in his hand and took a sigh of relief. He always triumphed, even if it was insignificant. It was also the first time in human history to rely on hot weapons to win the air defense campaign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Roland ordered someone to call Barov Mons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight, a celebration ceremony was held in the Central Square. According to the standard of Victory Day, you should do as much as possible. This is also part of the promotion. Do you understand? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
