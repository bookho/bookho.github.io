What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like the patriarch of all clan ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that the same as the Three Gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stage sounded At this time, the Blackwater clan leader who fell to the fourth place jumped on the high platform and loudly questioned: "But you said Roland Wimbledon is the king of the North, he is not a Mojin. How can it lead the entire desert?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the ash is a dark one, which is one of the key issues that you want to face when you want to integrate the polar South into the Grey Fort. Then, let's see how the echo should be dealt with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respond to the other side and calmly asked, "So the three gods who once led the desert... are Mo Jinren?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not very loud, but reverberates in the ears of everyone under the spread of magic. The Black Shui patriarch is no exception, he can't help but sigh, "Hey, this..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We all know that the answer is no," the echo saw him suddenly and dumbly, re-focusing on everyone under the stage, "The Three Gods Messenger is the real giant." In the legend, they do not have the same appearance. Some have four legs and three hands, and some have many heads, but there is no doubt that they are not Mo Jinren!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, she suddenly raised the tone a lot. "And the words left by the messengers have become the norms that Mojinsha people have abide by." These laws on the slate are exactly about ruling the desert. The record of the people, one is to receive the blessing of the Three Gods, the second is to open up a vast oasis, so that all the people can be far Hunger and death. As long as you do one of them, you should become the master of the extreme south!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument suddenly subsides, no one will be burning The land objected to the rhetoric left by the messengers of the Three Gods. In fact, even the sacred duel is derived from the distribution of power in the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Three Gods messenger did make the desert evergreen," the Black Shui chief was not willing to ignore, pointing to the echo, "Some thousand years ago Here, it is an oasis in itself! Can the King of the Grey Fort in your mouth do this too? Don't be blinded by false interests, what is the difference between having such power and the gods!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So as long as he can bring a new oasis to the sand people, you will recognize that you have the qualification to have a very polar South, and give him the main, right?" The echo raised his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. And not only me, I am afraid other people think so!" The Black Shui chief did not mention the first condition and will be present most of the time. The opinions of the people of Shamin are tied to themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland's squats really can't turn the extreme south into a green land, but he is willing to let us enter the gray fort, let us live by the lake and the forest, forever No longer threatened by thirst and sandstorms!" Echo came to the stage and said word by word, "This is the promise given by His Majesty, he will bring a new oasis - and the vast north is precisely The endless oasis that will never fade!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone suddenly took a cold breath and could hardly believe his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram is equally shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that this is the real purpose of the Aosha clan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the meaning of the new oasis and new order in the iron axe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a land of immortality is the dream of all Mojin people. For those small clan who cannot compete for Tiesha City, this temptation is even more unimaginable. Even if the big clan hesitates and does not want to see the earth-shaking changes in the order of the extreme south, it can't stop the spread of the news - I am afraid that it will take half a month, this amazing news will be taken by the people from the various Yinchuan oasis. Spread throughout the desert! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is simply a nonsense, a lie, a deception!" The Blackwater clan screamed, "Don't you forget the Black Bone clan?" And the tragedy of the sandstone clan? They just because of the conviction of the Queen of Water, the words of the Queen of the Water, only to the end of the death of the dead! Give oasis and water sources? The deceitful Northland talent will not do this, they will only give you A pond, a palm-sized territory, lets you fight like you are in the extreme south, and you have to sell them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five duels, one death, the image of the benevolence of the Aosha clan has spread throughout the small oasis. With a little guidance, it is not difficult for everyone to form the same kind impression of the North Kings behind Aosa – and the benevolent will obviously not Squeeze the sand people like the Queen of the Water. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the challengers of black bones and sandstones are willing to sell themselves to Garcia, which is enough to illustrate the attraction of the place of existence. Even if it is known that it may be a trap, there will be a group of people who will try to go to the trial. If the king of the Grey Fortress sincerely wants to put the extreme South into the jurisdiction, these pioneers will inevitably become more role models for the clan. As long as this head is opened, the whole family’s move to the north is almost doomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the creation of the momentum to attract the attention of many clan, to not kill one person to create a benevolent image; to become the head of the clan with the undisputed sacred duel, while at the same time let the lenient Other big clans are reluctant to turn against Aosa in the eyes of the public. This step-by-step move is obviously planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that he would play a pivotal role in the establishment of the Aosha clan in Tiesha. As a result, he discovered that he only provided the necessary The tribes, as well as the intelligence of the major clan of Tiesha City, and for the real plan, he was completely stunned in the drums - the other party did not regard the Tiesha City as one thing at all, and revenge was just a little effort, this feeling had to Said some loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the loss is just a short moment, and Thuram quickly cheers up, if everything really is like the new owner said, Aosa The question will become the first existence of the far super clan. Then, as a member of Aosha, he obviously can get great benefits from it. Compared with the future with a promising future, what is this little loss? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the echo shook his head gently. "You are wrong, the patriarch, Jiaxia needs mercenaries, not the people, this is her The biggest difference between it and Roland’s Majesty. It is because of this that she has picked up the black bones and sandstones with strong fighting power. It can be different. He regards all Mojin people as their people, so any clan can go to the Grey Fort. The kingdom has nothing to do with how many young men of the tribe have, and it has nothing to do with whether the strength is strong. He does not need the sand people to sell his life - any benevolent king will not sit and watch his own people dielessly!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the price? We have to pay something?" The flaming patriarch Gulz stood up. "He can't help the sand people for no reason, I I don't believe that there is a gift in the world that doesn't care about giving back!" He bit his teeth. "You say it, I am willing to accept it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland wants to think It’s very simple, it’s work.” Echoes calmly said, “Like his thousands of people. Like, work for the kingdom, work for yourself! Receive remuneration, improve life, receive education, raise future generations... This is what he wants to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just... like this?" Gould couldn't help but groan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, a road that can survive without killing and struggling!" The tone of the echo rose again. "Everyone knows, Yinchuan Oasis It has become less and less... I was still a child, and the oasis was occasionally seen near the southern end of the endless cape. But now, the white wasteland in the northwest is expanding, and the oasis is turned into sand. The small oasis around Liansha Sand City is smaller than before. Is it that Mo Jinren has always planned to rely on the fight against the battle to win the land of survival, immersing the blood into the yellow sand, and finally disappearing into the extreme with the oasis? Tell me, are you willing to accept such a result!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I want to go with you, Silvermoon adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please bring me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd rang out like a wave, spreading from the center of the high platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the beautiful woman on the stage who gathered the focus of many clan eyes, the iron axe couldn’t help but kneel down, and a line of tears poured out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene has been seen many times in dreams, especially the night when Aosha became a challenger. However, when the dream woke up, the clan no longer existed, and the princess became a slave. He thought that he could never see such a day again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the echo is much closer than the scene in his dreams. This feeling makes his eyes sore, but his heart feels full and proud. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
