			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Lightning told his plan to Mai Hao. After a brief discussion, they decided not to search Shilin District layer by layer. Instead, speed up the pace and fly straight to the Rift Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether there is any new discovery, after drawing the topographic map of the area, it will return to the snowy ridge of Yongdong, and meet with the Taqila witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the sun just emerged from the skyline, the mist between the mountains, the crooked water can see a hoarfrost, it was the night flood Traces left behind. As the terrain climbs slowly, the whiteness in the field of vision increases, until the mountains are everywhere - and the rift in the distance is completely covered with snow, and looks like a white porcelain with a buckle. Giant bowl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the estimate, it is about three hundred kilometers away from the Kingdom of Yongdong, and its area is enough to match the extreme south. The Federation’s glimpse of the rift has also been recorded in this rift, which is believed to have been formed by volcanic eruptions, but it has now completely subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning has also seen the volcanic craters of the burning islands that smoked smoke and sulfur all day long, but the scale is really poor compared to this mountain range. Too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hours later, the expedition approached the Great Rift Valley area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spectacular and peculiar topography is finally in the eyes of both. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good... great," Mai said with a flap of his wings. "I feel that this pit can be filled with a whole kingdom."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning can't help but nod. The rift that she thought was actually not a fault in the earth. The shape of the platform is not the peak of the mountain here, but the ground image. It is opened from the inside to the outside, and the rock formation that has been raised forms an irregular "mountain wall". From the sky, it looks like a scar on the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is really a "break" caused by the eruption, how amazing will it be at that time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two pressed down the height and landed two or three kilometers away from the Great Rift Valley - in order to be on the safe side, the first thing is the wheat stubble, after all, she can Perfectly integrated with the local environment, even if it is hit by an enemy, it may not be recognized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen," Lightning said. "Don't go deep into the cave and hover along the crack. If you find anything strange, you can't." Going alone -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be sure to report to the head of the team first, and then decide the next step together." Mai Hao interrupted, "I know I know 咕You have said it many times... just like Roland!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, is it?" Lightning was a little embarrassed to touch the back of the head I remember that when Roland used to marry her, she also confessed to the members in private. A genius explorer naturally knows how to make the most reasonable judgment, which needs to be picked up. Looking back now, she was really childish at the time. "Cough, in general, it's important to say a few times without any harm! I will stay here, by the way, search for the nearby area, no more than one kilometer. Remember this position, and return within thirty minutes, understand "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, go." Lightning Patted her shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mc茜, Depart!" The latter then fluttered toward the center of the Great Rift Valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until her figure completely disappeared into the field of vision, the lightning recovered her eyes and carefully looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow is a common bird in this place. It is a kind of owl. It can be active during the day and night, and its vision is excellent. As long as it does not act rashly, it is unexpected. The possibility is extremely low. It is easy for herself to be exposed. There are glaciers everywhere, and there are almost no traces of beasts. If a demon emerges suddenly, she will become the most visible target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So instead of looking for signs of enemy activity, lightning first observes where you can hide or hide. She can no longer throw the troubles to others to clean up as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning couldn't help but glanced at it. When I saw the sound, I saw that Mai Xiao swooped down in a panic and slammed into her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are devils, devils!" The little girl shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly jumped in her heart, is there really a stone vein here? "What did you find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A huge warning eye, you squat on the stone wall below the hole!" McMug danced and danced. "I just flew over the hole and just looked at it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means that the eye also saw her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning couldn’t help but give birth to a good fortune, but fortunately, I didn’t always rush to the first one as usual, seeing the witch and seeing the bird completely It is two different things, a snow scorpion should not cause the other party's vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And then, you didn't scream out on the spot?" In order to prevent it, she asked more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am an experienced bird - no, the explorer!" Mai Hao stood up and said, "Don't say exclamation, I was then I didn't even have eyes, and I pretended to look around in the scenery, and I turned my eyes away! I bet it has forgotten me now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flash computer has flashed another picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A snow scorpion has widened his eyes, and the eye of the guard on the rock wall has a big eye and a small eye. Then he turned his head and deliberately twisted elsewhere... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's bad, bad!" She grabbed the wheat stuble and rushed to a hidden spot she had discovered before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕?" and the latter has not reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an ice cave hundreds of meters away. It’s probably surrounded by rocks. The snow doesn’t fill the cracks below, just enough for one person to hide. . After the lightning broke into the cave, he lowered his body and barely looked at the top of the rift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, a "door" with a strange glow appeared in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a devil walked out of the door, it was so straight over the Great Rift Valley. Lightning felt that she was breathing a little bit slower - on the other side, she felt as much as the pressure of facing Ursuk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil looked around and saw the sudden rushing down the mountain! For a moment, Lightning felt that the blood of the whole body had to be solidified. The body almost subconsciously wanted to turn around and flee. If it wasn't for the other's orientation and the hiding place, she was afraid to follow the instinctive reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil plunged into the snow and ice, splashing a large cloud of white fog, and when it stood up again, there was already a ferrets in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning swallowed and touched the chest involuntarily-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Mai Hey still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil put the frightened snow scorpion into the gaze for a long time, and finally seemed to shake his head with a little disappointment, let go and let go. The latter immediately screamed and flew toward the sky, and quickly turned into a white spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil did not stay too long, it once again held hands with both hands, tearing open the door of the light in front of the empty body, and then into it, Disappeared in front of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning finally breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the whereabouts of the expedition were not exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... what should we do next?" McMug finally realized his "wrong reaction" at the moment, and asked his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in the past, lightning will probably choose to try to sneak into other places - the Rift Valley is so wide, even if it is alert, it is impossible to monitor every corner. For the explorer, the first finder and the second finder are separated by one person, but the meaning is completely different. If she can, she always wants to be the first person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
