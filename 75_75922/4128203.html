			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, a little bit..." Roser whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" Sean looked at her. "Where is this interesting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Tell you anyway, mortal." Rosen opened his thick lips. "The underground civilization has left traces throughout the mainland. Takira naturally did not study them, and these symbols..." She went to mottled In front of the column, the dust on the top is lowered. "It is not the words they use. It has nothing to do with the magic characters made by the Federation. Is it not interesting enough to think of the history of the four kingdoms?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akima found that she could not understand at all, although the meaning of each word was clear, but together they did not know what to say. To her a little comfort, the great aristocratic family, Marr, was as confused as the local guide, Naf, and was no better than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn showed a thoughtful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have heard that the four kingdoms used to exist only in scattered villages and small towns. It is considered to be the corner of the mainland. The so-called history is no. History. If this ruin is not left by the civilization in the war of divinity, then it means—”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is here to slam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, I used to live in an alien that we don't know yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet In conclusion, "Rosser has a lot of interest, "Whether underground civilization will differentiate into tribes and create different languages, this is an unknown number. Only by going in and looking at it can you get more information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shawn, there seems to be a stone tablet here," the soldier who was checking Stonemen suddenly shouted. "It seems to be writing our words."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of people suddenly surrounded the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a piece of granite lying across the weeds, covered with moss, only one side has been polished, if not carefully searched Hard to find its existence. It took a while for the soldiers to clean them up, and the scoring of the characters was also displayed in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The land of the curse of the gods, do not enter, you must die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the warning above Naf couldn't help but take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Difficult, is this... the legendary swearing and cursing temple?" He stepped back two steps and stuttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn and the definitive witch look at each other, "Do you know its origins?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just listened to what others said. It was already more than a hundred years ago..." Naf stared at the black hole and swallowed. "The local lord is not trying to stop the wolf heart from crossing the cage. Did people set up a lot of traps? According to legend, there was a team led by a knight who encountered a mountain rain when performing tasks. This kind of rain came quickly and quickly, and when people fell over, they could beat people, so the knight ordered to seek refuge. In the rain, the result happened to find a strange temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Roser raised an eyebrow. "After they entered, is it still inside?" Found the baby, the villagers were driven by greed, took the baby out, but they were cursed by the gods, and finally died tragically?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, you Have you heard that?" Naf was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Rother laughed. "The mortal really didn't grow much. I played this one hundred years ago. Now I still do it." I am willing to bet that this rumor was compiled by the lord - in order to swallow the wealth in the ruins. As for the poor worms, it is justified as a curse, one by one."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...they didn't die right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Rother frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guide narrowed his neck and carefully replied, "It took almost a decade for them to die, and the knight is no exception. According to legend, when they walked, they were extremely painful, and even the skin on their faces fell off, revealing a piece of rotten flesh and blood, which looked good, and this is also the source of the curse. In order to avoid the spread of doom in the territory, the lord ordered the prohibition. No one is close to the area, so no one knows where it is now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
