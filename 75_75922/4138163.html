			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland met with Isis Kant, the chief commander of the First Army and the General Staff of the General Staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How? The feeling of riding the Seagull for the first time?" He looked at the two subordinates with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back, look back, although it flies very fast, for me...may be too irritating." A rare look of heart, "I didn't think it was when I watched it, but I personally sat in it and found that it was really a bit swaying. Especially when going up and down, I always felt that the bottom of my butt was empty, and there was no bottom in my heart. "He said that he got up and took a slap in the face, and he gnawed his teeth. "Of course, I will try to overcome this. Please feel relieved!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... Is this a warrior with a slight fear of heights? Roland couldn't help but raise his eyebrows. "How are you going to overcome?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the war is over, I will watch the shadows as soon as I have time, until I get used to it!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really the style of the sand people. He pumped his mouth and turned to Itis, "What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northland Pearl licked his lips and spit out a word after a while, "Great "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then... is it gone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland waited for a while and didn’t wait for the following. He looked at each other with a puzzled look, only to find that her cheeks were reddish and it was difficult to blink in her eyes. The color of words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he sighed, and his subordinates are somewhat different from ordinary people in some respects. He had thought that he would see the expression of shock or emotion of the two, and then touted him to create such extraordinary things. At present, he thinks more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you are back, go to the conference room now," Roland stood up. "It's the final preparation for this war." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly six months of construction and advancement, the first on the fertile plains The main line of the railway is less than sixty kilometers away from the ruins of Taqila. By the completion of the construction of the No. 10 site, the First Army will be able to directly attack the enemies that are entrenched here. The manpower and materials invested in the Torch Program far exceed any military operations in the past four years. More than 80% of the steel produced in the furnace and kiln area has become orbital. The strategic purpose is only one. It is to sever the devil before the red moon falls. The possibility of the obelisk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the fertile plain is covered by red fog, it means that the devil can invade the mainland at any time beyond the desolate mountains. Not only will the front line be stretched, but the first army will also face Enemies no longer limited by distance, this is by no means an ideal start for a small number of disadvantaged humans. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, if you can preempt Takira, the devil can only choose the other two holy stone veins to grow the obelisk, while the Star City and Anglia The towers are closer to the northern end of the plains, and even if they build a stronghold there, they cannot directly threaten the four kingdoms. In this way, if you don’t say that the victory of God’s victory is in the grip, you can at least fight for humanity for four hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the gray fort in the industrial age, to what extent in four hundred years, not to be trapped in food, can be four hundred years ** A few times, the answer is self-evident. Therefore, the vast plain is both a strategic buffer and a reserve for future development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortal will eventually defeat the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it doesn’t mean that their generation can see the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a deeper reason why Roland has not told everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the facts are not always as perfect as the plan. According to the original idea, as long as the devils in Takira are eliminated, and the ruins are converted into fortresses, it is a success. If this is the goal, the current first army is only one step away from the complete victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
