			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland swallowed the last fried egg and wiped it with a napkin. "That's so much, you are worried that the witch will help her to hear that she is not dead." The news, will run over to save her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so, His Royal Highness," Barovton said. "They are in a hurry, they should be on the road. If the witch is dead, but now she is still alive! The madman is stealing even the baby, I am afraid that he will not let go of a degraded partner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Roland is a bit confused, he always feels that something is wrong. Why do the assistants of the minister and the chief knight think that the witch will be the enemy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman who is going to be hanged is a witch? It seems that the weight will fall when the wind is blown. If she has terrible power, why should she stand there and let him kill? No, she will not be caught at all. According to the church, she is the embodiment of the devil. In addition to the trial army, the mortal army will pay a heavy price in front of the witch. However, this devil was caught by the residents of Bianbu Town, and was tortured until it was sent to the gallows. The terrible power was not seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How was she caught?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that it was a landslide in the North Slope Mine At the time, she exposed her identity in order to escape and was caught by the angry villagers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought about it, um, this thing has an impression, right It happened when I crossed the day before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it exposed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...I am not very clear," Minister The assistant shook his head. "The situation was very confusing. It should have been seen that she used witchcraft."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland frowned. "You don't investigate this kind of thing." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, resuming production in the mining area is a priority," the assistant minister protested. "Half of the financial revenue of Bianbu Town relies on this iron ore." And the prosecutor also confirmed that someone died at the scene. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of witchcraft?" Roland came to the interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like being melted, the head and the majority of the body are spread out on the ground, reminiscent of the burning black candle," the other side looked disgusted, "His Royal Highness You won't want to see such a scene."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland puts on the silver fork in his hand, thoughtfully. Historically, most of the victims of witch hunting were innocents. They were used as venting tools by churches and ignorant people, while a small part of them belonged to themselves. These people dressed themselves in a strange way, throwing a variety of strange materials into the pot all day, claiming that they can predict the future and decide on life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they did figure out some of the doorways, such as using the flame reaction to claim that they have gained the power of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In modern times, this is a chemical trick, but at the time, it was easy to be misinformed as an incredible phenomenon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for melting people, Roland thought of the chromic acid lotion for the first time, but this thing is troublesome to prepare, it needs to completely soak the body, and the corpse effect is also It's a far cry from the candle, and it's even worse than other strong acids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how does the witch do this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she relies on alchemy, it is a rare chemist in the territory, if not...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought of it and made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take me to meet her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait...etc., Your Highness, Are you going to meet a witch?” Barov stood up in a panic and overturned the cup of unsalted milk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is the order." Roland turned back and smiled at the assistant of the minister. He really thanked the four princes for their unreasonable style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly paused when he reached the door. "Yes, I always wanted to ask, why is it hanging?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it hanging? Shouldn't the witch be tied to the stake to burn it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baroph's face is inexplicable, "Is it? But she doesn't Fear of the flames."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp; There is only one dungeon in Bianque Town. The poor land can't afford too many prisoners. Most criminals will face trials in a few days when they come in—or release, or kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the prince entering the dungeon, in addition to Barov, there are chief knights, wardens, prisoners and two guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dungeon has four floors and the walls are made of hard granite. Roland returned to this place for the first time. He noticed that the narrower the passage, the smaller the number of cells. Probably after digging a large pit of inverted cones, he used a layer of stone to climb up, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of rough engineering naturally does not have good drainage measures, the ground is damp, the turbid sewage is so flowing, down the stairs one step down Seepage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch is locked at the bottom of the dungeon, and every time he goes down, the stench in the air is even stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you are too dangerous to do so, even if she is trapped by the lock of God, there is no guarantee that it will be safe."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who spoke was Carter Lannis, the chief knight who knew that the prince had come to visit the witch and came over the first time to discourage him from stopping. Moreover, Wang’s order was ineffective for him—he refused to accept any instructions that ignored the prince’s life and wanted him to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long, cold and handsome male face, but what is it? Roland really wanted to sew his mouth. "Don't dare face the evil, how can there be courage to overcome evil? I thought you understood this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To fight evil, you must do your best, Recklessness is not equal to courage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is to say, if you encounter an enemy weaker than yourself, you can achieve justice. If you encounter a stronger than yourself, you should turn a blind eye?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Your Highness, I mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before I was afraid of the witch’s jail, now I am afraid to see a little girl, my chief knight is really unique."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many words, but they are not good at arguing. No power to fight. Taking advantage of this effort, the group has arrived at the bottom of the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a lot smaller than the above several floors, with only two cells in total. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head ignited the torch on the wall, the darkness faded, and Roland saw the witch who was curled up in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s late autumn, the temperature in the dungeon is so low that people can see the white air they breathe, and he wears a fluffy coat with a silk lining. Naturally, I don't feel cold. But the other party has only one single coat, and it can't completely wrap the body. The arms and soles that are exposed outside are frozen and bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden light of the fire made her turn her head and her eyes closed slightly. But soon, she opened her eyes and looked straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pair of pale blue eyes, calm like a lake before the rainstorm. She can't see fear on her face, nor can she see anger and hate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has an illusion, as if he is not seeing a weak girl, but is engulfing the shadow of the flame. For a moment, he felt that the light on the wall was faint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to stand up against the wall and acted as slowly as she fell at any time. But in the end she stood up completely and walked from the corner to the place where the light could be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just such a simple action, but let a group of people wait for the mouth to cool down, have to step back two steps, only the Cavaliers flashed in front of themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
