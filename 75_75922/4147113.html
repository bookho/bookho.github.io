			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Roland," the phone quickly passed a steady voice of the rock. "I didn't expect you to call me so early. Is there anything important?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the other person’s words, Roland realized that it’s only about seven in the morning, he’s a little embarrassed, “Hey... ...sorry, did you wake up? I have had some trouble and may need the help of the association - it has nothing to do with the demon, but it is really important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem," Meteorite said calmly. "Long sleep is just the inertia of the body. For the awakened person of my age, most of the time is squinting. What trouble, you will Just tell me directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, his performance in the eyes of the senior leaders of the martial arts association is extremely active, not only the most active against the demon, but also the result At the top of the list, there are only two less than the guards who led the team, and the Fijian-led star team. More importantly, compared to other martial arts, he has always acted alone. Such efficient annihilation efficiency has greatly spurred the old school, and made him faintly inferior to the influence of the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is the result of Roland’s attempt to conceal his record. Most of the fallen cores have been disintegrated and returned to the dream world. He never went alone to hunt and kill the demon. Every time he followed, he followed a large group of Taqila witches. In the face of all kinds of strange and eccentric abilities, the demon had almost no ability to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, all of the above expressions made his reputation spread quickly at the top, and now he can not only enter and exit the various facilities operated by the martial arts association, but also Equipped with a phone that can be directly connected to the guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before that, I want to ask a question first, what is the relationship between Prism City and Sanye Group?" Roland remembers listening to Garcia, his father used to Participated in the construction of Prism City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a nutshell, it’s a long-term relationship," meteorite replied. "Of course, we work closely with many companies. After all, the association needs a lot of operations. Resources."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, we are influential big customers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You can think so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good." Roland quickly said his needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." There was a rare silence on the phone. After a while, the other party was slightly hesitant to reply. "There is no problem with this. But... does it really matter to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same is true for the world." Roland said in the most sincere tone, even the nightingale When I came to the world of dreams, I couldn’t conclude that this was a lie—because if human beings were disadvantaged in the battle of God’s will, he would not escape. If that was the case, the time of the dream world would be solidified. Always frozen in the consciousness world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I know." Rock did not care more. "No matter what, the association thank you for your contribution. If you don't come forward, decide The younger generation will never be as much as it is now, and our situation will be even more difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the frank and honest answer, Roland suddenly felt Inexplicably moved, although the reason for his hunting of the demon is very different from the purpose of the association, the gratitude of the other party is real and unfalsified. Perhaps as he said, for them, the world is all true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to use the phrase "Nothing, this is what I should do" as an answer, but I didn't consciously become another sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I will guard this place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hanging up the phone, Roland first Sending the cleansing door out of the door—although she awakened the power of nature on the day she eroded the world, she still has to learn. Moreover, San Milan, Blossoming, Lingdu and Jieluo are in the same school, and they are not afraid of the demon to find the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he went to a Rose Cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the contact, the cafe has never been officially opened, and the shutter is always closed. Only when you enter the cafe from the side entrance of the warehouse can you see it. There is no hole in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
