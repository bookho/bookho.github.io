			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motor eventually stopped running on the afternoon of the fifth day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, a section of "Twilight One" can provide five days of power for a large electric motor, and if used intermittently, the working time can be extended. The copper column that loses the magnetization effect can be enchanted again, completely low-consumption, pollution-free, and recyclable green energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its shortcomings are also obvious, an enchantment needs to exhaust the magic of Anna, Mystery and Sper, even if the three produce a section every day. No. 1 ", also maintains up to five motors (without shutting down). Anna is still an irreplaceable figure in the town's fine processing and steel smelting. Although Roland has tried to take most of the manufacturing industry to the ordinary townspeople, there is no supply of machine tools and materials that Anna manufactures and maintains, and the guns and bullets. When the production of the goods is ready, it will immediately fall into a dry situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not to mention that the 152mm fortress gun, the new light weapons and their own ideas need to be realized by Anna, so he can’t accept the other person’s magic. The battery is charged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland leaned back in the high back chair of the office and sighed long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome this shortcoming, there is no doubt starting from two aspects. First, continue to improve the duration of the "Dawn One", which requires a much larger source of magic. , or increase the number of people entered. It is a pity that the magical channel light of the female marquis is very difficult to transport the magic of Anna. After completing the recharge, it is almost exhausted. I want to add more witches to power the mystery. This problem only allows Sper to adapt slowly - after all, during the period of being the lord, she probably won't concentrate on how to improve her ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is to replace other witches instead of Anna, compared to busy Anna, Soroya, Ai Gesha, etc., most witches I don't want to exhaust my magic every day. If I use the remaining magic to make a magnetic core, it is a feasible method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the total does not exceed the share provided by Anna alone, Speer should be able to stick to it - she said before that the magic channel is not one-to-one The transmission can completely connect multiple people at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland remembers this idea on paper. As for who has more magic, who has less magic, how much to use and how much to stay, can be handed over to the Witch Alliance. Go to statistics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty, which is trusted by everyone, is undoubtedly the most suitable candidate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving this problem, you have to consider how to use this new energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, it is possible to produce four or five units a month in the factory, and the steam engine that can be used for boiling water is different, which is limited by the number of "Twilight No.1". It doesn't make sense to make more terminal conversion machines. At the current level of magic, he estimates that the town can only maintain three to four terminals at all - whether it is used as a source of power, boiled water, or light, and wants the system to run stably. I am afraid that it can only be specialized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought for a long time, and finally drew a circle on the spotlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source of power, that is, the motor has more advantages than the steam engine, such as stable speed, easy to operate, easy to automate, etc., but the latter should deal with the current power The demand is sufficient. He also envisioned some tall electric equipment, such as electric cars that traveled to the Long Song Fortress and the town, or electric airships that could be controlled by ordinary people, but the price/performance ratio was too uneconomical – knowing to make these machines move On Anna or other witches stopped working on a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boiled water is even more so, boilers and firewood can be solved, even if it is more expensive to take care of the management, it is more cost-effective than the cost of magic, he has not been affluent To the point where you can squander your power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many meanings of lighting, not to mention that a stable and clean light source can greatly improve the happiness of residents, and also let them learn better conditions at night, not Everyone is willing to go home after a busy day and continue to read and read the faint candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the arrest of the legendary Thunder for the people to use, which is great for breaking the superstition and improving the scientific spirit. This is probably the most intuitive understanding of the application of electric energy, and even if the airship and electric car seem unbelievable, they are far from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
