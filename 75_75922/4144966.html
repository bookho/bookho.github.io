			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can be described as the most devastating week since he took over the Winter City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although all indications indicate that the Red Moon’s coming period may be significantly earlier than in the past, he has been doing this effort, but this difference It’s suddenly abrupt, and it’s still beyond everyone’s predictions – not the church’s decade, or Tachilla’s estimated two or three years, but not long after he’s just launched a demographic migration plan. Appeared over the western border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course this is not accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a week, there were urgent reports from other cities, and they all mentioned the changes in the sky. And without exception, no one observed the approach and movement of the Red Moon. It seemed to be hanging there, but it was covered by the sky and invisible. Now it just uncovers the piece on it. Blue sky only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland found himself suffering from a slight "red moon syndrome", that is, whatever he is doing, he will intentionally or unintentionally find a window hole where the sky can be seen. And it is easy to fall into a state of daze when looking at the Red Moon. The red glow of the circle is so huge, but it is not glaring, and it can be clearly seen in day and night. Staring for a long time, he even has an illusion that the Red Moon is watching him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Federation, the red moon is the beginning of the war of divineism, Roland has been preparing for this, but when it really comes He gave birth to a feeling of unreality. The fertile plains are still quiet, and the investigation team sent to the north has no response. Only the winter city has not been affected. The Executive Office sent a report every half hour, but it has nothing to do with the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty," the sound of the nightingale interrupted his thoughts. "You look at the sky again."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland blinked and returned, "Oh--sorry, I just can’t help it--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale flashes over He handed a piece of dried fish to his mouth and interrupted his second half of the sentence. "You don't have to apologize. In fact, there is nothing wrong with being in a daze. If you are too tired these days, just take a break. Do you want it? I will accompany you to watch the moon? Since the red moon is related to the gods, it is also a kind of research to look at the two eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was laughed out, can The fish is so eloquent, probably only one night. He licked the fish fillet and shook his head helplessly. "There are still many things to do. Continue to supervise me, can't deliberately release water, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The night licked his mouth and slid back to the sofa on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland takes a deep breath and pulls his attention back to a large stack of reports on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days and months make trouble for no winter city, even more than the devils that have hit thousands of miles. According to the statistics of the Executive Office and the Security Bureau, there were four fires and 16 crimes in the winter city. In addition to the eight work-related accidents that were learned from Anna, a total of 21 people were killed and more than 500 people were injured. Among them, 90% of the casualties occurred within 24 hours after the emergence of the Red Crescent. The most chaotic moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Roland thought it was the panic of the people that caused it all, but when the situation gradually came together, he noticed that things were not so simple, so the appointment The joint group conducted further investigations and the conclusions were quite surprising. Aside from the accidents caused by panic, the magical fluctuations brought about by the Red Moon are the real culprit in this chaos. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigation file submitted by Ai Gesha clearly described the situation at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 5:35 pm, the red moon suddenly appeared in midair, and the magic equipment that was working in the winter city was affected to varying degrees. influences. For example, the drama of the "Destroyed Dust" is being changed, the illusion is almost the same as the real scene; the lighting in the industrial area is instantaneously overloaded, the bulb is completely blown, and the machine part driven by the Dawning No. 1 is used; the most serious accident occurs. In the first factory of the machinery, an old-fashioned boiler exploded on the spot, and the hot high-pressure steam rushed all the surrounding workers to the ground. After the investigation, the boiler was limited by the manufacturing process, and important parts such as valve valves were cured by candlelight. The furnace body had been hidden before, but no one noticed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
