			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland only felt an indescribably cold and shrouded whole body, and sure enough, he was targeted by someone - in this dream that was supposed to be illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and swept the people around him from near to far--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, who is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinker? entrepreneur? Awakened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet hall is still very lively, people enjoy this social gathering, the only abnormal, as if only himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took a deep breath and let the heartbeat of the cockroach slowly calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement... can't mean anything else, the sender of the message should be the same person who left the note in the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rose Cafe, No. 302."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, someone wants to see him . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means has surpassed the scope of the power of nature - the martial arts are not witches, they are not known for their abilities, and the awakened have more power. , speed, body five senses, cultivation to a certain extent can also put the cyclone outside, resulting in a spell-like effect, but in general it is biased towards the type of combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, he didn't feel any natural fluctuations around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the trick to make the word appear is likely to come from a more advanced force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream world is evolving into an unknown area and may be related to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really... it’s being stared by the NPC," Roland whispered. As a world that will completely stagnate once he is awake, it is really difficult to relate to reality. In addition to the alien witch and the defeated by the singer, he subconsciously believes that the rest of the world should be the fiction of the dream, no matter how realistic, and lack of the key "self." But now, there are "fictionalists" who noticed his differences and took the initiative to send him a message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did it start? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he borrowing books from the Association from Garcia, or did he find in the reflection church that the characters more than 800 years ago were exactly the same as those in the dream world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or earlier than these, for example... the moment that Jie Luo pulled him into the soul battlefield? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't think of an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you know it doesn't make sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is what the other party wants to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland?" The voice of Yann interrupted his thoughts. "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...nothing," Roland returned, smiling and shaking his head. "I will come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He confirmed the glass After nothing has happened, put it on the nearest table and walk to the witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is delicious and smooth! Just wait, you can try it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;San Milan handed a string of freshly baked foie gras, a tempting oily scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked down in her direction and couldn’t help but cover her face. I saw that the three witches were kept in front of the three meals that needed to be cooked, and the food that the chef had just cooked was not in the hands of the land, and there was a stance that “this place has been occupied by me”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men around are okay, no one will go to grab the food from the little girl, the lady is quite a bit complained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is this bringing people?" "It looks so cute, how to never eat good things." "Look at their clothes and shoes, wouldn't it be secretly mixed in?" "Oh, feeling hungry." For hundreds of years."...etc. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing these complaints, Roland wanted to ask them to converge and swallowed back, turning their heads and glanced at the group of people behind the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, they haven’t tasted the food for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't forget to bring some to your family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing the foie gras skewer handed to him by the witch, Roland reconnected to the previous idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the other party has such ability, why not talk to him in person? Have to be so awkwardly arranged, like a guess? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it scared to scare him, or is it lacking some opportunities? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is even, the words in the wine without warning, I am afraid to go directly to the heart is not good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the latter... he couldn’t help but recall the contents of the note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The day of God's life, when the meeting is agreed...?" Roland whispered a few times in his heart, and suddenly he couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. It’s hard to be--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side refers to the real world, the day when the red moon comes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of the Red Moon also means the beginning of the battle of divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only at this time, can "deliver the message" be able to talk to him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...how do people in the dream world know about things in another world? Be aware that as long as he does not dream, here is always in a state of solidification! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the most speechless thing is that even if the opportunity is the same as his guess, the location is still a mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost knows where the Rose Cafe is in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t choose the place to be in the tower or a famous landmark! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Roland was secretly licking his belly, the middle-aged men of the two bosses walked past him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that your golf course is about to start?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a while The approval took me a lot of money. Why, Gao is always interested?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I don't usually exercise, I am looking for you." The master is more interested. Listen to others saying that you have asked him to name more than three million?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No way, please be auspicious. Do our trip I only hope that the wind will go smoothly. If the money is spent, I can earn it again. It is said that the name he has set is very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rhine Greenfield, just in line with the Green Leaf project of the Sanye Group across the river."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha...that’s quite good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but sigh a little, then the two said something, he I didn’t listen to it at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name... is your own! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been letting the witch secretly look for the Rose Cafe, but ignores this point - if you open a cafe, is it called Rose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other person sincerely wants to pick him up, he should not choose a place he has never heard of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
