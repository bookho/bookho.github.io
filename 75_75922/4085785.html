			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the leaves were explained, Isis first raised the question, "Your Majesty, this kind of wheat catalyzed by magic can really be eaten by ordinary people." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the problem that most people care about most. After the opening of the North Pearl, not only Pei Luo, but even Speer revealed a pair. Worried look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, there is no essential difference between Gold No. 2 and Gold No. 1, which are cultivated by leaves." No. 2 only expands the characteristics of production. Roland smiled and replied, "Secondly, although it was transformed with magic, it does not contain magic, so don't worry that ordinary people will be harmed by it. In fact, I recently ate porridge and Pancakes are all from the gold field of the experimental field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't help but think of the future of natural food, hybrid food and genetically modified food. Some people always emphasize that nature is the best, but they don't know what natural food should look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To explain in detail the origin of the Golden No. 2 is a very complicated problem, it involves the mutation and inheritance of the creature, even the leaves may not understand the truth. . Although her ability can make great changes in plants in the short term, it basically needs to continue to supply magic power, and can not be passed on to future generations. If the change is too large, it will even die directly after the supply of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the main role of the leaves in cultivating golden wheat is to promote mutations and accelerate their growth - the selection of properties is more conducive to planting, eliminating inferior shapes , from generation to generation, eventually formed a wheat species with outstanding characteristics. This is no different from traditional crop cultivation methods. The only difference is that the process has been greatly reduced. In less than two years, the long evolution of hundreds of years has been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has seen the appearance of the original watermelon - a fist-sized hard-shelled fruit sac with a few petals of yellow flesh, which looks similar to orange . In the seventeenth century, the flesh became red and the size was much larger, but more than half of it was filled with whitened meridians. If you use a spoon to dig it, I am afraid that it will be hollowed out under four or five. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the fruits and crops that people are familiar with are very different from the previous ones. In fact, not only plants, but animals are no exception. The most typical example is a dog—a pet that did not exist, but was transformed from a wolf under the influence of human generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the so-called natural foods are the results of repeated artificial screening. If you return to its original appearance, it’s hard to find a mouthful. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not just humans, any species, ranging from mammals to microbes, are constantly changing the environment around them. In Roland's view, it is natural for humans to make a power station and yeast fermented bread, because life itself is part of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that these reasons are too esoteric for local officials. He simply simplifies the answer into two parts: “Gold No. 1 eats nothing, No. 2 is fine.” And "I don't believe, I am eating too." The example of the king of this era is the best proof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that there are no more doubts on the surface, Roland goes on to say, "In addition, food transactions in various cities must be controlled by the secondary city hall, just like Like Winter City, it is forbidden to sell food privately. As for the specific implementation method, the general manager Barov will explain it to you in detail later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count of Speer Passy I picked my eyebrows. "Your Majesty, if the gold No. 2 really has such a high output, I am afraid that there will be a large surplus after the people are fed. If the City Hall wants to buy all of them, the financial pressure will be very large. Moreover, it is only in the Longling City. More than 10,000 people need to produce so much food?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes, because the excess food is not used for food, but for storage. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Storage?" She gave a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the upcoming battle of God." Roland said one word at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of his forced promotion of the Golden No. 2 is to remove the population for the Grey Fort, and the other is because of the war that determined the fate - as born in peace As a member of the age, he has not experienced a protracted cruel war, so he can only prepare for warfare according to historical experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
