			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the madness and fearful beasts of the landing were wiped out one by one, the chaotic situation was gradually controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha turned around the artillery position and could see the corpse of the broken behemoth everywhere - I have to say that the goddess of witches is in short-handed In this case, the combat efficiency is unparalleled, especially after the equipment is equipped with a special new firearm. If there is no support from them, it would be frustrating to rely on the Witch Alliance to deal with these more than 30 fearful beasts, let alone guard against the madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just like smashing enemies with large caliber shotguns, they seem to prefer revenge in ancient ways. Ai Gesha has seen more than one ancient witch in the opponent's loss of resistance, put away the firearms, replaced with a knife, a sword or even a fist to make a final blow, as if bathed in the flesh of the devil can make them feel consoled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the long wait of four hundred years has indeed changed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil probably can’t understand why a group of male humans can beat them down, and both strength and speed are better than them. This unknown will undoubtedly bring fear, so when the last two mad demons, the other party almost gave up the resistance, and was finally controlled by the swaying typhoon, and also used the spear to shoot an attempt to solve the problem. similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement artillery has now entered the position, and the four guns that have been smashed by the beasts in the melee have been re-established, and I will soon be able to join again. The ranks of the enemy. And the fastest-recovering, always-fired fortress gun, every shot has become an inspiring horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much is the enemy left?" After the crowd gathered, Ai Gesha asked Zoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"16, if they don’t have new reinforcements." Zoe looked at the sky, "the loss of flying beasts is nearly 70%, regardless of their purpose. What, hitting this one has failed. Now that it is not retreating, it must be brewing the final attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The last attack?" Ai Gesha could not help but frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid the firepower of the machine gun, the remaining devils have all risen to the height, even beyond the scope of the spear, and want to be close to the artillery position again, the risk will undoubtedly A substantial increase. What's more, at this time, everyone is ready to do everything, even if they eat a spear, they can keep the loss to a minimum. Since the failure is a foregone conclusion, how to see the retreat is the most reasonable choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You used to be a member of the Detective Society and rarely participated directly in the war, so you may have a little understanding of their habits," Zoe explained calmly. "The adult beast that can fly freely is a more precious individual even for the devil. It can be played so much at a time. There must be a superior commander in these demons. For such devils, the mission is always placed. The first one, if they fail to achieve their goals, they would rather die and not retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If so, why doesn't it start from the beginning? Down?" The wind and the wind couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it didn't find the right opponent," Zoe showed a weird smile. "If there is an extraordinary witch between us, it can't be said long ago." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it is due to their nature," She regained her gaze in the air. "The killing and fighting, the brutal and brutal, even more and more like humans, can't change this... If it weren't for this feature, Nataia and the Queen of Stars could not be in the Devil's Army. The opportunity to fight with the high-order sorcerer and the ultimate breakthrough is superb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the enemy is not the first because of the enemy Time to join the attack, and then refused to evacuate because of responsibility? Let's not say whether this inference is correct or not. It is impossible to be a general person to be able to express the three-seat promotion experience so straightforwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha couldn’t help but say, “In the era of the federation, you are...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Isn't Pasha adults told you?" Zoe smiled. "I was one of the shadow guards of Nataya, and the "red lotus" in the holy army. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
