			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure you read it wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the iron axe heard the news, face There was a rare look of surprise, and he and Itis looked at each other and both sides could see the shock in each other's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, Tilly was quite hesitant to tell the first army commander without discovering the truth. After all, this move is close to miracles. If the devil can really do this, it will inevitably have a negative impact on the morale and confidence of the top, and it is not surprising that the unwilling life is surrendering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is absolutely nothing wrong with you," McMillan patted the chest. "I and Lightning have been to the continental spine. There are no such peaks.咕!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning then nodded slowly. “It’s not something that the devil has come up with, we can’t assert at the moment, but at least one thing is certain, it’s It was only there in the last half month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that..." Itis thought, "This way I can It makes sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you believe it?" Tilly was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought that it would take some time for the other party to digest this information, and then arrange for the next observation to confirm, I did not expect that Northland Pearl seems to have accepted them. The saying - to know that even the three of them saw it with their own eyes, it took a lot of effort to reach a consensus that "it is not an illusion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s blame to blame Roland." Itis sighed. "If it was three years ago, I would have thought of this as a madman." Proverbs... But now, no matter what happens, I don’t think it’s impossible. If I have been in a small place like I used to, I can’t realize that the world has changed dramatically.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, the unreasonable action of the devil is equivalent to confirming this." She paused and briefly told Hill Fox's information, "The city of the nobility did not The way to accommodate so many people, a floating land is not necessarily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Devil...tolerate humans?" Lightning surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not without precedent. Does Aegis not say it? In the first battle of the gods, some humans also formed a 'alliance' with the devil. I'm going to deal with the witch together." Itis shrugged in disapproval. "At that time, they were afraid of the power of the witch, but now they have changed to the power of Roland. They are not willing to accept change, nor will they be willing to be Part of the change, then what can be done is very limited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They did not take the warning of the war of divineness seriously..." Tilly refused Live clenched fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." Itis showed a strange smile. "Even if the nobles know that it is true, it is still possible to make the same decision. War The end is likely to be in a few years or decades, but the abolition of the aristocratic powers and the recovery of the land is what is happening now. For some people, this is no different from the life they want, one is to die immediately, one It’s better to die later, of course, the latter is better.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay," the iron axe reluctantly interrupted. He knows that once the North Pearl enters the taunting mode, it will not easily stop, and it is easy to accidentally injure others, even themselves. "It's still a matter of business. The key is how do we deal with a flying land?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis's look returned to normal, "No, we can't handle it." If it is just staying on the mainland spine, if the thing really moved from other places, we will be in trouble. It can be observed by the highness of Tilly, hundreds of kilometers away, and its volume will probably exceed Our imagination - do you think that the Skyfire alone can destroy the corner of the mountains?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must tell your brother as soon as possible." Channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too," Isis nodded. "This has nothing to do with strategy and strategy. The only thing that might come up with a solution is only Roland squatted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the new communication tower is still under construction, otherwise according to the installer, this thing will allow us to immediately talk to you. The iron axe immediately went to the desk and lifted the pen to start writing. "No matter what, let's use the flight messenger to send the message back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
