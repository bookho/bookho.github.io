			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland draws a piece of draft paper from the table, roughly calculates the average age of the residential area and temporary residence, and concludes that there is no average winter city resident The age is between 40 and 50, while the latter is only about 35. From this point of view, many problems can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, the growth and decay of average life expectancy is a long-term process, and the living standard of Bianbu Town is obviously not much better than those of the displaced. In just five years, the life expectancy of local residents has been raised to a level, and Nana Va and Lily are undoubtedly the greatest heroes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can get thousands of data in two days. Do you not need to look at it all the time?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, if the magic is sufficient, she can see the numbers of everyone in the field of vision at the same time." Wendy whispered back, "but she seems to have I haven’t done this before, and I haven’t tried my own limit. She feels that her ability is a curse, even if she knows nothing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s like A little bit of watching people around me go to death." Night sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curse? Nothing other than bringing misfortune? Roland thought without a doubt, it was a big mistake! When a country develops to a certain extent, any decree may have far-reaching effects. The management of the brain-shaped villages obviously cannot keep up with the changing rhythm of the situation, and the statistical significance comes from this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary, observe, track the changes in these statistics, and adjust the details of the decree in a targeted manner, it can be said that any organization that wants to enter the threshold of modern times must The indispensable ability, and the change in life expectancy is one of the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is recorded through conventional means, it will not only require a sufficiently sound grassroots department and manpower, but it will take several decades to persevere to achieve initial results. - After all, no one knows how long he can live before people die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, apart from the absence of the Winter City, other cities have just had a secondary city hall that can enforce the decree, and the staff members are both Often, not to mention the need to refine the demographics of the community and the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the information of residents without winter can be improved to the present level, and it is also inseparable from the book. When is the staff of the Executive Office affluent enough to be literate? When people are decentralized to the grassroots organizations such as the neighborhood committees, it is said that they have truly met the requirements for moving toward the all-powerful government. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Momo can help the Grey Fortress to skip the time accumulation phase directly, and in the absence of anything, initially set up a statistical system, the so-called no rice But that's it – it's just the case that she only knows a little about her ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until Wendy finds out the specific meanings of those colors, such as the impact and extent of diseases, hunger, environment, etc., a large and detailed database. It can be easily obtained. Not to mention that this data also has a predictive effect. As long as it is used properly, this ability can bring benefits to almost every aspect of the kingdom's operations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf-hearted aristocrats simply don’t know what they missed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Roland, Momo is already a glorious executive member - and later said that it is also a ministerial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, is Nana's treatment time scheduled?" Roland asked on the record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wynti nodded, "This is today. Would you like to go see it together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hospital can be said to be one of the busiest areas in the city, especially after the war. Nanawa Pine is no exception. Although she does not need to stay in the lab for a long time like Anna, the daily treatment is scheduled. It is said that it has been discharged to hundreds of places and is still increasing. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also related to her ability and characteristics. When performing amputation treatment, it consumes all the magic power for about a quarter of an hour, so that the lost part is more than one slap injury. Those who do not accept the application for the time being, but instead issue a disability certificate as an alternative. After Nana's adulthood or ability evolution, the magic has grown dramatically, and these injuries can be cut into the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
