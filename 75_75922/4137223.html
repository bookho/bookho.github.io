			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Terry's Her Majesty...power is not flying, right?" The nightingale muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, although the flying magic stone can also make her fly, but carrying such a heavy weight will not work," Roland looked at the unicorn hovering overhead. The beast replied, "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I heard you say many times, drawing and testing the internal combustion engine are always watching you, but When you witness it, you will still feel incredible... People can really fly like birds by virtue of foreign objects.” The nightingale is with emotion. “It is just a combination of metal and wood.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really just metal and wood, but it’s our own to combine them together,” Roland smiled slightly. “Hands, magic, and cognition...so also Can't really be called the power of foreign objects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone - can fly like her?" Nightingale whispered, "including me too ——”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, everyone. Also includes you.” Roland is sure. The sky is no stranger to the nightingale. She took the overheated balloon and took the wheat stubble, but before the free-controlled flight, those were obviously nothing. Even the magical nightingale is still the case, let alone ordinary people without special abilities? The charm of traveling the sky, since the moment people looked up to the sky, they are already deeply trapped and unable to extricate themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pioneer of the Wonder Club is the best interpretation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty minutes later, the Unicorn landed steadily on the runway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you feel?" asked Roland, who was running over with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This plane is awesome!" Her eyes glowed. "In terms of feel, it’s a lot more flexible than the Seagull. Really. ... Although Wendy's ability to control the wind is not bad, but it is always difficult to fully match my intentions, and this is different. Speed, pitch, and deflection during flight, every detail is in my control, It can be said that it is a heart and a heart, like a hand and foot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃...A heart is like a hand and foot? Roland couldn't help but feel shame. Although the Unicorn is based on a large number of mature biplane designs, it is essentially a technically flawless prototype with test components. Controlling the rudder surface relies entirely on hand exercises, and the high speed depends on the feeling. It is a huge improvement to fly smoothly. If it wasn't for the aircraft to know the truth, and listen to Tilly's description, he thought that the other party was driving a four-degree telex, with a flight-controlled computer-assisted modern fighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably this is big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So... satisfied?" He waved to the hangar supervisor, "Come here today-"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about, brother," Tilly interrupted. "How could it be satisfied in thirty minutes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you fall down..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To tell you. You still have a lot of work to do, aren't you?" She waved her hand. "Go, don't guard me here, I still have a lot of flying methods to try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at each other's interest On the back, Roland shook his head helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aircraft did not fail at the beginning, it has reached the expected level, according to the level of Tilly, should soon be familiar with the new characteristics of the unicorn. Plus, she can get out of the plane at any time, and she really doesn't have to stare at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you are being dismissed." The nightingale was heartbreaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's a lot of words," Roland gave her a blank look. "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nightingale smiled and grabbed him into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just returned to the castle hall, the guards greeted them, "Your Majesty, The third side of the city said that the task you have explained has basically yielded results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
