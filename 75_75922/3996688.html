"No, I am Say...who knows if you are telling the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he felt his left shoulder being gently rubbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, this matter is true, I have evidence to prove it," the chief bowed. "But it can only be shown to you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the astrologers heard this sentence and consciously got up and left the room. Roland thought for a moment and nodded to the witch and the guard. "You should go out first."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the nightingale will still stay with him as the last line of defense in case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diffuse Star Bachelor walked into a hut next to the hall. After a long time, he took a tin box and returned to the long table, and respected the iron box. The land is in front of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The instructions of your ancestors, he had long expected This happened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland said: "Do you mean...turn off the astrology?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty, this kind of thing is not the first time," the bachelor said with a smile. "We are not equal to the alchemy and the sages, but they are not equal. Bringing a generous income to the kingdom, and we need to invest a lot of gold dragons every year to buy high-quality crystals and hired craftsmen, and there are very few outputs. In order to avoid future generations who want to save the cost and dissolve the astrological association, Your ancestors engraved the will and asked no one to violate it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland opened the box and it was a stack of gold in the eyes, it seems In order to preserve this order, the Wimbledon family really did not hesitate to work hard, and chose the extremely stable gold as the book base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He poured all the gold pieces on the table, roughly counting the number, a total of eight pieces, each about three millimeters thick, two palms in size, in the hands Heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first piece of writing is the original words of the chief astrologer: "No one can interfere with the astrological staring starry sky, where there is a manifestation of the destiny of the world. Mystery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter half of the sentence caught Roland's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the association itself is very strange - if astrology is really effective, Wimbledon III should not be replaced by the church without any precautions. Instead, the high priest was hanged early. Moreover, even the bachelor of the Stars mentioned that the astrological star "has very little output"...that is, he does not regard divination as a product, and his helpless expression is completely different from the gods who first met with him. If the two are judged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the ancestors spent a lot of money and manpower to build such an organization, and at the same time fear that future generations would shut it down without any prophecy, and they would not hesitate to engrave On the gold piece. Roland doesn't believe that the other person is an astronomy enthusiast who is keen on the stars, or he has set his sights outside the planet in the wilderness stage. Obviously, astrologers have a task that has nothing to do with divination, and these ten ** are related to the latter half of the sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he rummaged through the gold piece behind him and didn’t find a description. It’s a record of some of the basic methods of astrological association history and observation of stars. The principle of crystal lens enlargement is also engraved on one piece. The ancestors of the Wimbledon family seem to have been the chief astrologers here, and they also mentioned a higher-ranking controller. However, Roland reviewed the family history a little and found that there is no such content in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the first short book and pointed to the last half of the sentence. "What does this mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...not very clear," the bachelor shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, Roland felt the right shoulder was smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but chuckle. "Listen, the rules are dead, and the people are alive. The order left by the ancestors is when he is alive." Probably correct, but the times have changed. I am not bound by the rules of a few hundred years. Now I am the king of the Grey Fort. I want to do what I want to do. Do you understand?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
