			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These rails are the last ones today," the leaves slid out of the canopy and "have trouble you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Package on me!" Morrier patted the flat chest and then whistled. "Come out, my servant Momota!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a blue sphere emerge from the void and quickly expanded to the height of the tree. It stretches out the transparent limbs of both hands, picks up the rails piled up on the ground, and swallows it into the stomach - but the track is too long, and it is not realistic to want to completely swallow it, so the front and rear ends are exposed, 乍At first glance, it looks like the sphere is pierced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Momo...Tower? I remember you last called Momoka."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Morrier snarled. "But that doesn't matter. The important thing is to shout it out - so that is it imposing?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," the leaves thought for a moment, "Is the mystery month telling you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, how do you know?" Curiously asked, "She also invited me to join the detective group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the release of the shadow, Luo Jia shouted for the incarnation of the wolf for the younger sister The heroic posture of the enemy has left a deep impression on everyone. Afterwards, the Detective Troupe promoted the slogan, and the ability to display the slogan at the same time sneaked into the faint fashion of the young witch group. It’s no secret that there is no winter city, but Miss Ye’s long-term expectation is in the fascinating forest. The latest appearance was still on the throne of the King’s Majesty. She can also know so clearly, it’s quite unexpected. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because...no, nothing." The leaves coughed twice and turned to look at the direction of no winter city. "There is new material entering the forest, I First passed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Molly wanted to know the answer, she tried to push her own curiosity and waved her hand to the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter turned into a flashing spirit and blended into the shadow of the tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that this ability can make the other person appear at the other end from the fascinating forest. As long as it happens in the forest, there is no leaf to know. And thousands of trees can also be the foundation of her absorption of magic, which is why she can control the continuous flow of building materials to the front line, and the efficiency of the magic servant is not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power of evolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know when I can be like Miss Ye, Molly enviously thinks that there are almost four or five months to come to No Winter City, literacy or something. There is no problem. After learning the natural principles, should it be her turn to evolve? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She climbed the top of the magic servant and controlled Momota to walk outside the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the forest, a busy scene of a hot day suddenly appeared in front of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One, two, three, up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the left!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slow down, slow down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly a thousand workers are heading northeast On both sides of the extended railway, the tower zero station was repaired in a tense and orderly manner. As the first stop to the ruins of Takira, it actually has the role of sheltering the forest terminal. The four bunkers are located at the four corners of the station. They are connected together by the shackles and the retaining walls. They wear various clothes and even the workers who are wearing the upper body. If you don’t know the plan of your Majesty, you can’t take it here. Associated with the front line of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, isn’t this Miss Morrill? Hard work!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today I have to bother you, the train crew is really busy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Morel, there is a steam engine here, can help us to correct it. OK?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Molly's main task is to prevent the Seagull from accidents, she is very happy to lend a helping hand whenever someone asks for help - just like when she was sleeping on the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly feels happy when he sees others laughing and thanking themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes her feel happy is that only the witches and very few fjords on the island will thank her, she can help except for loading and unloading goods. Not much is busy. Here, everyone treats her like a celebrity. The place where she needs help is everywhere. It’s just a thank you to have more happiness. As long as the seagull can’t fly, she will take the magic servant along the railway. Last all day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the tower zero site, the scenery along the way has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke columns are looming in the view of Molly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the trace left by the train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that these steel behemoths are the main force to replace the leaves, they continue to transport the materials out of the forest, transported to the forefront of the need to build, as if never felt Tired in general. The rails she carried were only a small part of the rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, listening to His Royal Highness, these big guys are not so easy to make. There are only two or three cars in the winter city. This is also the need for the Seagull. Frequently commuting between no winter and the front line: Regardless of the war in the fertile plains, the production must be maintained in the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer to the end of the track, the more uniformed the soldiers were wearing uniforms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week of observation, Moryl has been able to roughly distinguish which are recruits and which are war-torn warriors - sitting on the ground to listen to the instructors, still from time to time The sneak peek at her is generally the former, and those who concentrate on wiping the arms in their arms and turning a blind eye to her are basically the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look carefully, this is the current form that the devil knows!" An instructor knocked on the picture on the small blackboard, "the most common It is a madman with a burly body and a large arm. He can throw extremely accurate bone spears, but he can't throw them continuously – unless he jumps to the wall!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haha..." There was a sneer in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Laughter fart!" the instructor scolded. "When you really see that scene, I am afraid that you will be scared of urine. This time, both escape and surrender." Can't save your poor life, the only correct way is to align it with the trigger and kill it before it kills you! Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes!" everyone answered in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the next one," he pointed to another picture. "The monster whose eyes are on the forehead is the fear of the heart, although the number is far behind. The last one, but the ability is much stronger. As long as they see you, they can make you afraid of being unable to move, only waiting to be slaughtered by the enemy. This strange mental attack can be restrained by the stone of punishment. Those who go to the front line will also issue the god stone, but they will not be allowed to lose their days and meet them without the stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pray to your grandmother, or imagine some favorite people or things in your mind. In short, how do you overcome your fears? Do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing this sentence, Morrier found that someone looked at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she smiled and blinked at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, where are you guys looking!" the instructor shouted. "If you don't want to attend classes, just roll me to the construction site and smash the cement!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man quickly retracted his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哎, so it is more flattering than a veteran or a recruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly grinned and controlled the magic servant to move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
