			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the gunfire exercise is much better than what Roland expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a great miracle. In the last round of explosions, 70% of the total amount of black powder was detonated in the ground, causing the momentum to be no less than the next generation. Roadside bomb. When the subcontract was buried, he also had a whimsy. He mixed some aluminum powder into the gunpowder. As a result, the fireball's light was more brilliant. At the moment of rushing out of the ground, there was even a few sunrises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explosion also basically declared the transformation of the First Army’s weapons from black gunpowder to chemical gunpowder. As for the distance of the third-level sun, he can only Fantasy in the head. Although uranium is not low in the crust content, even higher than silver and gold, it is not difficult to decompose granite by Lucia to collect uranium. But deadly radioactivity is always a difficult problem, and lead plates cannot Be sure to be foolproof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most critical thing is that he is not sure whether Nana Va can treat radiation sickness, which is the biological matrix distortion caused by particle ionization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at the time of life and death, Roland is not going to open the epic task of "scrapping radiation" as much as stealing the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, that stuff is too dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finalizing the meeting of the Taqila witch, he invited Tilly into the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time to talk about the gambling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give her a cup of chaotic drink, Roland cleared his throat and said, "About the previous hunting competition..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although Ai Gesha is indeed a witch alliance, but it is not a winter city team," Tilly seems to have long guessed Roland's mind, her eyes bent into a crescent "Brother, this bet can only be said to be a draw. If you want to count Miss Yeh into the Wintertown team, I will not admit it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of course, this bet is indeed a draw, but I still want you to stay," Roland said frankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This straightforward statement makes Tilly slightly stagnate, "呃..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So, for the sake of a win-win situation, how?" He was the first time to see the five kings showing such an expression that they didn’t know how to pick up the words. I have to say that there is still a feeling of sympathy. "I took out 30% of the income of Chaos Beverage to set up. Funds, rewards for those who have no contribution to the winter city - whether it is a witch or an ordinary person, are within the scope of the reward. And you settled in the winter city, whether it is living in the witch building, or living with the sleeping island migrants "That's all together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After talking about the matter, Tilly quickly recovered from the sorrowful god, and she pretended to cough twice as if nothing had happened, "just 30% What we agreed at the beginning is 50%."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I estimate, even if 30% will reach an amazing value, take it As a bonus, it’s enough to enjoy a lifetime.” Roland explained, “The rest of the money will be spent in no winter city. Designed to include witch homes and necessary facilities, as well as payroll. In general, they are spent where they are most needed. If you need it, you can also withdraw it directly."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you use the earned Golden Dragons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, you are just taking up space in the warehouse," he said. Thought it was. Later, when precious metals currencies cannot keep up with the demand for productivity growth, credit currencies will emerge. At that time, the money will become a simple figure for the government, and it will be printed directly. It is meaningless for him to save money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly snorted. "It sounds like a good exchange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So It’s called a win-win situation,” Roland asked slowly. “What do you think?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed. “Since your brother, you’ve said this. Now, I can only promise it." Although it looks like a helpless answer, the unspoken smile in the corner of her eyes indicates her mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but smile. From the letter of doubt a year ago, to the relaxed smile now, Tilly probably finally believes that he can bring comfort to the witch. A stable life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
