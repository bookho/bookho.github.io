			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Tower 9 site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joint warriors and decision makers who have been busy for more than a week without winter have finally returned to the front line command post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it is not a true front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha noticed that on the map marked with a defensive circle, the railway frontline was almost approaching within fifteen kilometers from the ruins of Takula. And the five kilometers are divided into green "safe areas." The area nearly three kilometers ahead of the ruins, there is a bright red, which is obviously the most vivid change in a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are finally back," Miao Xiaochen Guanglin. Hilter rushed forward and greeted everyone with a standard military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the army and the staff also stood up and greeted with joyful salutes, presumably to see the return of the heart, everyone’s eyes were relieved Look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This easy also makes Aisha a little relieved, and the same laughter, at least means that the "dangerous area" that suddenly popped up is not Threatening the entire torch plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good job, it seems that everyone has not been idle for a few days." Iron Axe nodded with satisfaction, then went to the map and knocked on the map. "Felling, you report the situation, is the devil getting reinforcements?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, adult." Xiaoxiao Chenguang replied, "That is the enemy." Digging out the trench."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ditch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The earliest discovery of the other party’s movement is Miss Ervi, part of the devil climbed out of the red fog, and began digging six days ago. Later, Miss Light confirmed the situation and noticed that the devil was in the ditch, so it was marked as dangerous. The area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axe and Itis, Ai Gesha looked at each other, "War?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We also think so, because according to the hand drawing of lightning, it looks very primitive at first glance, but its general arrangement is very similar to the trench in front of the first military position. The front and rear transverse grooves are separated by ten to several tens of meters, and there are many longitudinal grooves connected.” The film booth spreads a rather scribbled drawing in front of everyone. “The biggest difference with us is that the devil used The longitudinal grooves that are gradually retracted are more, and basically all on one line, the deviation is at most two meters, so that the whole appears to be more regular."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They Learning humans." Ai Gesha can't help but whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the rumors before the first war of the gods are taken as facts, it means that after nearly a thousand years, the devil once again imitated humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a bit interesting," Itis pondered after sketching. "Those vertical grooves may not be used for retreat, but for offense." "Well," the iron axe agreed. "Hiding in the ditch can indeed reduce the chance of being hit by shrapnel, but they are not able to fight against the fortress." Weapons can't change the situation with only a few trenches. Only when we break into the first army position can we hope to win."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So they only repaired the longitudinal ditch So close?" Film also quickly reacted. "If you are together, you can really shorten the time of the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then how should we deal with it?" ?" Ai Gesha asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing needs to change." Northland Pearl sneered twice. "When they dig into the range of the artillery, let the Heihe fire on. It is a waste, but it is a waste. His Majesty prepared enough ammunition for this decisive battle... I would like to see if they can smash the trenches in front of us with gunfire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The iron axe looked at the film. "Is the railway construction work going smoothly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy’s counterattack is a lot more intensive, but the damage is not too big. The latter reported that "the madman wants to approach the position is almost impossible, so they rarely mobilize the ground forces again. The attack is mainly based on beasts. But from the number of one to fifteen Look, the fearful beast that can still fly in Taqilali is estimated to be running low. If there is no high-level devil cover, we can leave more fearful beasts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
