			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty woke up and found that the whole night of heavy rain finally stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She yawned and rolled out of bed, pushed open the window, mixed with muddy air into the house. The garden washed by the rain is green, and the drops of water falling from the olive leaves near the window can be seen. The soft morning sun shines on the wet grass, reflecting a little light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a new day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put on her bra and coat and went back to the bed and took a photo of the nightingale’s cheek. "It should be up."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale made a fuzzy nasal sound and twisted his face into the pillow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only at this time, she will not hide in the fog, and she will be exposed to herself without any precautions. Wendy smiles and shakes her head. I will go to breakfast first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale’s ears shook twice, looking like an unconscious trembling, but Wendy knew that the other had heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the door lightly, she went to the bathroom to wash it, then went to the lobby to have breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chef always gets up very early, and everyone's food is ready before the day is bright. The firewood in the stove will burn for a long time, so don't worry about the meal cooling halfway. If you want to eat anything, just take the bowl and spoon and go to the kitchen to take it. You can say that this is a self-service style. It seems to be a very common way of dining. For her, this kind of life can be called luxury. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in the club, Wendy never thought about how much I could eat if I could eat it one day. The food is always in a state of shortage. As for the taste, I don’t have to pay attention to it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here, there are three or four types of breakfast, porridge, toast, dried fish and fried eggs are the most common foods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if she has been living in the castle for more than a year, she can still feel a sense of happiness and satisfaction every time she eats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is gratitude to the witches for all that the sisters can live freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy came to the restaurant with the bowl, the hall was empty, and there were several used tableware on the long table. Obviously she was not the first one. The people who came here - the Witch Alliance never specified the time to get up every day, so everyone came to enjoy the breakfast. Like lightning and wheat, I always leave the castle first, followed by Anna, Aisha, Lucia, etc., and she is the one in the middle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest nature is the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that you are very fond of sleeping late. When there is no major event, it is basically going to get up to the government when the sun rises to midair, and the nightingale is infected. Wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she was the most cautious and keen person in the club, she would be alert to a little bit of wind and grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unexpectedly, Wendy felt that this was not a bad thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breakfast, she came to the first floor of the Witch Building - it has been Transformed into the office of the Witch Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just entering the building, the bell immediately greeted him, "Wenty sister, you are coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Welcome, Wendy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, grown up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two other young women from the City Hall were enthralled. They all graduated from the school originally founded by Karl Vabert. They were half a classmate with Anna and Nana, and there was almost no prejudice against the witch. The older ones are called pearls, the younger ones are called gray rabbits, and Lucia's sister bells, the three form the first clerk in the league office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, since the bell is not yet fourteen years old, the word "temporary" must be added in front of the post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
