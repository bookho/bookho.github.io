			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Broadcast] Pay attention to the "starting point reading", get the first hand news of 515 red packets, and the students who have not robbed the red envelope after the Chinese New Year, this time you can show your skills. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher Master!" Seeing Hakala fall, the witches wandered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Idiot! Keke..." She licked the wound and only felt that the lower body had completely lost consciousness. "Come, go kill me and kill the traitor!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the nightingale has already brought Wendy together and broke into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the fork, she saw that Wendy’s forearm, which was in a coma, had turned black, and the venom was spreading gradually, and he could not hesitate any more. She bit her teeth, picked up the other's sleeves, tied the arm with a cloth strap, and then pulled a handleless dagger from the sole and forced it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a quarter of an hour to cut off Wendy’s entire arm, take off her robes and wrap it carefully, then pull out two straps and tie them behind her back. . As long as he can return to Bianbu Town alive, Nanawa can make this broken arm intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... can you really go back alive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took me three days to come here alone, and it would only be slower to carry people. If she walks fast, if she accidentally slides down the trail, she will not be able to climb up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty’s arm is still bleeding out of blood, so it won’t last for three or four days, but the nightingale has no choice, she can’t leave Wendy alone— - The other party is injured for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Need help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the sudden enquiry, the nightingale is almost simultaneously The fog, posing a defensive posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she is empty in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be nervous, I don't want to fight with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night lifted his head and found the other person Floating in the air, "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is lightning, it is not long before I join the club. I run outside every day. It is normal for you not to know me." "She smiled easily with a smile. "But I know you, the famous nightingale, the killer in the shadow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hakala sent you ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, don't misunderstand," the lightning fell slowly, one foot on the ground, "I want to go with you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night suspicion that I was wrong, "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said, we should have freedom The right to choose my own way of life," she paused. "I chose to be with you, it was as simple as that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For...what?" The nightingale was already Completely disappointed with the support society, even Wendy can not finish Believe in yourself, and in front of the girl - she really was a child, the age of approximately fourteen years old, and Na Nawa similar. A refreshing, short blond hair with a sleek look and full of self-confidence. She did not wear the robes issued by the Co-sponsor, but a set of easy-to-action long-sleeved trousers, plus a leather jacket with pockets and patches, old and invisible, and finally with the waist. The thick belt from where you came from, it looks like a man's dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you are talking about it, the black machine that snoring and snorting, the water can turn into a gray-gray powder, and there is a thunderous explosion. The snowy mans of the loud noise, I want to see." She said first, "I am determined to be an explorer, of course, to go to interesting places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What is the reason for this... The night is over, it doesn’t sound like it, but the consciousness is telling myself that the other person is not lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand... Since you want to be an adventurer, why do you want to join the club?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Not an adventurer, an explorer!" Lightning emphasized, "I am different from those who take money officers. It is an adventurer, but it is nothing but a dirty wolf. The explorer only For the sake of interest! As for why I joined the club..." she said with confidence: "Isn't it a great adventure to find the holy mountain? But Hakala does not understand the spirit of adventure. She is completely addicted to the ancient book. Anything found on the way is closely related to the content recorded in the ancient book. What Shihmen rose from the ground is just two weathered stone pillars. If so, she will never find a true holy mountain. An explorer must honestly record everything he sees. It is not something that the explorer should do according to the map. This is what my father has repeatedly stressed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
