			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he arrived at the front of the position, he did not need a lookout mirror to see the group of refugees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both men and women, different ages, ragged clothes, slow pace, weak body shape - look at the posture is not a trial army, even ordinary militia Not as good as it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail is more convinced of his judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also knows that the church has a secret medicine that can instantly improve its strength. Considering that the other party is likely to use the maddening pills, he lets his teammates in heavy machine guns. In the suppression range, the barrel was set up, and he shouted in front of himself. "This is the border defense of the Grey Fort Kingdom. It is forbidden for anyone to break in! Now stop now and stay in place, otherwise we will open. The gun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of people apparently saw him, and their faces were full of excitement, not only did they stop moving forward, but they accelerated their pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail opened two shots in the sky and repeated the warning again, but it didn't work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nail, come back!" the veteran called behind him. "They don't know what the musket is. You don't stop if you yell at the throat." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail has a heartbeat, and quickly changed the shot in the call to an archery. This time the comers finally reacted - but they only slightly hesitated for a moment. After that, he continued to move toward the position, and this time he waved his hands to the First Army and yelled while running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shout is very noisy, he can only tell that it is asking for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, stop!" The nails made the final attempt until they were dragged back to the line by their teammates - when the group crossed the first row of stakes The two bunkers blew out almost at the same time. The bullets smacked across the top of the nails and fell around the stakes, igniting the blossoming snow pillars and completely drowning their shouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front of the crowd suddenly raised a bloody fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time they finally stopped moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail saw that in addition to the swept refugees, the rest of the people continued to fall down, and the five bodies cast their bodies in the snow, despite the fear, But they did not flee backwards, it seems that there are more terrible things waiting for them in the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! Stop! Don't shoot!" The nail took off his coat and risked being hit by a stray bullet. He got up and waved in the direction of the bunker. Let the machine gun team release the trigger. Probably noticed his strange move, and two squads left the bunker area, surrounded by the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the position still filled with smoke, a five-person squad raised the rifle and slowly approached the stranger behind the nail, while the latter Trembling, even if the snow is chilly, they dare not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't hear the squad leader's question!" the veteran said. "If you don't answer, then the spies are all hung up!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big, big, big...adults," this time someone finally opened his mouth. "I, we are all from Hermes."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you are a church believer?" The nail frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes... No, no, we are not," the man whispered again and again. "We used to be deceived by the church. Now we have lost our way!" The gods did not protect the church at all. It is our fault. Please give us some food!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this sentence was spoken, it suddenly caused in the crowd. Awkward, "Adult, I beg you, a porridge is good, my child is going to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church's army is chasing us behind, we I have to lose my bag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they would rather be fired by machine guns than to escape? Looking at the other side's dry face and more than a dozen corpses with blood, the nails flashed a bit into the heart, after fleeing the holy city, I am afraid that it is their only way to live. He touched the dry food in his waist pocket and was about to throw it at the group, but he was caught by the veteran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give them food."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are sure? These guys are church people," the veteran stressed down, "is our enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "But now they are not already - have you not heard? They admit that they have been deceived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, cheating?" veterans disdain "When you can't live, they will even believe that the devil will be a true God. These guys are nothing but the wall of the trial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Head, Sang Shu is right, maybe the weapons and armor used by the church army are created by them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ghost knows Did they have the blood of the First Army in their hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s purely a matter of mixing, who will let them fight against their majesty? I don’t want to Give them food "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail took a deep breath and made a quiet gesture to the teammates. "Listen to me, when you are not coming to the town, what is the situation in the town?" It should be clear that at that time, everyone was not more or less deceived by the church. But we didn’t give up on us, and we didn’t regard us as a wall. Should we cast aside them now? Of course, I am not saying It is the right thing to let those who have committed crimes first give them food and then bring them back for interrogation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Roland’s Majesty once said in the book that the Grey Fortress Kingdom is a whole, as long as it is a sinless person and willing to return to the Grey Fort, then It should be regarded as the king's people, not persecuted to exclude them." The nail said in a breath, "If there are innocent people inside, and we see death and death, is it against the will of your majesty?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene was silent for a moment, the veteran grinned, Nail head, I count you know why Blair was elected captain of adults, read the book is not the same, but the critical moment before you say no, then smooth man, iron to know it, you will certainly applauded. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that he did not agree with the remarks that "the people who voted for the Grey Fortress are all for the people", but the first army went up and down. Respecting Roland Wimbledon, he is naturally reluctant to resist the nails. "But you can't throw the food directly to them. It will only cause looting, pick out a few that are hard to hold, let them line up. Lead it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more and more soldiers coming up, responsible for commanding the Northland The garrison’s deputy battalion’s “Eagle” also rushed to the front line – the tall man with a rounded, pointed face resembling the Western Grey Eagle, and the first hunter who joined the militia. Who can explain, what is going on here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail went up a military ceremony and briefly stated the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Escape from the Holy City?" After the eagle heard it, he showed a thoughtful look, then asked his men to bring a refugee to the front. "What happened to Hermes? If you can tell the situation one by one, I can let you fill your stomach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big, adults..." The refugees swallowed, "The Cathedral of the New Holy City... collapsed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The nail could not help but Oh, even he has heard that the Cathedral of Hermes is an immortal symbol of the church. Before the "miracle building" of His Majesty was not completed, the Tongtian Tower was the tallest building built by man. At the beginning of the Cold Wind Ridge sniper war, he also dreamed of following the squad into the Hermes Plateau, occupying this legendary tower that can reach the sky. But this magnificent building... does not even exist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
