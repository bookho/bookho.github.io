			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solidified light resumed the flow in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new influx of sunshine, God made the invisible hand that caught the radish no longer indestructible, but twisted and softened like a bubble. The dazzling blue light descended from the sky, replacing the faint silver light that the little girl used to resist - losing the interference of the gods, even if the other party is just a new awakened consciousness, it can't easily win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, two new figures rushed into the blocked field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It did not find Ipsy, but saw another goal that needed to be eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is also the main creator of the world, Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delta waved his other hand and squatted toward the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the dust is not raised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power has disappeared from the air, as if it had never existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of meters away for the sprinting martial arts, but between the electric and the flint, Delta can not make a next step, they are crushed by Roland The mask caught the astrolabe straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how struggling it is, you can’t get rid of the other’s palm. If it’s only in the face of Jielu, its ability is only greatly weakened, in front of Roland It is completely ineffective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not fair--!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its consciousness begins with the stripping of the chart Scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland is unmoved, he knows that whether it is pure magic creatures, or these enemies from erosion, the key is the rotating star in the body. As long as it is forcibly pulled out, they will be like ice and snow under the scorching sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the body is cheering, as if welcoming the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, Roland still did not sort out the ins and outs of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than half a minute from Wakiris, he received a call from Fiji, but there was no word on the other side, the only thing he could hear. It is a noisy and harsh collision and friction. When the phone was interrupted, he saw the change in the direction of the city suburb through the sightseeing elevator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A weird translucent cover will wrap the high-speed bridge inside and outside the city. This is by no means a technical means. What's more, it is inevitable that the star martial arts family will not even be able to explain the specific circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drove the car out of the underground garage, and happened to meet Wakiris in the same direction, so he took the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, after breaking the "hood", he found that Jielu was also among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the geek wearing a mask and robes is obviously a member of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even if he didn’t sort out the ins and outs, he did not hesitate to choose to kill the gods first—the association has been looking for the whereabouts of these invading enemies, but always Without reliable clues, they are now appearing in front of themselves, and they are trying to start with Jielu, and he will naturally miss this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the moment when the astrolabe was completely stripped, the beam of light rushed straight into the sky, covering him all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, this scene of deja vu came again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Roland!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of his eye, he saw the face of Jieluo full of tears . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is comparable to a reassuring gesture, and the brilliance of the sky will engulf everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, even if you resist anymore, it will not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s better to relax and focus on the rushing consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘶...嘶......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field of vision quickly becomes blurred, countless Snowflakes flew up and down to form a black and white scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the snowflake film, there is also a whisper of sly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Compared to what I told you, what you personally realized is the real answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the light gradually became dim, and he finally saw the sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can’t help but swallow, seeing an endless darkness In the void, a huge red hollow is hanging - it has no thickness, but it is as wide as it is. Judging from his position, the size of this hole may be measured by an astronomical unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More distant places are flashing countless spots of light, they are mixed with snowflake pieces, can not tell whether it is the real thing, or the illusion caused by blurred pictures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Roland’s memory, there is only one thing that can be compared with such a scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Black does not mean no light, and the void does not mean nothing, but it is too large. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some insignificant parts of the spot that are often inexhaustible, but it is a negligible part of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Universe." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This span... is really unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but groan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it was enough to see the legendary bottomless world for the first time. I didn’t expect this perspective not only not to shrink, but to expand to a new one. On the level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is, assuming that the scene he is seeing is really the universe he understands, what is the connection between the two fragments? Is it that the "crowding" of the bottomless light column to the Scorpio civilization has actually been sent into space? In this way, the word upgrade is also quite suitable. No matter whether it is a radioactive or a stickman, it is not like a species that can survive in a strange environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since flames and sharps can injure them, they are not much better than humans in their ability to withstand temperature and pressure. However, when the "upgrade" occurred, those radioactive people who entered the light column did not seem to be prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No...No, he quickly denied this speculation, so the interpretation is too far-fetched, purely a speculation that the two fragments are forcibly linked together. Nothing else, it’s hard to say why it’s just a matter of guiding the gods who guide it all. Whether it is the endless war of divine war or the fragmentation of evolution that does bring evolution, it is not like preparing for this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This must have a more general meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Roland noticed something squirming under the red hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if influenced by the thoughts, the field of vision began to magnify as it moved - when he noticed that there were many scattered meteorites floating beneath the cavity. It is like a piece of debris scattered by the stars, and it seems to be like this. It looks like a ruin of ruin. With his knowledge, it is difficult to tell where these things come from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these gravel are like the force of traction, gradually approaching a special stone in the center. Under the layering, the volume of the stone becomes larger and larger, and each time a new gravel is received, it will cause a drastic change in the surface layer. At this moment, Roland suddenly wondered, although these floating stones seem to be both fine and fragmented, but I am afraid that every volume can not be underestimated, so this aggregation will be so earth-shattering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
