			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explanation is somewhat far-fetched, but Anna and the book have not been able to check for more problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waking, he is at a normal level regardless of body temperature, breathing or pulse. Even Roland himself is very strange, and there is no sign of dizziness, as if suddenly Cut off the consciousness, the road from the north slope to the castle is completely blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the inspection process, he also learned from the book mouth that the situation was fainted at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several people heard Annaâ€™s voice, but did not witness the scene that he fell down. At the moment when Roland lost consciousness, the nightingale would pull both of them at the same time. Into the fog. After Anna came forward to explain that it was just an exclamation when she almost slipped, and she covered the matter with horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for where the King went down, everyone is not particularly concerned. After all, the power of the nightingale has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and it is almost impossible to hurt Roland from her hand. So as long as she is guarded, Roland does not need the guards to accompany him at all times. Besides, the King of the Grey Fortress does not need to inform them. In the case of a successful radio communication test, it is normal to take the first step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, only Anna, the book, the nightingale, who stayed by his side, did not even know the other members of the Witch Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Roland finally got relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have to say that Nightingale made the right choice at a critical time. Now the entire gray fort is tied to him, and there are strong enemies outside to fight, and the upper and lower levels must be highly consistent in order to kill a bloody path in the battle of divine. If he falls down at this time, it will inevitably bring about unsettled factors. Even a short coma can make people feel uncomfortable about his physical condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to deal with this is when this has not happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Roland smiled at the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter did not take the opportunity to take a few bottles of chaotic drinks as usual, but low and low, "No, this is nothing... you are fine." Ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eating the meal from the kitchen, the time is just after 8pm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland intends to go to the office to modify the design of the next fire, but Anna returned to the bed on the grounds that the patient was taking a good rest. In desperation, he had to follow suit, and even with the cancellation of the night's dream journey - after all, this sudden coma made him also a little guilty, before the tragedy caused by long hours of overtime, it is not a bad thing to rest more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to good night, the three went out of the room in turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door was closed, the house was suddenly covered by the night, leaving only the faintly visible city lights outside the window, reflecting the small gap in the curtain cloth. Block glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a quarter of an hour, Roland heard a rustling sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this quiet, windless bedroom, the velvet curtain feet swayed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around, and a black shadow appeared in the window, blocking the only light source. The shimmering light behind the figure outlines a thin silver edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of scene makes people feel inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sat up and said without hesitation, "Can you tell me now, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black shadow went to the window and revealed the beautiful curly hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know that I will come?" She groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will not be like this in normal times." Roland smiled and shook his head, took the glowing magic stone from the bedside table, put it into the light trough, soft Huang Guang suddenly illuminated the entire room. "Your expression is just like writing your thoughts on your face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
