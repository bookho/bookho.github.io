			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two stayed warm for a while, and the ashes noticed a pile of jewel-like gadgets placed in front of her, curious, "What are these?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on," Tilly patted herself on the side. "I will show you something interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash crossed her legs and sat down, seeing her wearing a white silky glove on her hand, with a crystal ruby ​​embedded in the back of her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...tracking the magic stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly did not answer, but laughed Suddenly, he reached out to the open space. Suddenly, a flash of lightning jumped from her fingertips, hitting the ground, and screaming in the air. Then a blue smoke rose from the ground, leaving a slap in the position where it was hit. The size of the burnt black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy can't believe his eyes for a moment, "Do you... have new abilities?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Tilly Wimbledon is the mortal, the magic acts on itself, and the performance on her is extraordinary intelligence, it is impossible to release it like a normal witch. And the electric light just means that she has a new ability - and the witch can't have two main abilities at the same time, which is common sense that the sisters understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly took off her gloves and handed it to ashes. "Not that I have new abilities, but this stone." She curled her lips. "It's it." Changed the way the magic works, so that the magic shows a completely different effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash is stunned by the gem in the center of the glove, she is shocked, she knows Tilly Will not lie to her - this means that non-combat witches can also have combat capabilities, the ability of the witch group to resist foreign enemies will be greatly enhanced. "How much is this stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only one," Tilly seems to have guessed the ashes. "And it's not so easy to use. You Try it, imagine the magic as something that actually exists, let it fill the stone, and then release it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy contemplating for a long time, no A trace of electric light appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you understand?" She laughed. "We are still the mortal, and we can sense the magic in itself. It is even harder for other witches. It needs I have tried and understood. In fact, I have looked for a lot of people to test. About two or three of the 100 people can quickly comprehend and release lightning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you laughing at me stupid?" Ashes took off the gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost," Tilly picked up her eyebrows. "At the time I only used it - 唔-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes kissed her, so that she could only swear a little low... After the separation, the latter took a long breath, "Okay, it’s not too stupid."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about other stones?" The gray sorrow licked his lips, and only in front of the five kings, they would completely relax. "Do they all have different abilities?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a different performance," Tilly corrected, leaving a blush on her cheek. "It doesn't make ordinary people have a witch-like Ability, only magic can excite it." She paused. "This made me have a question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What question?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the magic in the end." Tilly’s slow emotions, one sentence at a time, explained, “The witch’s abilities have been varied for a long time, showing extremely high inaccuracies. Sexuality is different in the perception of the mortal. But this strange stone completely unifies the magic. Any witch can release the same ability through it, so I probably thought of the wrong direction, magic. It may be an omnipotent force in itself, and the witch has only one form of expression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about these magic stones?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can only be released, but it is impossible to gather magic. It is not clear whether they are artificial or natural," Tilly said regretfully. They are all excavated from the remains. At present, most of them have been displaced by the people. I can collect only so... I heard that there is an ancient relic in the east forest of Haifeng County. I really want to go inside and see it. Maybe you can find more news about magic and historical faults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
