			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is sitting in the office and listening to the information sent back from the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver...嘶...The city has put down the suspension bridge...hey...we are...going into the church...oh..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it, pay attention to safety." Nightingale replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that this is the limit distance," Roland spread the map and put a circle in the position of Silver City. "To be directly with the East and North." If you want to contact the two borders, you must set up a transfer station here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he has listened to the prints, he has been addicted to this kind of life in the distance. With a sense of well-being, the high communication of the message made him seem to return to the previous era. At this moment, he was sitting in the command hall, monitoring every step of the entire combat situation. It’s a pity that listening to the prints is not infinitely spread. Too far, the sound is difficult to ensure clarity and stability. It now appears that at least one transfer is required to bring the order without the winter city to the whole country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the number of prints is not enough," the night smashed a dried fish. "You only made four pairs in total, and it was used only for tooth extraction." Half, it is not easy to catch another devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem does exist, the seal can only spread the sound in one direction, if you want to achieve instant communication The effect of the witch is at least two groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s already very efficient compared to flying messengers or manpower delivery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the seal is not ineffective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Ai Gesha, its quality depends on the magical intensity of the blood of the fusion, such as Anna’s listening notes, the communication effect is better. If you add the blood of the high-level devil, maybe a group can cover the entire gray castle kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘶...something is wrong...and so on..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi is intermittent The voice rang again, and this sentence made the two people in front of the table suddenly refreshed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a pure person?" The nightingale swallowed the fish, "Is it still a magical black hole?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; The former is okay to say that direct positioning and firing can be done, and the latter has two possibilities - one is to wear the gods of the gods, and the other is the gods who are not afraid of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...hey...I didn't see the stone...the reaction..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No god stone?" Roland frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...nothing in the church...nothing..." The voice paused for a moment, "We...into...hey...the basement is empty too ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two face each other, the church is... escaped? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not impossible," Roland said after a while. "I was too cautious."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in the kingdom can stop the pace of the First Army, the nobles are not willing to take the initiative to hit the gun, but it does not mean that the grass among them will not secretly report to the church - after It is also normal for the person to evacuate the city with materials in the absence of victory. Different from the Dragon Monument, the aristocrats who have not been devastated by the disaster are likely to watch the looting. They are estimated to be in the churches of other cities shortly after the attack on Chishui City. The pigeon of the god of punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you split up at the beginning and send three teams to attack three cities, you might be able to get them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't say that," the nightingale handed a piece of dried fish to Roland's mouth. "After all, you can see the enemy ambush only one of Hilli, in case On the tough, pure, the scattered army is likely to be hit hard, and there are prudent and cautious benefits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
