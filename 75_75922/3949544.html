			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermes Cathedral, Tongtian Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become the new Pope’s Maeen quietly listening to the reports of the three bishops in the Chamber of Secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the old bishop Teflon, the two newly promoted Archbishops Soly Dar and El are from the trial army and the arbitral tribunal, the former is a The brave and good commander, who has accumulated a high reputation in the military for 25 years, the latter is the adjutant of Heather, and the predecessor's position has been expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The orphans in this year’s eternal winter have been very successful, and the aristocrats of the great cities have all fallen to the church. The number of people who have arrived at the old holy city has exceeded Three times the scheduled plan," Tefron said with emotion. "This is also the only good news recently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility is like this, when the situation is not right, It is easier for them to drink than to drink water. Mayn nodded. "This is only the first year, and there will be more and more in the future. If we can occupy the entire continent, the number of people accepted each year can easily fill a new city."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope so," he sighed. "The snow has fallen so far, have we encountered several mass attacks by evil beasts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Six times," Sorley replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Six times... The defense line has fallen more than a hundred trial warriors," Teflon said in a somewhat heavy tone. "There are ten deaths of the gods." And in the coming year, the offensive of the evil beast will only be more fierce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s easier than fighting the devil," El said. "Although I haven't seen how powerful the devils are, I seem to describe them in incomprehensibleness. I said, is it really necessary to die here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean by this!" Soli's brow wrinkled. "The gods have instructed us, and have given us strength. As believers, we don't stick to our faith, but we have to turn and run away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t fight," Mayn knocked on the scepter, and El worked with Heather for more than a decade, and also smothered his temper. Looking at the two men, he couldn't help but think of the old partner of Teflon and Heather, looking at the old bishop and discovering that the latter is also looking at himself, and seems to think of the same scene with him. "Our ultimate goal is to continue humanity, and to achieve this goal, there is no alternative to defeating the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty, "The two bowed their heads respectfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he himself is not sure whether he will be able to defeat the devil in Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the entrustment of Oberlin, Mayn felt the heavy shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell fears have already appeared, and the devil will swept in five years. He will witness this battle of gods in his lifetime, and he will not be like Like Brian, the task is entrusted to the next successor. Whenever I think about it, it makes him sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he also thought of leaving a back road for himself. After swallowing the black sail fleet of Garcia, he did not order the burning of the ship, and all the insurgents were hanged open, but they were all held in custody. In addition to a few leaders and a large number of slain ghosts from the slums were pushed to the execution ground, most sailors are now in the permanent winter harbor, watched by their most reliable men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the line of defense falls completely, the fjord is the last refuge - even if it retreats to the straits of the island, it means that you will never be able to turn around, at least yourself. Can spend the rest of my life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, humans have tried their best to try twice, and have not beaten their opponents, aren’t they? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the discussion about how the church should develop and stabilize the doffering rule, Mayn didn’t listen much, and when the three men negotiated, he was absent-minded. "Let's do what you said, today's meeting ends here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow, sire." The three bishops got up and walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean leaves the Chamber of Secrets and walks to the secret area with the guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
