			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone quits, the nightingale is out. "Has half a month of free time? Didn't you make this decision two days ago?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care about those details," Roland pretended to be nothing. "If I don't say that, do you think she can agree immediately? If Luojia disagrees In this case, the script can only be replaced by Joan, and the latter can't communicate properly until now. Only in the face of lightning and McMug will they be relaxed, even if Mey is to be instructed, it will be useless. So I Speaking so solemnly, the other party is not easy to quit... This is one of the skills of negotiation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, even if you are right... ..." The night screamed and whispered, "But why do I think that the reason she promised is not this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what are you talking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, nothing," she whistled and stuffed a piece of dried fish into her mouth. Is it really not a problem in the South China side?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shrugged and didn't go any further. "If it was before the big migration, it might be a It’s quite unfavorable news. After all, no one knows what life would be like in Bishui Port at that time, but it’s too late for the conservatives to think about it again. It’s a testimony that the flaming patriarch will write to Luo Jia. Since they choose to stand on the opposite side of the people, they are destined to look down on too much wind and waves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two places of Canglongling and Bishuigang, there is a station Five hundred recruits, but he does not intend to use this part of the force to penetrate the desert. As long as the notice is still in the South, Brian, the latter should know how to deal with the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stage of persuasion and display power has passed, and now that there are people who want to destroy order, he does not mind letting the opponent taste the taste of dictatorship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that such a small thing is not worth the effort, and Roland turned his attention back to the time stamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil moon has been here for more than half a month. If it was in the past, the focus of the work without the winter city has undoubtedly shifted from building expansion to defending the city. This does not even require more publicity, people have been gearing up and ready to fight the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the strange thing is that the entire northwest is silent, not to mention the large-scale mixed herd, and even the sporadic evil beasts are hard to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning once flew to the Hermes Plateau, and the same was true there - the flag of the Grey Fortress, the nun They came back and forth to carry bricks and repaired the new bunker. The chilling garrison also entered the line of defense. At the end of the snowfield, there was a blank, as if the fertile plains were frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some discussion, the ancient witch gave the conclusion that perhaps it was the devil that blocked the invasion of the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s reasonable to think so – although the ruins of Takira are just a small spot in the plains, the behind is the devil’s complicated red line and the outpost. I am afraid that those evil beasts have long been cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the peace of the border is a fact, coupled with the impact of heavy snow, the construction progress of various projects has been slow. In this era of extreme lack of entertainment, a little bit of leisure will be multiplied, and the witches who are obsessed with playing cards and banquets every day can know how serious the situation is. After the victory, the most taboo is to relax comprehensively. In order to keep the city alive, and to find ways to release the magic power to the witch, the idea of ​​filming the film came into being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of time stamping, Roland has seen it in the reflection church of the old holy city. Its completely immersive picture and presence is almost like a 3D photography that crushes the afterlife - in a sense, it is a reappearance of the scene, before the virtual reality technology breaks through There are irreplaceable application values ​​for the prints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an ordinary stage play that will make the city people look good, and change it to be a realistic three-dimensional movie. What will it be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Mey heard the idea and experienced the stamps brought back from the old holy city, it’s not so difficult to understand the excitement. It is. For them, this is definitely an epoch-making initiative. If you can leave a figure in it, it will be remembered by the entire drama industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
