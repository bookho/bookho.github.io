			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in summer, the snow and ice on the Hermes plateau did not melt much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean stood at the top of the Tower of Heaven and looked out into the distance. There were only two colors in the wilderness outside the wall - green grass and white snow intertwined, like The scars left by the earth after the battle of the evil moon. This climate can't grow any crops, so the food needed for the new holy city is all transported from the foot of the plateau, that is, the old holy city is transported by animal power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been in Hermes for more than a decade, he has become accustomed to this ubiquitous cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only this time we have two people left?" Tefron pushed in. "Can the meeting not be held in the secret room?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you like to be bored in that small room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... Of course not, The old bishop touched his white beard. "If it wasn't for Heather's old rules and regulations, I wouldn't want to exchange information here every time. Even if she swears, I can at least appreciate the scenery of the holy city." And..." He smiled a little. "I didn't expect people like her to be punctual. Will this be overdue this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" She had a tough thing," Mayn sat back to the table. "Maybe she is already on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe..." Teflon Pouting, "You really shouldn’t help her find a reason. Anyone should say something, this is what she often hangs on. If you are in trouble, you should report it to us first. She is not alone in the Yongdongwangdu, sending a messenger to play with her fingers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't take care of her," Mayn Pushing three letterheads to Teflon, "We are in trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trouble?" The latter squatted and sat down across the round table. Spreading the letter, "All bad news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," he took a deep breath. "It can't be broken any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefron puts a smile on his face and begins to look at the first secret letter carefully. "...the spread of the evil spread is stopped, the whereabouts of the faceless are unknown? What is the epidemic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The latest research results in the secret area, you don't need to know too much, understand a disease that can be quickly transmitted," Mayn Simply explain. In fact, according to the master of the crow's eye, it is a kind of miniature evil beast. After special cultivation, it produces a variation specifically for the human body, and the holy spirit medicine that restrains it is also a evil beast, but the body shape is even smaller. "The source of the disease cannot be directly observed with the eyes. The conventional means can't be cured at all. There is only one kind of person who can stop the spread of the evil spread."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witch?" Teflon I quickly thought of the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And there is more than one." He sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the letter, the old bishop slammed on the table. "What is this idiot doing? Let the mice go to encircle the mercenaries and say no, no face." Did the person fill in? Did he know how important this pure person is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His idea is not wrong," Mayn frowned. "If there are no people in the letter, a thousand mice are enough to eat more than a hundred mercenaries. But the other party seems to have a powerful long-range arrow that can be continuously launched. For this, I remember being stationed in The Tyro priest of the Long Song Fortress also mentioned that the reason why the Duke of Ryan was defeated to a group of miners was because the other side's bow was extremely powerful. Although the sturdy armor can greatly reduce the damage of the scorpion, the mouse does not have Such equipment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if he wants to use those dross, it should not be easy to send a faceless person!" Tefren was angrily, "This is Heather. I am afraid that I will be furious, and I can grow into a witch of pureness, and it is extremely rare. Force, training is also extremely energy-intensive. In a sense, they are even more valuable than the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But whether it is a witch or a punishment The ultimate goal of the army is to destroy the enemy and win the victory." Mayn said slowly, "There is a loss in the process of use. It is inevitable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want to save the priest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Heather may not think so," Tafron shook his head and opened a second letter. "Don't forget, the church's arbitration is the responsibility of her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will explain it to her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, the old bishop turned over the stationery in his hand and did not dare to set the channel: "Tefico's militia Sneak attack on the long song fortress church, and then kill the messenger group? Is he crazy??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the second letter actually comes from two aspects, One is the report of the fortress agent Pei Luo, and the other is the information of the local believers. On the whole, there is indeed a militia team from outside the West who sneaked into the fortress and looted the church. They not only take the maddening pills themselves, but also the drugs stored in the church... So the first point is not to go wrong. This team is not from the new king Tiefko, or from the clear water queen Garcia. In contrast, it is clear that the former is more likely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the latter point, Mayn always feels a little weird. If you follow the report of Pei Luo, the other party will immediately withdraw the fortress after burning the church. How did you intercept the members of the messenger group? At this point, the corps should have arrived in Bianbu Town, and the two could not meet it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taiwan quickly realized this when he saw Mein’s words, he picked up the first letter and read it again, on his forehead. The wrinkles piled up into a gully, "Don't... Roland Wimbledon, after removing the messenger group, pushed it all to his brother Tefco Wimbledon?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We might as well speculate," the archbishop said after a moment of silence. "Roland intends to obtain this cheap population, so he assigns a witch to treat the evil and transports the fugitives back to the West. Before this, in order to avoid being told by the messenger group that he was raising a witch, he sent a knight to attack the messenger camp, so that they could not even release the pigeons, and then pushed the responsibility to the fortress attacker. After all, the agent was supported by Roland. It’s a matter of course, to assist him in making fakes. Of course... all this is speculation that the disappearance of the group can be too suspicious, and we have no energy to send another messenger group now.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this case, we should stand Sending troops to punish his arrogance," Tefron whispered. "Even if the messenger has nothing to do with him, these witches who travel to the West are worthy of our cleaning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Mayn did not respond, but pointed to the third letter, "You still read the last letter and said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefron doubts He gave him a look and spread out the letter paper. Soon, his hand trembled, and finally he couldn't hold the thin piece of paper. "There are a lot of witches in the fjord and all the churches destroyed? That letter is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From Hailong Bay, and the last church to be broken," Mayn closed his eyes and leaned against the chair. His tone suddenly filled with fatigue. "The fjord cannot be without warning." There is only one possibility for the emergence of a large group of witches. They migrated from the mainland." And the letter also mentions the extraordinary. In the church law, it is clearly stated that once the traces of the extraordinary witch activities are discovered, the gods must be given priority. Carry out arrests. But the fjord islands are too far away. Now that the wolf heart battlefield is in a state of anxiety, he has no time to take care of the affairs across the strait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you please ask the Pope?" Tefren asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Mayn shook his head slightly, pressing down the feeling of powerlessness in his heart. This may be the test of the gods on the church. Seeing the truth of the gods, he opened his eyes and restored peace again. "The holy city of Hermes is handed over to you and Heather."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to go to the fjord?" The old bishop blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will lead the one hundred members of the Remnant Church and the Purifiers in the left-behind church, thoroughly clean up the gray castle west, and then look for opportunities to deal with the fjord witches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Legal law--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean interrupted, "That is at the Big Four In the case of the supernatural beings in the kingdom, now they are far from the sea and have little effect on our plans. Don’t forget, we are finally going to gain more land and population and continue to expand the scale of the gods. The prince is more hampering us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Just as Tefron’s intention to refute, there was a rush of footsteps outside the hall, the two A slight glimpse, looked at the door in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
