Yann muttered to the mouth while groaning vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, like the photos I saw in the newspaper, it shouldn't be wrong." Roland nodded slightly. Before he came, he did his homework in advance and had a basic understanding of the Sanye Group. The person who made the stage is Guardian, the member of the board of directors of Sanye and the president of the construction department, ranking fifth in the whole family and also the "father" of Garcia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought he would see Wimbledon III, but it turned out that Jielu did not devour the unfortunate King of the Grey Fort. At the same time, he also confirmed that the residents in the soul building have been completely accepted by the dream world, forming a self-consistent memory and interpersonal relationship. As for whether there is Garcia first or Guardian first, is it based on the existence of Garcia to create the Sanye family, or to randomly fill the Jiaye family into the three-leaf family network in a random way, I am afraid that it is impossible to know. If he does not have all the memories of another world, it is estimated that everything here will be completely true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the dream world is evolving in a direction he doesn’t understand, at least the cornerstone of the world is still constructed from his memory prototype, so it’s everywhere Uncoordinated. This in turn gave Roland a little peace of mind - the elements that were forcibly stitched together reminded him all the time, that he was in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the name of Jia Xia before is Wimbledon, but here is Jia. Such small changes are everywhere. If Cobb in the movie stealing space needs a personal item as a totem to distinguish whether the world he is in is a dream, then he will not have such confusion and confusion. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gade’s speech is nothing more than a thank you for the presence and support of the martial arts, and at the end, the daughter of the severance is mentioned - just as Garcia guessed. In that way, his daughter's absence is full of regrets and regrets, and said that he is willing to talk to her at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another round of applause from the audience, and the camera in the hands of the reporter just flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Roland sneered. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, as long as the abandonment of the renovation plan of the package community, or give full compensation, Garcia does not want to make trouble with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the speech is the toasting session. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is waiting for this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, come back later." He gestured to the witch, then took a glass of champagne and walked toward Guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He, thank you for your appreciation tonight, after the green project You need your support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where, where have you been working together for so long?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Miss Han Han, don't know if Sanye is satisfied with the newly built final martial arts hall in Nancheng District?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not been there." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...haha, you can definitely stand on this year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Gardner After finishing the front row of guests, Roland stepped in front of him as he walked out of the noisy crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are..." The other party is obviously stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland, Garcia's subrogation attendees." He replied straightforwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out to be you...fortunately, thank you," Guardian’s look quickly returned to normal, turning and starting a drink from the waiter. Those who awaken the power of nature are born lucky, I really envy you this group of young and promising."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland and he did not drink after clinking Champagne, "I have something to talk to you, privately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guardian couldn't help but frowned. "Sorry, I have other guests who need to entertain..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Garcia let me come to you, don’t you I don't want to know how my daughter has been doing recently?" Roland slightly increased the volume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the corner of the eye, he has seen reporters notice the movement here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the other party will promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, the image of "care for the daughter" that was shaped before will not be able to hold back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Guardian chose to give in, "If the time is not too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Of course, it won't delay you for a long time." Roland smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is such a VIP private compartment in the banquet hall, so that after the retreat, only the Guardian and his secretary, and Roland and his party are left in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if you stayed with him?" Roland glanced at the old secretary. "What I want to say is related to your interests."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, he is a family member, and I have been with me for decades." Guardian said, "It’s you, you are sure to bring these three. Pretty...the little girl said something? It’s not an amusement park here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no apparent impatience after the disguise, the tone is not The politeness before the restoration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that Roland thought that considering that he has the power of nature, the other party will inevitably be prepared. Although the age of the person is large, it can be seen from the action and standing position, and in all likelihood, it is also an awakened person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I want to talk about it is related to these three people..." He shrugged. "Long story short, this is a deal - they are Black households, and I need you to help them register as a legal account and arrange a good high school."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guardian paused for a moment before he started, "You I want to talk to me, is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is an ordinary person, I am afraid that the first reaction is "You are fucking me", the second reaction It is to turn away from the face, and now it can still hold back the temper, it is also good in the merchants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Roland said without fear. "For the Sanye Group, this should not be difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said this is a deal, then what can you give me? Stand up against Garcia, or let her give up the confrontation with the group and give the package to the new project?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am her friend, how can I do this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually a memory fragment After the secret, the tower building became the object that Roland was determined to protect. Any construction team that wanted to dismantle the building would face the 300-year-old Tsinghua witch. For example, it is a breeze for them to remove the track of the excavator in the evening, or to make haunting on the construction site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh...friends," Guardian sneered twice. "Then we have nothing to talk about."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily." Roland took the hunting license from his pocket and shook it in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is--" The other person changed his face instantly and quickly turned to look at the old secretary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary stared at the license for half a moment, then slowly nodded, "is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"How do you have this kind of thing--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the secret of the association, you have no right to know," Roland interrupted Guardian’s words. After all, even he himself does not know how the association is going to declare, review, and issue documents. "Just understand the meaning of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guardian is gloomy Staring at him for a long time, I took out a cigar from my arms and seemed to want to smoke. After a long time, I finally took it back. "It seems that my daughter has met someone who is not good... But Mr. Roland, the martial arts association is A legal organization..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Business is so big, there will always be some unspeakable resistance. It's okay on the bright side, in the dark. Hands-on, it's not so easy to handle, I'm right?” He stretched his fingers, “One chance to solve the trouble, this is the price I gave. But not everyone can do it, the first goal must be The perpetrator; secondly, he does not belong to the people on the bright side; in the end, he does pose a threat to you. I have the method of verification on the above three points, so don’t be lucky. So the association will not care too much about it. Of course, it is natural to be ignorant of the above."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, it is a black-headed leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are usually a lot of subordinate gangs in the hands of such people. The normal response requires long-term evidence collection, arbitrage, arrest, and trial. During this period, the company may suffer amazingly. The loss of direct use of violence is much simpler. From the other's eyes, Roland knew that he must have encountered several similar things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guardian hesitated for a while, "Mr. Roland, if you are serious, then the value of the three accounts is not equal."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but chuckle, and Garcia’s words were really correct—“Reassured, my father is not an unreasonable person, in business, especially in trading, he values Only benefit." Now maybe I have to make up a point, he knows how to advance and retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think of it as a deposit for an agreement. The three people around me are only the first one, and the final total should be around three hundred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three hundred...black households?" Guardian is okay, "The police will definitely notice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Getting it right, I don't want you to finish it in the near future. One year, two years... or several years is not a problem. After all, this agreement is effective for a long time." Anyway, according to Celine, not everyone. Can sneak into the heart to read, like Elena, Felice, it is better to follow him to rob the demon to fill the home more promising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case... I might be able to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So cooperation is enjoyable." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the old secretary took the photo to the witch, it means that the transaction will be established - although it will not set any words, Roland knows that the other party does not It will easily violate the promises made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was preparing to leave the room with three people, Guard suddenly stopped him, "Wait...etc..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else?" Roland turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My daughter, Garcia... How was it late?" Guardian hesitated, still asked, "I have called many times." Give her, but she didn't pick up..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, she is very happy." Roland replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the closed door, Guardian finally lit the cigar. After a while, he whispered, "Is this person really just an ordinary person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have the same feeling," the taciturn secretary Nodded, "The attitude of being above is not disguised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary people often show timidity, courtesy, when facing him. Emotions such as high, pretending toughness, etc., are brought about by the gap between age, wealth and social status. The power of nature does not change one's heart, especially those who just awakened like Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Guardian did not see the slightest discomfort in the other side, nature, relaxation, and faint look down is almost alive, as if he I have faced such a scene innumerable times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how is this possible? To know that his age is almost the same as that of Garcia, it is only twenty years old! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time, Guardian discovered that he could not see a person at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
