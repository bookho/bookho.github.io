			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot air balloon slowly landed in the castle courtyard after half an hour in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the baskets are on the ground, the witches who are attracted by the hot air balloons have gathered around them - compared to the beginning of the night, only the members of the Witch Alliance are basically All of them have arrived, and the books that have just returned from the City Hall are even trotting all the way. After asking the situation, she looked worriedly at the sky, fearing that this huge sphere would fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince has just climbed out of the gondola, and the book and Wendy immediately went up to preach and advised the other party not to take risks. After the prince defended two sentences, he wisely used this novelty to open the subject. The nightingale felt a little funny, and when she was ready to meet, she suddenly felt a stiff heart and stopped at the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw the eyes of Anna, who was taken out of the basket by Roland’s Highness, full of smiles, and a blush on her cheeks. The linen-colored bangs were split into one side, and a small clip was hung on the head, sparkling with silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale remembered a silver ingot that he had grinded when he was instructing the blacksmith to operate the big-headed machines a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that a hand made by His Royal Highness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other witches are also clamoring for a hot air balloon. Soon, the airbags swell again, this time Anna and Nanawa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale stood outside the crowd and stared at the hot air balloon getting smaller and smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her mind is Anna’s tender smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ordinary face is always very calm and quiet, Anna will rarely show such an expression - the nightingale with the help of the wandering journey, once in the streets of the big city I have seen a lot of similar looks. She knows what it means. Obviously, His Royal Highness and Anna are not simply looking at the scenery. Despite the lightning and the wheat, they couldn't do that step, but once the thought came out, it would be difficult to suppress it. She suddenly felt that her heart was like an empty piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the decision has already been made, but when it comes to this moment, the nightingale is far from what it is supposed to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went to a corner, sat down against the wall, watching everyone look like a mess, and her head was blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot air balloon was lowered again, and after Nanawa climbed out of the basket, she grabbed the leaves of the first plane and immediately sat in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night was coming back, Roland was no longer in the courtyard - after being taught by the book, he returned to the castle to do his work. She should go to the office and stay with the prince, as she did in the past. But the nightingale stood up, but now she couldn’t take her steps. She really didn’t know what face she should use now to face Roland. Even after entering the fog, he couldn’t see himself, but the nightingale was still clear, and the happy appearance of the other would make her More uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hot air balloon going up and down, probably after everyone has sat through it, Wendy came over. "Why stay here, don't go try it." Try it? It’s great to look at the town from the sky.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is anything more difficult to face than Roland’s Highness, it’s Anna. The nightingale stood up in a panic. "No, I have to go back to the office." After she finished the fog, she walked out of the two steps, why should she use her ability in the courtyard? Looking back at Wendy, who was looking around and looking inexplicable, she bit her teeth and quickly left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having dinner, she returned to the bedroom and leaned back on the bed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, until the end, she did not show up in the office. When His Royal Highness tentatively shouted her name, she just doubled his hand behind his back and said that he was here. Even the other person who pulled out the mahogany table and made her mouth-watering salted fish dried fish did not make her compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter, what happened today?" Wendy walked into the bedroom and closed the door. "I saw everyone riding a hot air balloon. You are sitting alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
