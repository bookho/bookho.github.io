			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a demon! Run!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He just mutated, hit Call the phone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help, help me... my feet are twisted..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "He came over, be careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland walked out with the crowd The chain store found that the shop next door was in chaos, and the diners were rushing to escape from the scene, but they were huddled by limited evacuation channels. The nearby masses heard the news of the demon people and turned and ran. Some people retreated while not forgetting to take out the mobile phone to shoot the scene. Only a few volunteers insisted on staying in the same place, carrying back and forth those who accidentally fell or scared. People who can't move can leave the danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... Didn’t you say that the level of law and order in this era is very high?" Felice touched her full stomach and her face was full of happiness. It is out of place with the scenes of horror around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, this is just an accident, don't care." Roland couldn't help but feel the cheeks hot, saying that the good world dominates, and the result is that when you come out for a meal, you can meet It’s too much to give up the face of the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the "Devil" in the mouth of the attacker also caught his attention. I don't know if it is an illusion. There have been more and more similar reports recently seen in newspapers and news. It seems that people in the dream world are awakening to the natural forces, but most of them become uncontrollable monsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Associated with the "erosion from the outside world" that Garcia said two months ago, he frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the enemy?" Felice asked. "Do you need me to solve him? Or go back to the park to find Jieluo?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland glanced behind him and shook his head. "The park is safe now. Let’s kill this guy first." Remember the first time I met a coke-faced man, the other It is not a safe choice to show that it is intentionally tempted to slay martial arts to kill, and it is not a safe choice to combine it with Jieluo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is also very concerned about the wonderful fullness of the magical cyclone that dissipates when the devil is dissipated... as if the flowing warm current in the body is greatly satisfied With the body, it has become more powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy should be a new slayer, you can understand it as a mixed kind of evil beast, but the power of nature protects it from ordinary weapons. You have to use the same strength to restrain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of nature?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the world The magic, but there is no gender limit," Roland bent over to pick up a stone, running the body's scent, and crushing it into a beach powder, "like me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis glimpsed, "You...become an awakened person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or extraordinary type," he said Proud, but nodded on the surface, "unfortunately it is only effective in the dream world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No matter which world, you can't It’s a mortal,” the ancient witch sighed sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The back of the two chain stores is an indoor mall. There should be a walkway. Let's find a hidden place to do it. Be careful not to let others see it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland returned to the fast food restaurant with Felice and found the back door to the mall from the staff area. As he expected, the violent explosion scared most of it. Customers, there is only one place left in the entire field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not follow the aisle to the blue road shop that was attacked, but let Felice unfold the blade and release the magical atmosphere - if not If you remember the mistake, the demon can feel this power and be attracted by its taste. In this way, Jiao Jiaonan mistakenly recognized him as a martial artist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not too long, the back door of the Blu-ray Road store was torn apart with a loud noise, and a man roared out of the dusty staff room. I don’t want to say anything directly to Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
