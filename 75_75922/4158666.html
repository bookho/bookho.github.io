			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the official business at night, Roland returned to the bedroom and saw that Anna was finishing her clothes, and she was still wearing a large suitcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know "She patted the folded clothes in the closet, "Ready to travel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no winter city to stop, Roland half jokingly said, "Is the Industry Minister just saying goodbye, isn't it really good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, except for a few finished products like steam turbines, enhanced piston machines, etc. The factory is now basically able to produce, the most qualified rate is low. And the members of the wonderful clubs you brought back, the talents are not bad, let them take care of the department will not cause any big problems."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait..." Roland suddenly noticed something wrong. The clothes that Anna picked out were basically plain and durable, worn by ordinary parties or other formal occasions. There are no silk dresses or skirts. It doesn't look like a joke. "Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floating Island, with you." She showed a look of this question. "You are not going to wait for the outcome of the front line in the winter city? I can see that after talking with the three seats of Takira, you The decision has already been made. Not to mention that it is more convenient to go from the air to the bottomless land than to take the mainland spine. If you don’t come back, the reason is very good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This can't be done--" Roland subconsciously vetoed, "Don't say how to fight the devil's main force. No one knows what is in the bottomless world. And listening to Heikezod, it has been occupied by the Tianhai world. How risky this trip is, you are not unclear--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anna stretched out her hands, patted him on his face, forced the shaking head to force it, and then rubbed his cheek. "I certainly know. Because it is clear, it is so."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is not high, and even has a gentle feeling, but as long as you look at her eyes, you can't refuse it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the other party overlaps with the appearance of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna at that time was still childish, with nothing but her ability, but even so, her determination is extremely difficult to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland had to make a final attempt. "You are different now than the past. As a queen, you have to leave everything without a winter city to take this unnecessary." The danger is not a mature approach -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are truly mature, you will not agree to let you go to nothing without knowing anything." Anna pressed his hands and interrupted him. "What will you end up with, failure or disappearion? It is a possible ending. In other words, this attack is likely to be the last time you meet, you think I will still Stay in the city? Since it's all adventurous, don't add me a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Roland knows that his last attempt has also been disintegrated, after all, Come and think, he will not be willing to wait alone at this time. "If we can't come back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation must be too bad to be worse?" Anna let out her hand and smiled. "But Even so, I won't regret it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through those black and white distortions Lines, nightingales walked into the empty office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is dark, most people are slumbering, and only a flash of fire can still be seen in the yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled the curtains before opening the drawer and placing the glowing magic stone on the lamp holder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the room was illuminated by soft light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pieces of the teapot have long been cleared by the maid, and the carpet has been replaced as a whole. The previous accident did not leave any traces, as if it had never happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
