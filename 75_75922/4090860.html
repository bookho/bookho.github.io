Maybe it is Crossing the border, invading us!" Brian said loudly, "Your Majesty, please order! No matter how far the enemy is, the First Army will crush them for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Invasion?" Barov raised a brow. "If the morning army can enter the gray fortune, what do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Total adults, I am just saying -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The example of non-existence is not convincing," Barov interrupted. "And most What is important is that things that can be solved through diplomatic means, why do you want to do so? Do not forget to leave the primary goal of this year. Do you think that the eldest son of a glorious city aristocratic family is even heavier than his grandmother!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay... rest," Roland clap his hands. "First eat something, wait until you talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the clapping, the attendant at the door immediately pushed a small car into the living room, so the officials ate the snacks, went to the toilet, and the intense atmosphere suddenly eased. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene has appeared many times in the three-day long meeting. After receiving the information from the North Army Garrison and the lurker Hill Fox, Roland put Relevant officials have gathered in the castle to discuss the next countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is obvious that the bureaucrats under his command have faintly divided. The city hall headed by Barov tends to be conservative. They prefer to focus on the kingdom and even the west, and gradually expand the population and strength until the completion of the unification of the Grey Fort regime. It is a matter of time for revenge on the move of the morning sun, Anpein Moya, but not now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army of Brian’s representative, as well as the staff of the staff, tend to be radical, but the degree of closeness is completely inferior to that of the City Hall. The former is probably influenced by the "new ideas" such as the enemy's enemies, the first enemy's discovery, the first enemy's destruction, etc., insisting on taking action, giving a lesson to the morning king's royal family, and rescued the persecuted Otto. Losey; the latter was largely for the sake of reward and reward, and they stood on the same line as the First Army - after all, if there was no war, they did not have room to play. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, some of the staff members come from the Long Song Fortress, and the understanding of no aspects of Winter City is far less than that of the City Hall. With a hundred holes, the sound is even weaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, Brian’s speeches were easily taken back by Barov. Compared with the eloquence, the gap between the two is really too big. It is very good to be able to express their ideas in front of a group of ministers. After all, the musket battalion is not old enough. It used to be a part of the ordinary villagers in Bianbu Town. There is a lack of knowledge and experience. This can be seen from the report of the Snow Mountain Defence War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Roland does not speak. From the current situation, the radicals are basically hoisted by conservative forces. I have to say that in three years, Barov's growth was even better than he expected. Perhaps the boss has been fully tempered by the former finance minister, and what he lacks is just an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that surprised Roland was that during the three days of the meeting, Isis never made a comment, but kept silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is still a bar in the hall that can compete with Barov, there is only this Northland pearl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the two from pulling each other's hind legs, and increasing the loss of internal fighting, Roland officially set up a new department in the city hall called the Defense Department. Responsible for foreign military affairs, incidentally, the staff was also included, making it a subordinate organization. Outside the Ministry of Defense, within the main body of the Security Bureau, the violent machine framework of the Gray Fortress was basically determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the minister is still served by Roland - before that, Isis was only an assistant to Barov, staying in the city hall to study affairs, despite the performance Excellent, but now it is really added. I just became a minister when I first started. I don’t want to say that if I rise too fast, I won’t appreciate it. It’s easy to leave a new impression on the new people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
