			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a square that has gathered more than 2,000 people, but the momentum is not much worse than the large gatherings of tens of thousands of people in the next generation. Roland is secretly sighed, and the ability to echo is really too It's easy to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of selecting these people is mainly to set an example for the people - none of them are nobles, and the iron axe is the sand people in the south; Although Mo is an alchemist, he is not a prominent person. He also climbed up from the apprentices; and Nanawa is a witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are aliens, civilians, witches, and later generations, which are simply impeccable political correctness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland hopes that through such a ceremony, all the people will be instilled with his ideas--Bianyu Town only talks about merits and does not ask for a birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first person to receive the honor is the iron axe, Roland personally handed the gold medal with the gray castle tower emblem, gear and wheat ear ring In his hands, the first soldiers of the stage raised their hands and applauded, and many people whistled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should all know his name, the first munitions commander, the iron axe!" Roland turned to face everyone, "before the demon moon He is just an ordinary hunter in the town. The battle of Bianbu Town has so far failed, and the Iron Axe did not have a absence. In the previous month, he also led the First Army soldiers to the Wangdu to rescue the affliction. The beleaguered fleeing people in the east! The more than 6,000 people who are now living outside the city wall are brought back by him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The masses in the square Most of them were Aboriginal and First Army soldiers. The serfs and fugitives only accounted for hundreds of people. However, under the mobilization of the echoes, the atmosphere was completely cold. When Roland spoke a word, the scene immediately evoked the identity and voice of the fugitives, and the intensity was no worse than the applause of the first army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe is also very excited, probably never thought about it, as a Mojin, he can also get the favor of the prince. He first carried out the military ceremony set by Roland, then kneeled down on one knee and gave him a knight of the kingdom. If it wasn't for Roland to support him, I am afraid he would have to give up the five people of the sand people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get up, as a soldier, just use the marching ceremony." Roland laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you... Your Highness," his voice trembled a little, as if he was trying to suppress his emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince comfortably patted the shoulder of the iron axe, handed a hundred golden dragons to his hand, and then let Camo Spoel stand in front of the stage. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This one, you may still see it for the first time. He is from the Central Kingdom, the Alchemist of Chishuicheng Alchemy Workshop, Kemer. Mr. Hurst!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the words came out, the people took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit Alchemist? Isn't that a sage who will be respected and courteous in front of the king?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is it the same as the royal astrologer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the status of the alchemist is higher than the astrologer. After all, the latter’s prophecy says no. The meeting will not be realized, and the things the alchemist has made are at least real."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And he is also from the Chishuicheng Alchemy Workshop, listen It is said that only the Wangdu Alchemy Association can be compared!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the four kingdoms Alchemists and astrologers have a status. For the civilians, the alchemists who are known as the sages are more worthy of preaching than the great aristocrats and lords. Roland was very satisfied with the reaction of the people. He reached down and pressed down. Then he said: "Since Mr. Stern did not personally participate in the battles, the several improvements of the muskets, from the single to the company, were separated from his chemical laboratory. Without opening the relationship, this is also an important guarantee for the first army to win. Without these alchemists - chemical products, Bianbu Town can not really win peace and tranquility." The prince paused for a moment, "By the way, the chemical laboratory is currently recruiting Trainee Alchemists, accepting the acceptance of the primary education in the town and passing the assessment, can accept recruitment, the passer can not only get a good reward, but also the opportunity to become an outstanding alchemist like Mr. Stern! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
