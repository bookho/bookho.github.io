			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Grey Fort Royal Palace, Tiffco held the scepter and looked at the proud chief alchemist Rayleigh Chenis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The alchemy formula taken by the defector Boer, do you have a clue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, my dear, this is the latest snow powder developed by the Alchemy Association. Please let me show it for you." Rayleigh squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After getting the new king’s approval, he waved back and immediately got two disciples each holding a skin bag and came forward. He laid two sheets of white paper on the ground, poured the snow powder from the skin and shred it into two thin lines. One of them is grayish white, the other is much deeper, close to grayish black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please see, this light color is the snow powder originally used for celebration, and the dark one is the newly developed quick-burning snow. Powder.” Rayleigh took out the flint and lit the powder on the paper. I saw that the light-colored snow powder slowly burned and smoked, and the dark color burned out in the count, and also ignited. The white paper laid underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does this mean?" Tiefco frowned. "My dear sister got the gadget, but it’s not like burning a piece of paper." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, respectful majesty," Rayleigh smiled with a beard. "I don't know if you noticed the smoke that it emitted when it burned. The faster the snow powder burns, the more smoke is released in a short time, and this is why it is very powerful. I will prove it with another test."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was two fist-sized parchment bags, wrapped tightly outside, the disciples lit the slender ropes from the paper bag, and then placed the two copper bowls on the paper bag. Mars along the ropes gradually climbed into the copper bowl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your attention, this time the sound will be louder, please plug your ears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief The voice of the alchemist just fell, only heard a loud bang, a copper bowl turned over to the sky, and the other was directly thrown onto the roof, and when it landed, it bounced a few times on the granite slab, making it crisp. The impact of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn! Tefko clenched his scepter, almost unconsciously swallowing his mouth, how could this old thing not speak out soon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two disciples sent Zhenfei’s copper bowl to the new king. He pressed the anger of his heart and focused his attention on the bowl. The pillars of the Wangdu Alchemy Association, who want to study alchemy weapons, are still inseparable from his help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copper bowl looks like it has changed at this time, as if it had been hammered from the inside by the hammer, the bowl has swollen a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have repeatedly verified that the power of snow powder is not about burning, but because of these gases, this is the truth of Boer’s formula." Rayleigh Station In the middle of the hall, "If you increase the amount of snow powder and compress it into a ball, its power is enough to tear the armor and make the body torn apart. I believe that this new type of snow powder will inevitably replace the knife and bow, even if it is training. The well-known knight is also no match for a civilian who is covered in snow powder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence caused a wave of turbulence, and Fefeco saw the hall. Several knights were obviously gloomy, and the steel-hearted knight Weimas seemed to want to argue with each other. He quickly knocked on the floor with a scepter, "Quiet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone has bowed, he only looks to Rayleigh Chenis. "Is the recipe that the defector took exactly the same as what you developed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, squat," Rayleigh shook his head, revealing a trace of disdain in his words. Jinfang has standing items, but the stock is not too much. When he was grinding and arranging snow powder, he just happened to find this formula. Even if he wants to test further, it is not enough for him to use it several times. And my burning snow Powder, which is the optimal formula obtained under a large number of tests, is far more powerful than the product of coincidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So fine," Tiefco My heart was relieved. Although I know that there are many people in Jiacheng who have been arranged before Jiaxia, I did not expect the Alchemy Association to have her confidant. This defection was a confession plan, taking away the alchemist Boer and more than a dozen apprentices. Originally, it was not a big deal. The alchemists were very rare in other cities. In Wang Duo, there were also twenty in them. It’s irrelevant to leave, but this person found a very lethal snow powder before leaving. , has not yet contributed to the association's alchemy formula, so that the next day disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffco cleared his throat. "Good job, I will reward you with 25 golden dragons as a reward. In addition, I will open a snow powder workshop in Wangdu Inner City to mass produce this kind of quick-burning snow powder, and you You can't relax, you should study its usage further. If you can really beat the Cavaliers as you say, it's fine to reward you with titles and territories."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the chief alchemist left, Sir Weimas couldn’t help but stand up and say, "His Highness, this kind of thing looks scary, But it is impossible to use it to defeat the Cavaliers. You also saw that it needs ignition, and the killing range is only about half a step. Before the civilians approached me, I have dozens of ways to make it fall to the ground. Close to the side of the body, you can also kill the opponent in the gap of the ignition, and then calmly leave. Rayleigh's statement, but the people who have never been to the battlefield's delusions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"We also think so, Your Majesty." Other knights Fun began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I asked him to continue to explore better usage," Tiefco said. "For example, shorten the ignition time, or be able to throw and use." Of course, no matter what kind of weapon, I believe that the knight is better than the farmer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, he has a slight disapproval in his heart. Civilians do have no effect. They are weak and ignorant, and they are greedy and fearful of death. But with the control of pills, snow powder can become a powerful weapon. At least when attacking the city gate and the shield line, only a few madmen who are covered with snow powder are close to the target, which is enough to tear a hole in the strong defense line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the footsteps suddenly sounded outside the door, and a guard went into the palace hall anxiously, kneeling down on one knee, "Your Majesty, you The militia team sent to the West seems to have been hit hard. Now the defeated soldiers have returned to the kingdom. I heard that they also brought a letter of responsibility from Roland Wimbledon. Many people now know this."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Tiefco groaned. "Let them close their mouths and bring them all to the castle!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the castle courtyard, a group of ragged militiamen squatted on the ground like mud, "Your Majesty Kindness, please give us some pills, I really can't stand it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You waste, except for consuming the enemy, is nothing at all, living is a waste of food Still dare to ask me to ask for pills? Tiffco looked at the group coldly and asked: "How did you lose to your opponent? The battle process? Who can make it clear, I will reward the antidote."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly screamed. "We were attacked on the ship, and the fleet quickly became chaotic. The Cavaliers ordered the landings, but there were people on the shore. I don’t stop shooting, but it’s very intensive and I can’t fight back. The Cavaliers took the lead and surrendered. We’re following...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...I don't know, they took us back to the camp, but didn't see the Cavaliers."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fefco frowned and his voice was colder. "How did you come back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is Prince Roland Let us go," one said quickly. "He also gave us a letter to let everyone hand it over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You?"<br / >< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, I have it here too!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I also have a letter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people screamed and rushed out of Roland’s "letter." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell! Did he really send this to everyone? Tiffco indicated that the guards had taken the letter and found that all the papers had the same paragraph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your stupidity makes me feel sorry, Tiffco. Wimbledon. Repeated intrusions into the West is a serious mistake, you will pay for it. I will In the early second month of the fall, attack the king, and you will find that the position you are in is far less safe than you think. By then, all the kings will see that your throne is already faltering." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
