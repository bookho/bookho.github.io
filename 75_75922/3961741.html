			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Winter City, Changge District Pier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two cement boats are docked on the shore, the workers are moving the linen bags out of the boat, the newly appointed Ministry of Agriculture officials counted the number, the entire terminal It is filled with a hot atmosphere, which is rare for the influence of the evil moon, and the fortress where the road still has snow. After inspection and statistics, the seeds in these linen bags will be distributed to each farmer by hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, can the Golden No. 1 seed really increase the wheat production by more than three times?" Pei Luo still has some unbelievable, "Isn't that? The output of the field can make everyone fill their stomachs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Roland also heard Barov said, or said that in most nobles In the eyes, it is normal for civilians to be hungry. "It is the basic responsibility of the lord to let everyone eat. We have only taken the first step. In addition, you don't need to regard it as my kindness, you must know that you are hungry. The people in the stomach can't fully devote themselves to urban construction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... this is undoubtedly a great achievement, as far as I know, the kingdom No city can do this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The merits are indeed commendable, but I only make up a small part, the most important thing is to rely on witches – no The transformation of the leaves, the gold one is simply impossible to talk about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer silenced the small meeting "Maybe we were really wrong before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In treating witches In his opinion." He is long-spirited. "Most aristocrats disapprove of the propaganda of the church, but they also have disgust and caution against the witch. Cooperating with the church is nothing but a trend. Even if it is used, it is basically like a slave. Strictly guarded... Only if you see their value and treat them as ordinary people, this is the most incredible point - they are not ordinary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp You have not only seen the value of the witch, but also the power of the people. In fact, the potential of the latter is even more alarming. Witches are like catalysts. When they are added together, they can bring a leap of civilization. The more development, the greater the increase. However, Roland did not say the thoughts in his heart. "There is still a remedy now. After all, we belong to the same origin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, the boiler has been boiled, victory The number can be set at any time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let everyone get on the boat, I will come right away." After the prince commanded, he looked at Pei Luo. "The Ministry of Agriculture’s guidance team should be able to arrive in the afternoon. They I will tell you how to plant gold No. 1. As for the collection and construction of the mine, population expansion, education and factory opening, there have been enough talks at the meeting. It is good to implement according to the plan. Solve, don't tell me again." He patted the eldest son of the honeysuckle family. "After I left, I will hand it over to you, and I will do it well. The long song district executive will not be your destination."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not live up to your expectations, Your Highness." Pei Luo squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland boarded the cement ship and ordered the departure. As the whistle sounded, the victory slowly drifted off the shore and drove to the border area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is this the first bald ship?" Joe groaned. "They are all from the town!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The name is Bian District, the Lord is not talking about it, we are now a city with the town," Snake teeth grin, bald ship is the nickname of Joe to the weird ships without sails in the river, but he prefers the name of the stone ship - The large gray hull is like a meteorite, and even if the porter runs back and forth on it, it doesn't move. "What is it called?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No winter city." Tiger claws attached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take it, it doesn't matter to us," Joe said excitedly. "You will also take such a boat when you go to the town. Remember to take a look. Why are they moving without the sails and the white mist and black smoke from the top of the head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
