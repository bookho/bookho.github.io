			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden sunset fell a little bit into the forest, giving the surrounding clouds a golden outline. The sky is like stratification. It turns from blue to white, then turns from white to red, and finally turns into the afterglow to the earth, making the dense grassland red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the Gelan family territory there is a raised slope, standing on it to see the house, the farmland and the woods that connect the valley. When she was a child, she liked to ride on her father's shoulder and climb the low slope so that she could see the whole house. So when the wounded body of the parents was sent back and the servant asked her where she wanted to bury them, she did not hesitate to choose the slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, although she was sad, she still had some unwillingness to believe that her family had suddenly left. She only thought that if her parents could open their eyes again, No matter where they and their younger brother are at home, they can see it for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before returning to the tombstone of the parents, the nightingale has a completely different mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much dust on the stone tablet. Obviously there are still people cleaning it. She leaned over and stacked a stack of white paper in her arms before the two monuments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the trial book of the Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of irrefutable evidence, the Viscount’s heart defense soon fell apart, and after Roland promised not to sin the underage child, he not only admitted to selling himself. The facts of the dream water will also explain the cause and effect of the Glan family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original valley that separates the two family territories really hides the treasure, but it is not a gemstone vein, but a suspected gold mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who discovered it is the farmer of Somé. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the different terrains, the valley is the gully of the valley, but in the territory of Somalia, it is gradually level with the surface, and the farmers often go downstream to draw water, Take a shower. It was not until one day that a lucky child discovered a golden sand from the flowing springs and called for other people to rummage and rob, only to attract the attention of Dortmund. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately blocked the news and sent people along the valley to find the source of the gold sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his rewards made him disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The searcher did find more gold sand in the upper reaches. It seems that the erosion of the rain caused the wall to collapse and let the free crude gold fall into the water, but There is growing evidence that gold mines are likely to be located on the side of the Graham home, which has forced exploration operations to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the special status of Silver City, the knights and clusters allowed by the nearby nobles have been more or less restricted, and it is impossible to rob them. And the Viscount Soma is really reluctant to give up this huge treasure, and had to hit the abacus to the head of the Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His breakthrough is the old Gülen-Glan family’s distant relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan is simple but ruthless. He used the old Gülen to have neither the title nor the soft underbelly, to tempted the other party to cooperate with himself, and promised that he could change his master as long as he gave him a piece of land. The latter apparently failed to resist the temptation to become a true aristocrat and promised his conspiracy. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a purchase of a mouse by Dot, and the opportunity of the refugee riots killed the Glan couple, while the old Gülen took over the underage Hyde and the nightingale in time. Start to manage the territory. As long as Heide is an adult, it is a breeze to force him to give up all the land and the title. The heirs who have lost their asylum are not much different from the caged birds. Even if other nobles suspect, they will only think that Old Gülen is too greedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This step is a foregone conclusion, but the awakening of the nightingale has made the plan a flaw - she disappeared after killing the old Gülen on adulthood. It was hidden, and the latter did not wait until the moment he dreamed of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dott. Somé had no choice but to change the plan - he could win the old Gülen, but there was no way for everyone in the Glan to fall to him. After all, there is only one title that can be used as a chip. He must use it on the blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
