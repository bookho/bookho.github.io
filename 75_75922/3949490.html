			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Roland sent the lotus and honey in the back garden of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t want the two to leave so soon, but after hearing the pretty beauty waiting in the shoal, he decided not to delay it - at least it can show Out of your own generosity will not make Tilly feel embarrassed. It is a sincerity to send the important witches to Bianyan Town before the large-scale construction of the sleeping island requires large-scale construction. In this case, he is not too demanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid long-distance trekking in the snow, Anna and Wendy are sent to board the ship. If they are transported by the distance, they can be reached in half an hour. shoal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your care over the past few months," the two men squatted in front of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I should thank you for being right," Roland smiled. "You have made a lot of contributions to the construction of Bianbu Town. I have two gifts for you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rite, gift?" The lotus glimpsed, and a blush appeared on the cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honey touched his chest and aimed at the lotus, excitedly asked: "Can we have it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took two bags from the nightingale and handed them over to the other party. "Well, there are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honey can't wait Take it apart and pull out a long white cloth strip. "Hey, what is this, isn't it a corset?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, this is a scarf, He took the cloth made of pure cotton and wrapped it around her neck. "So, I don't have to worry about the cold wind and the snow falling into my neck. It's a little thicker. Cover your ears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔...It’s warm," the latter smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s an illusion, the face of the lotus becomes redder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still something inside," Honey played a scarf for a while, and pulled out a small box from the bag. "His Royal Highness, is this a gift?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, open it and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, it’s bright!" Lifting the iron box, said happily, "Look, you can clearly see what you are like!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a small embedded in a wooden box The mirror is also one of the commodities that are put into the convenience market. In Roland's life experience, as long as it is a woman, there is no way to resist this sparkling thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of honey attracted the attention of other witches, and the witches who soon fell asleep on the island gathered together and looked at the makeup mirror and couldn’t restrain themselves. The love and admiration of the love words on the table - after all, this crystal glass mirror coated by Soroya, the reflective and overall imaging are much better than the silver mirror, which also makes Roland see a new The way to buy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot air balloon was also inflated after the gift was delivered. The two boarded the gondola and waved goodbye to Roland and the witches. It can be seen that they are somewhat reluctant to leave the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to say that this is really a good place," Tilly walked over to him, whispering, "convenient water supply, comfortable room, hard to believe In just one year, you have transformed a poor place into what it is today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You regret it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean to send the witch to the town?" She laughed. "How come, if I can make them live better, how can I regret it. Don't forget, I It’s also a witch.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the white garden, Tilly’s smile is like a clean snow, beautiful without a trace of color. If there is such a sister in later generations, the rate of returning to take it out is absolutely 100%. But Roland knew clearly that her relationship with her was more like a collaborator than a younger sister, a natural ally. As she can see from her decision yesterday, in order to cope with possible threats, she even dared to go to dangerous places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
