			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast expanse of the sea has returned to the blue of the past, the beauty of the beautiful people riding the wind and waves, facing the waves, the hull with the waves, a rhythm sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sails are full! Young guys, move me!" One-eyed Jack shouted, "Today we can reach the shoal!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors on the mast shouted the number, pulling the three-finger hemp rope and unfolding the sails a little. In the sea with a changing climate, this kind of operation to sail and sail is several times a day. The people who looked up and climbed over the top of the head looked like a monkey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Itâ€™s really troublesome," the old captain walked over to the witches. "If I can also have the kind of boat that does not sail, it will save trouble." What is the name of the thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The paddle steamer," Lotus said, "It was made by His Royal Highness Roland."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you let your Highness create a ship for you?" said the seabird with honey on his shoulders. "Others can't say anything in front of him, you are different." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little devil, how do you say that I am familiar with him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You are familiar with Terry," she vomited and said, "His Royal Roland is good for Tilly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack sucked his mouth Looks like a heartache, "...still forgetting, listen to the group of businessmen saying that a paddle steamer needs more than a thousand gold dragons, even if I sell you, I can't get it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not necessarily," The wind is jokingly saying, "In the "Sleeping Curse", the bonus of the lotus is calculated by a hundred golden dragons. The last businessman named Durat Jinshou also plans to use a long-term package of more than a thousand gold dragons. Let her down. This is the case with a lotus flower, not to mention the four of us. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wave! "Lian hammered her fist angrily. "You know what he is paying attention to. I don't want to hear his name again!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just kidding," and the wind slammed her into her arms and whispered, "How can I be willing to sell you?" After listening to this incident, Master Tilly also negotiated with the Chord Moon Bay Chamber of Commerce, and no one would mention it in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your feelings are really good," Jack spit out the smoke circle. "But...the two seem to rarely talk to you?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two witches mentioned that the three had a short silence. After a moment, the wind and the wind began. "They were originally the wolf kingdom." Witch. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old captain said, "Not all witches?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They support Herti Morgan more than Tilly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Morgan..." He thought about his chin, "Is it the royal family of the wolf?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Branch only," and the wind waved, "In fact, nothing, everyone is only getting along for a short time, can not open their hearts." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is probably aware of something and has not continued to ask.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lian does not understand The kingdom of the nobles, she only knows that the witches on the island are not as sister-like as the town of Bianbu. Most of them come from the gray fort, and some from the morning and the wolf. Because Tilly is the organizer of the move, Plus the most noble status, everyone sees her as the leader, as does the exotic witches. But when the churches in the fjord islands are eradicated, the situation is getting different.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially noticeable for the return to the sleepy island of the evil moon. It has only been seen for only a few months. The wolf witch has gradually lived together and rarely talks with others when dining. Listening to Molly, they used to be members of the bloody meeting, similar to the Grey Fortress, and the leader of the bloody meeting is Herti Morgan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When you first joined the Sleeping Island, there were only more than 20 witches in the blood, and it was less on the island. The number of factions, if only this is the case, but there are more than 20 people, there are 18 fighting witches. Or, when they accept the members, they have been selected in advance, only strong and powerful witches can join, this A little different from the practice of helping the whole society and sleeping on the island. Because of this, their fighting ability is extremely strong. When Tilly implemented the cleaning plan, the Wolverine Witch had the largest number of believers in the Ssangyong Island Cathedral.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
