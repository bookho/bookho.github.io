			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably not wanting to be recognized, wearing a plaid shirt and a pair of jeans, wearing sunglasses and a cap on her head, looks very low-key. Only the memory of the four princes in the memory of the four princes was too deep, even if the face was tight, the sound could be immediately discerned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at the note on the arm of the chair and confirmed that he was not in the wrong position and asked, "Why can't it be me?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," she apparently saw the name on the note and had to make a dissatisfied nasal sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, you actually have children?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is incredible, is it Garcia? After I went to the clear water port, I not only gave birth to a child, but also swallowed it by Jie Luo in the battle of Yong Dong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cousin," she spit out two words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it seems to be a generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason, Roland felt a little strange in his heart. Garcia’s attitude towards him seemed to have changed from the first time he met, although the impatient feelings still lie in words. But without the initial contempt and disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the various personnel continue to arrive, the parent meeting will finally begin. After the teachers on the stage finish the new semester planning, they will turn to the student speech. When Jie Luo stood up, there was a stir in the parents' group, and the children also pointed their attention to her. I have to say that it is really cheating to keep the witch's appearance in the dream world. It is the natural white hair and the crystal red dragonfly. It is the beauty that has been raised to a unique level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the students were able to get up when they spoke, Roland had to enjoy a "eye-catching ceremony". Jieluo was naturally a child of other people, and he It’s a big adult... It’s something that can be felt from the doubts and sneers of other parents’ eyes – everyone else wears it as formal as possible, like a cartoon short-sleeved with half-length pants, and it’s really Some people are out of place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the seat, Roland felt that Garcia seemed to be stealing himself, which made him feel more depressed - the other person wearing sunglasses, stealing no worries If he blinks back and finds that the other party is actually not looking at it, it is quite embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results didn't take long, he felt the elbows being topped by the other side, and a piece of paper was handed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland frowned and spread the note, the handwriting on it was like a knife and a chisel, even if he didn’t understand calligraphy, he could feel the power contained in the brush stroke, but The content made his heart jump slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the mysterious martial artist who ran on the street a while ago, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hell, how did she know! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at Garcia involuntarily, only to find out what the other party was still writing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon the second note came to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not deny, the martial arts are very sensitive to the judgment of the figure and the details of the action. I was very familiar when I first saw the news. Now I finally confirmed it. Are you the natural force that awakened not long ago, or are you hiding your identity from the very beginning? Answer me honestly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memory figure? Is there such an exaggeration, even if the video that has been circulated is placed in front of him, he is not sure that he will recognize himself? But then again, Garcia should not be able to find a person with similar figures and ask him again. He can connect him with the mysterious martial artist. In a sense, it has proved that her observation power is indeed far superior to ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reason why her attitude has changed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland hesitated, just raised his hand, a pen has reached his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intended to deny it, arguing it as a ridiculous talk, but when the nib touched the paper, a thought suddenly poured into his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
