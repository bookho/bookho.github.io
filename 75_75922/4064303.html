			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland wiped the fine sweat on Anna’s forehead and held her in her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under dim light, you can still see a seductive blush on the girl's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last time she talked to her about dreams, Roland always felt that Anna became more proactive in this area and would try to learn some new skills - - Her progress in this area is much slower than the knowledge in books. Looking at Anna's clumsy and serious appearance, it is a completely new experience for him. The visual enjoyment even surpasses the sensory experience, and the superiority of an old driver comes to life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the storytelling time after the joy is always inevitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smell the scent of Anna, and Roland summed up the new news brought by the Takira witch and his own guess of the battle of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although we have long known that we are in a place where the mainland is a glimpse, we did not expect that the mountains were actually surrounded by civilizations that are very different from ours... It’s really full of unknowns,” Anna exclaimed. “Maybe one day, we can also set foot on the distant land to see what kind of secrets are hidden in the world across the sea.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There will be a day, I promise," Roland laughed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the sea can’t get through, you can fly over—the land that you can see with a telescope is not too far away. When there is an internal combustion engine, large airships will be used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, is there really a god in the world? Leaving the relics, prompting us to kill each other... maybe it is looking at us somewhere." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Afraid?" Roland couldn't help but tighten her arm and lift her closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I would like to thank it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" He gave a slight glimpse . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it sent you to me." Anna looked up and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland saw the blue lake light in the other's eyes - that was her undisguised feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that there is a surge of heat in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will stay with you all the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can't always stay By my side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just said half, he was Anna Covered his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the king, and the commander of the future against the devil army, how can you stay in the winter city? I can't occupy all of you because of my own desires." The soldiers who fight on the front line need to see you, and the people of other cities hope that you can be with them," she said softly. "Roland, can you tell me stories like this, I am already very Satisfied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was silent for a moment. "You are right, but no matter where I am, you can hear the story I said... I can guarantee this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna’s eyes stunned, as if he had heard what he said, “Don’t rely on listening?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," he nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the love between the two is also conveyed through listening, how to make people speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tomorrow you will know," Roland turned over to Anna Press it underneath, then kiss her neck... Then slide from the neck to the collarbone, leaving a shallow mark on the white skin. "But now, it's time for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
