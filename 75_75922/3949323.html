			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemo Stoll has hardly slept in these days. He found that Bianbu Town is the most correct choice he has ever made in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took two days and one night to turn "Primary Chemistry" all over again, and after sleeping for two or three hours, it was full of energy. Now that he has returned to the first page, he has carefully studied this ancient book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substance is made up of tiny particles! The change of matter is the decomposition and reorganization of particles! During the reaction, the total amount of the substance does not change! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, what the author of this book is, can actually portray the world that people cannot see so clearly. He has repeatedly suspected that the contents of the book are all made up, but according to the above example, the alchemy test, the results are fully in line! Moreover, some examples that are common in reality can also prove the correctness of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, "Oxygen" as described in Chapter 1. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gas is the main component of air, and people are not breathing air, but oxygen. Oxygen is required for flame combustion because combustion is essentially an oxidation reaction. The more oxygen, the more vigorous the combustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These words reminded him of the glass kiln in Chishui City, requiring two people to keep shaking the blast sac in order to raise the temperature inside the furnace to the melting point of the sand. Since it is a substance, it is obvious that it can also pass through alchemy... No, pure oxygen is extracted by chemical reaction. If you can directly pass oxygen to the furnace, can you save the blast equipment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the most amazing thing is that the book says that water is composed of two hydrogen particles and one oxygen particle, which is probably the water for all things. s reason. But hydrogen seems to be a gas. The two gases combine to become a liquid. How do you do this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo found that he still has a lot of questions to ponder. However, there is no doubt that he has walked in front of all the alchemists. When they are still exploring the formula in chaos and fog, there is a straight and flat road in front of their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the business is still going to be done. He reluctantly closed the book. At this time, the horizon has gradually become white, and it has reached the time of work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemo blew out the candle, approached the bedroom and looked at the sleeping wife and daughter, and quietly went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house assigned to him by His Highness is located west of the castle, much larger than his home in Chishui City, and the walls are made of masonry. It is easy to mold wood, and the house is obviously much more comfortable, and the furniture and kitchen utensils are all available. Although he did not say anything in his mouth, he felt more satisfied in his heart. The disciples lived in another neighborhood two blocks away from him. The house was smaller and not a separate house. It was a bit like a hotel setting, and one bedroom could accommodate four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the chemistry lab by the Chishui River, the disciples are already busy. They are carefully selected by Caimo, who have been studying cleaning materials in alchemists since childhood, and are now between the ages of 20 and 30. When he saw the cleaned laboratory and the sparkling glass container, Kemo nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, the chief instructor," the disciples bowed their heads together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Begin." He took a pair of gloves from the cupboard - the gloves were extremely thin and flexible, presumably stitched with animal intestines. of. Previously, there was no such rule in the alchemy workshop, but His Royal Highness repeatedly emphasized the dangers of chemical experiments. In the operating regulations, all the windows involved in the reaction of corrosive materials must wear gloves and open all windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the workshop, their work is now very clear, that is, to make acid for the Highness. The method of double stone sulphur has been operated many times, so Kaimo only needs to patrol the side and do not have to start the game in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two acids are well documented in Elementary Chemistry, one called sulfuric acid and the other called nitric acid. He used to be named after the manufacturer, such as the former called citrate, the latter called nitrate. The name is different, the preparation method is basically the same, the acid vapor is obtained by retorting the vermiculite and the saltpeter, and then the acid solution is collected by condensation. Green carp is usually associated with sulphur ore, and saltpeter is produced in a special septic tank in large cities, which are common raw materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
