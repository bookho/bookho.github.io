			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step down the crater of the crater, Teflon felt an inexplicable chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of this quiet and deep church, the secret of the church’s core, the Hermes institution, is hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first time to get involved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Mae Mae really let me come here to see him?" By convention, only the one who is considered to be the successor of the pope is qualified. Entering the pivotal agency, and he is old, it is impossible to take over the position of Mayn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have worked for the church for so many years, and have worked together together, and you have a strong trust in you," Isabella laughed. "And the rules of the past." Not suitable for the upcoming war, the gods should not be buried underneath, it needs to be revealed to all the lost believers, leading us to meet the final challenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... what does it mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." She softly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the organ, the two judges greeted them. "The bishop is a master, and your majesty is conducting the magic stone test. If you have a stone with a god, Please hand it over to me - it may affect the operation of the magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefren nodded and handed a string of god stone necklaces to other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty is here, please come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella Turn Into a long passage, pushed open the iron gate at the end, with the screaming screams, Tefron saw another faceted pure. She is like a ghost, and it is stuck behind the door. If the black gauze wrapped around the body can see the white skin, it seems that she has no size except for this tulle. The most striking thing is that the witch's eyes are different from the pupils of ordinary people. Her eyes are gray and gray, and there is a whirlpool in it. It looks like it has been sucked in for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teflon subconsciously bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time he noticed that the other party did not wear shoes, but the feet, the symmetrical needles were covered with a little red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop’s mind couldn’t help but think of the phrase “the witch’s taste is not comparable to that of an ordinary woman”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, are these witches a goblin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender feet quickly moved away from the position, and Isabella’s reminder came from the ear, "Adult?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," Teflon gathered his mind and walked into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was not big, the turpentine torch hanging on the wall was burning, but he did not smell the familiar sweet smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four pure people sit around a stone table, playing with a pile of crystal clear stones, and the stone table stands next to the current pope. Mayn’s majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefron is preparing to bow down and his arm has been supported by Mayn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are no outsiders here, don't worry about these vagrants." He smiled. "We are old acquaintances, Master Teflon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t seen it for two months. Mayn’s forehead has had a few more wrinkles, and a few silver wires have emerged from the hair, but the tone is still as familiar as ever. There is no shelf at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't do this..." Tefron suddenly felt a warmth in his heart. "Even if there are no other believers, the order of the church must be observed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what I said is order," the pope smiled in disapproval. "Don't talk about this... Is the situation above good? Originally I was going to let Isabella conveyed your message, since you are here, let me talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty." Tefren nodded . After telling the story of the church, he talked about Isabella’s last command. “Now the resources we are preparing for are all for the dawn kingdom. If you re-mobilize, I’m afraid it will take a lot of effort. Why did you suddenly decide to attack? Grey Fort?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
