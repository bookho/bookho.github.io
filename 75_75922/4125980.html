			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glow City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the noon bell, Horford Quin dropped the quill in his hand and couldn’t help but look southwest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news that Wimbledon’s four princes ascended the throne has spread not only to the Grey Fort, but also to a large number of propagators in the morning squad - according to the statement on the leaflet, if not In the event of an accident, this moment is the time when the young man is crowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoffford can't help but feel that he is a little older than his daughter, Andrea, but now it is the undisputed king of a country, its influence Force even crossed the border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the war with the Moya family, some people in the aristocratic class of the morning king may not know the real name of Wimbledon III, but few people do not know Roland. The name Wimbledon. At first it was only circulated in the underground chambers of commerce, and later the anecdote about the prince spread from various channels, like wildfire passing through the grasslands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And three years ago, he was only the lord of a remote town, the least optimistic of all the Wimbledon royals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of such a rapid rise is just like the Arabian Nights, and it’s no exaggeration to describe it with monsters. And his many acts are as unpredictable as monsters. It is like this ceremonial ceremony. Throughout the ages, the coronation ceremony was held in the winter of the evil moon. I am afraid that he is only one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the kings like this usually only appear in times of turmoil or chaos. Reminiscent of the inside story of the battle of God, he faintly felt that the world is likely to usher in a drastic change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty," the words of the guard interrupted his contemplation. "Silver Fox sent a letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Hofford regained his gaze, "Open and read me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"陛下" is indeed an easily intoxicating title. He has been the hand of the king for nearly two decades, and his screaming screaming is innumerable. I thought that there was resistance, but when he was called by others, he could still feel something in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a blessing to the king of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoffford is clear that he can sit in this position and let other idiots retreat, which is the support of the power behind the neighbors. Those big families are not afraid of the sword in the hands of Quinn, but they are full of fear of the thunder of destroying the earth. At the moment when this upheaval is coming, it is the most stable way to tie the family fate to the gray fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The letter said that a mine-seeking force at the Grey Fortress entered the dawn border and they hope to receive your assistance and support."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inform the Count of Losi to let him lead the Knights to meet," Horford quickly ordered. "You also took my mouth and told the way around." The lord must provide all the help needed to this team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, squat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf Lake, Dagong Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this place is far from the area affected by the evil moon, the cold and cold sea breeze that passes through the city still reveals a bleak feeling in the town, and there are few people on the muddy streets. Only the dock area barely maintained a little vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, an open-air wine shop set up next to the dock warehouse is particularly eye-catching - it is mainly for the sailors to provide extremely cheap warm-up hot wine, compared to The pub that can shelter from the wind and rain, the passengers are generally addicted to the mouth, and the chill of the stomach is dispelled by the way. Few people will stop and stop after drinking, but at the moment, there are nearly a hundred people gathered in front of the shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman wearing a coarse cloth was also attracted to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil." She replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What--"The latter's face changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard someone mention the devil," said the woman, who was called Farina, and repeated it. "Await another time, Joe."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man hesitated, and finally bowed his head and responded with a very low voice. "Yes... Your Majesty."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not an order," Farina waved her hand in disapproval, then approached the crowd a few steps, hoping to hear more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never seen such a terrible monster, they have wings longer than people, and their feet are thick and the walls are for them. It’s a fart!” The source of the sound seems to come from a sea merchant. The feeling of being surrounded by the center makes him extraordinarily proud, and the door is getting bigger and bigger. “But this is not the most terrible. The devil is still sitting. Another kind of devil, like a human, is much more powerful than a human being. The spear throws like a long eye, fast and awkward, and the armor can't stop it! Not afraid of your jokes, I almost didn't wet my pants. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sound of coolness in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real and false? Isn't that no one can rival?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only In the sky, you can't touch it at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small group of people expressed disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You blow it, but the devil - do you distinguish between the evil beast and the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, go to the Hermes Plateau, where there are monsters, I am afraid that you are so easy to pee, don't freeze the little brothers when you arrive."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you know a fart!" The sea merchant called out. "That is the name of Roland Wimbledon! He stayed in the West for a few years, can I don't know the difference between the evil beast and the devil? I want to say that the evil beast is a bunch of chaotic refugees, and the devil is a well-trained army! You have seen the batch of wild beasts in batches, focusing on attacking the city. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are telling the truth, can the gray castle be blocked?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You don't understand this. It was a crisis at the time, but the fire and thunder and lightning flashed on the wall. It was like a slap in the ice!" He slobbered. "The devil blinked in the sky." open, The flesh and blood splashes are everywhere, and one falls in front of the hotel where I am staying - the big hole in the chest, almost like a bowl, God knows how they did it!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bed cannot be so powerful. According to you, is the strength of the prince not the same as the god?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "H, or do you think he killed the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina suddenly squeezed his fist when he heard this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Joe held her shoulder and shook her head silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." She took a deep breath and let go of her hand. "What do you think of this?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Red Moon is not yet in the world, the devil should not be able to appear in the wild, but his description of the devil is similar to the record in the Holy Scriptures. It is not like a casual fabrication, so I also... ...is difficult to discern." Joeton paused and looked worried. "But these have been with us-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has nothing to do." Farina answered. "You are right, Joe. We have to solve our own problems first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the death of Acting Pope Tucker Talden, she followed each other The behest, with the remaining trial troops evacuated the new holy city, intends to rebuild the church on the Dagong Island of the wolf heart. It used to be the stronghold of the witch organization's bloody meeting. After being annihilated by the church army, in order to prevent the other side from returning, the holy city sent people to settle down. It is also a land that has been cultivated for a long time. It is ideal as a new place to stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
