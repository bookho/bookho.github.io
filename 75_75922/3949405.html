			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sits on an office chair and looks at the statistical statements made by Barov. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a full three days for the City Hall to sort out more than 6,000 refugees. The proportion of artisans was low, and only one was approved. One hundred and eighty-six people. Of course, this is also related to the strength of this review – because it involves the allocation of housing and the issuance of identity cards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Roland’s consideration, in the future, the resident who holds the identity card must be considered as his official contributor, so he has to be firmly in control, and the number is small in the early days. It is better to train the core advocates of the town when the control is in control. After the population grows, use the power of the people to assimilate other new entrants. After all, people are social animals, as long as the environment is so There will be more and more people agree with his ideas, and he can indeed bring better life to the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These houses of the craftsmen will be handed over to you, whether they are single or dragging their homes, at least one independent suite will be allocated." Roland ordered Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Barov said. "I would like to ask His Highness, are these houses issued as gifts?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the rental," he shook his head. "Indigenous people get a new home for free because most of them have old houses. They are old houses for new homes. If these people donate houses, it is not conducive to let them Going out of the house and actively participating in the work. Of course, the rental fee can be calculated according to the lower grades, and tell them that as long as they work hard enough to win the Golden Dragon, they can directly buy the house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of silence, Roland suddenly asked: "How many fugitives have appeared after the ceremony?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today, there are none of the aborigines, and there are seven serfs," Barovton paused. "The refugees in the East have chosen to leave more. A total of one hundred and fifteen people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," he sighed softly and decided to push the witch to the stage. The moment, he knew this would happen. In order to assess the public's reaction and avoid accidents, Roland also specially arranged a musket squad to stay in a few miles away from the town, intercepting the evacuees and counting the number of people to see how much they accept the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this answer is not perfect, at least it is very good - the aborigines have completely accepted the witch, which is close to his expectations; the serf The number of escapes is less than estimated. It seems that the drama performance close to the bottom life is better; it is the refugees in the east, they have been treated by witches, and they are in a situation where their homes are destroyed and there is no way to go. There are still hundreds of people. Choosing to leave, this made Roland feel a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Highness, I suggest that all of them be executed," Barov said calmly. "In this case, the determination to leave is necessarily subject to the church." People who have a deep influence. In the foreseeable future, they will not stand on the side of the kingship. Ten people will be converted into believers in the church. There is no need to have a trace of kindness to them."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not necessarily... The true people who are pious to the church should be more than 300 refugees who are not willing to leave the kingdom in the face of evil," the prince closed his eyes. "These may be just I can't change my mind, stubbornly think that witches are evil and want to escape from this place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even though, they are also potential enemies," Barov insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you meet this group on the battlefield, Roland will not hesitate to defeat it, but because of the backwardness of ideas and the inconsistency, it is necessary to wield the knife The death of a group of civilians is a huge psychological barrier for him. After hesitating for a moment, he finally refused the proposal. "I will let the nightingale go to interrogate the escapers. If there are spies or spies hidden inside, grab them and hang them, and others will expel the West."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barov’s eyes flashed and bowed his head, and he was slow to answer, “Follow, Your Highness.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anything else to report?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no time, Your Highness," he coughed twice. "I will deal with housing allocation." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
