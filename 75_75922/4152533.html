			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you are not soldiers, and that there is a group of people in the First Army Reserve and the Second Army who are driving training on steam trucks, but the time varies. People.” The iron axe’s calm eyes swept through the crowd. “Since you are the first driver to pass the assessment and achieve excellent results, it means that you are good enough, and you should be more than capable of carrying this task.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The task is very simple," he walked over to the map on the table and moved a piece from the dawn to a black line in the wolf heart. "There is a central part here." The checkpoint is about 150 kilometers. You only need to transport the people and supplies on the bus here, and then take them back after they complete the attack. The stay time is about half an hour. If you are lucky, you even Will not meet the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, the iron axe paused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a stir in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the other meaning of this sentence is that they will encounter the devil when they are not lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a while, the general commander went on to say, "Of course, the first task is still the first army. You only need to concentrate on driving. There are a total of ten vehicles, and according to the plan, four to five trucks can achieve the purpose of combat. Therefore, according to the practice of the Executive Office, recruiting personnel are used to select the starting personnel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Every time you complete a round-trip front-line delivery mission, the team will receive an additional bonus of three times the salary. This bonus is issued by the First Army and has nothing to do with the salary of the Executive Office. So... willing to recruit Please take a step forward now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina did not hesitate to take a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised her slightly was that all the teams chose to recruit, the only difference is the speed of making decisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is holding the front line to see the devil's purpose, and she has served in the trial army. It has become commonplace to step on the battlefield, but others Different - aside from the driver's identity, most of them are just free people without the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that they can make this decision with full confidence in the First Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Axe quickly picked out five cars in the order, and Farina’s second car group was among them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They will be handed over to you," the general commander looked at Fanner. "When the day is bright, the battle will begin!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always feel a little worried." After all the drivers left the headquarters hall, Ai Ge Shah whispered, "There are not many people dispatched, but they need to cooperate closely with the whole army, and there are ordinary urban people there. The practice time is less than one day. This arrangement is too urgent."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She now understands what the so-called "speed" of Beidi Pearl is. From the point of view of the plan, the program is indeed highly feasible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple hardening road that was previously repaired for migration is now the basis for counterattack. Even if its width, thickness and construction quality are not comparable to aortic engineering, it is still much better than gravel road or dirt road. In the case of further limiting the load, the vehicle can not run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at a distance of two hundred kilometers back and forth, the average speed of the Rubik's steam truck is much higher than any cavalry - the latter even if it is horsepower, double ride It also takes two days, and it takes six to eight hours for the truck to basically run the full course, not to mention the heavy equipment that the counter-attack team can carry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that it not only covers all of the First Army, but also introduces non-combatants. It is difficult to meet unexpected situations at that time. Speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This battle does have some unexpected factors, but it is almost insignificant compared to the income." Itis said calmly, "The devil may be re-arranged at any time." Fortress-type beasts, rather than waiting for the opportunity, it is better to grasp the present."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
