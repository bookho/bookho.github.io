			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the day was just dawn, Roland was pulled out of the bed by the nightingale - remember that the last time this happened, Nana Wa was given When I found the identity of the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? Did you find a new witch in the town?" he asked with a wink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Your Highness!" The nightingale screamed with excitement. "Anna... Anna's ability has changed again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And?" Roland has not fully recovered from her sleep. "Is she already adult?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s a change after adulthood. I have never seen such an amazing magical form. It’s just like an entity.” The nightingale came to the washbasin. “The book and Wendy have never heard of such a thing. Go ahead. Look, everyone is waiting for you at the office!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland casually washed his face, put on his clothes and followed the nightingale to the second floor, into the office, eleven The witch suddenly focused on him. Among them, Anna’s eyes were a little swollen, like a night without sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can tell me what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to open is the nightingale "When I walked through Anna's room in the morning, I saw that she was sleeping at the table. There was a pile of shovel on the table. I was ready to wake her up. When I came closer, I realized that the magic in her body became ......" She paused for a moment and seemed to be thinking about how to describe it. "It became a fixed shape, like a constantly rotating square."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Box?" Roland walked over to Anna and looked at her carefully - the other side was not tired except for the spirit, and there was no difference elsewhere. Then he noticed a cylinder placed on the table. The material seemed to be pig iron. The smooth surface of grayish white and the flat cut at the top made him think that he was blind. "This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Anna made it out," said the nightingale. "Use her new abilities. After the witch wakes up, the body will gather magic, which is as thin as fog at first, and will slowly become a group after a few years. The vortex of different colors, such as Wendy's white, the leaves are green... And Anna's previous magic is very large, a lot of adulthood, dark green, but now, the magic of her body Only the size of the fist is solid and completely opaque." She picked up the quill on the desk and roughly depicted it. "It's almost like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although the painting technique of the nightingale was very bad, Roland still recognized that it was a cube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked to Anna, "What happened last night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna’s own experience Tell it again. When she finished, the other witches were still in awe-inspiring appearance, completely ignorant of the relationship between the small ball, vibration, connection and ability changes in her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Roland’s heart moved slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic is an energy in his vision, and the witch is the terminal to release it. The magic can be transformed into endless effects, but which effect will ultimately be formed, depending on the witch who controls it, or, further, depends on the witch's thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If his guess is correct, thought can have a profound impact on ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, a person who has never seen a plane can hardly think of a huge iron bird flying in the air; a person who has never seen the universe, Naturally, I don’t know how wide the world is. The height of thought and the breadth of knowledge limit the use of magic. Every further understanding of the nature of the world will bring about great advances in science and technology, so will the power of the witch be the same, and the depth of the world will be deeper. Also closer to the source? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me see your new abilities." Roland is curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna stretched out her fingers, and a black flame appeared out of her fingertips out of thin air. It looked like a normal flame, except that it didn't shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can your black fire change shape at will?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
