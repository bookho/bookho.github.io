			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Nightingale said, the reason why Camilla appears so exhausted and weak is mainly due to mental worries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just two days, she returned to her usual appearance, as if the helplessness and confusion of that moment never existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also made Roland relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of a long-range ambush battle, Camilla’s ability is crucial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the other person’s eyes were a little more watched and alienated than when he first came back, it made him feel a lot more natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the butler is still worried about Joan, but only temporarily put the uneasiness into the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she also shoulders more important responsibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of Joan’s disappearance was not disclosed to other witches, especially lightning, except for Roland, Tilly, Anna, and Nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is familiar with the winter-free expedition formed by the little girl, and knows that Joan is one of them. Today, lightning and wheat stubs almost constitute the outermost warning line of the First Army. They have not left the battlefield once in a few months, and the pressure can be imagined. Plus the lightning itself is hurt by the demon, and there is no mistake, so this kind of news of increasing troubles is better to keep it secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following week, he repeatedly ran between the third side of the city, the weapons test site and the castle meeting room to determine the final ambush plan. Because the target is a threatening demon, the flexibility and speed of flight far exceed the fear of the beast, so that the difficulty of implementation has increased a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that the plan that can be finalized in two or three days encountered a lot of trouble in the simulation process. Fortunately, this is a project that concentrates on the strength of the united front. With the cooperation of many parties, a feasible plan has finally been drawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision-making meeting was held directly in the underground hall of the third side of the city in a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to speak is Ellen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She manipulates the magic core, and phantom projection in front of everyone, a few meters long light curtain is like a window hanging in the air, the opposite is revealed The scene behind the ruins of Takula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the illusion is not a real window, it is impossible to look into it, so the field of view is a bit narrow; the angle cannot be adjusted after the multicolored stone is broken, resulting in It is difficult to observe the situation around the ruins. However, it is just facing the devil's only supply line, but it provides an intuitive and convenient reference for the development of ambush routes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This blood line is northeast-southwest, and almost every day there will be a team that provides red fog to the devils stationed in the ruins, and ten months ago That is, when Luo Jia first discovered the devil and the ashes, the number was three. From this, it can be concluded that the number of troops lost by the enemy and the number of existing troops since the implementation of the torch operation. Because there is only one supply line, the high order If the devil intends to retreat, it will certainly not deviate too far from this line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blood line can't be disguised?" Wendy still has some concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as the devil still needs red fog to maintain vitality, this judgment is the most reliable intelligence." Although I have answered many similar questions before, El He also patiently explained, "They really have used tactics to transport a lot of red fog to cover the main offensive direction, or carry a lot of red fog to carry out long-range attacks, but have not seen the need to compress red fog to cover up large units. The situation of the situation - because that is equal to suicide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, very understandable," Ai Gesha added, "If the devil really has no red fog Means, it is possible to bypass the frontline site and directly attack the interior of the Grey Fort - whether it is from the secluded forest or the Hermes Plateau, the threat to us is much greater. The tip of the sacred veins The monument is no longer the stronghold they must defend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See you no longer have objections, Elk goes on to say, "The supply team is basically modified. Siege beast and a few mad magic guards, special No action group and the seagulls do not pose any threat, so the main defensive volley, or the sky flying Horror "<br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
