			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," when the only Margaret and the Nightingale were left, the Thunder took up the disguised smile and said to Roland honestly, "See The way she looks now, I feel that the original choice is correct - I will ask you later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She grew up..." Greg also sighed, "A serious kiss of a big population just now makes people want to embrace their arms and love them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, you are putting The voice came out, Roland thought. "But she didn't give up the adventure. Even here, Lightning formed her own expedition team - although the members are currently only three. Unless she is locked up, she will one day catch up with you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it’s unavoidable, that’s her fate,” Thunder smiled. “But at least not now. Before that day, I hope she can Peace and safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the battle of divineness is close to everyone, even if it is far from the sea, it is not necessarily safe. This is especially true of the no-winter city as a bridgehead. Once this place falls, the survival of mankind will become a bubble. It was only Roland who did not say these words. It was revealed that the gods were the most magnificent adventure in terms of lightning. She would never end halfway. Since it is impossible for her to quit, it is only a matter of increasing the other’s concerns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not worry, I will take care of her," he finally patted the thunder's shoulder and said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did he say?" Luo Jia will hold the wheat in his arms Put back on the top of the lightning. "Have your father been in the trap?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl shook her head. "As I expected, there was no news. But Don't worry, this kind of thing still has to be done by yourself to be more interesting - rely on the power of our expedition!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agree!" Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, is the mystery month coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not seen."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Lightning grinned. "Before I knew that I had a well-thought-out look. Why didn't I even show up now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's the story...what do she want to challenge us?" Luo Jia was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啥?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is a challenge, no matter what the content is, the expedition will come," said the lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, hey!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha..." The mad flame princess was unable to support her forehead. What kind of organization did she join? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am late--" Just then, the voice of the mystery came behind the three. Luo Jia looked back, only to see the mystery month pulling Lily's hand all the way to run, followed by Axia and Xue Lun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you didn't dare to come to Haikou," Lightning hugged his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come," riddled. "It’s just a matter of investigating things, it’s also to challenge the necessary measures to go smoothly."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," she shrugged indifferently. "Then you can say the content now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, but before that, I want to introduce my team first." Mystery opened his arms and pushed the other three into the front of the lightning. "From today, the Winter Detective Corps was formally established. This is my new Recruited members!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诶?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I am not!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear this sentence The words of the witches are different. Luo Jia, Mai Hao and others are confused. Axia and Xue Lun are inexplicable, and Lily is screaming angrily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, what you said!" Mystery explained quickly, "Wenty told me that the last time we went to the college to find the mystery of the arson Everything was known to him, and he mentioned the name, probably from the meaning of investigating the unknown and exploring the truth. Not only that, but he also gave me a special title."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Lightning expressed doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not believe you can ask Wendy sister, it seems to be called the roller...the drum washing machine is coming," the mystery touched the back of the head, "but she does not Know what it means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exploring the truth of the crime..." Xuelun indulged for a moment, "If you can help with the security of the winter city, Then I am willing to join."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can do it too..." Axia pointed at herself, "Miss Night Sister said, I am already a member of the Security Bureau. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem," the mystery month is a thumbs up. "Is lightning not always responsible for the investigation of the First Army? As long as we give priority "Complete the order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, please don't include me." Lily rolled her eyes. "There are many samples in the lab." I am going to record, the mushroom plantation has to be doubled again, there is really no time to accompany you to noisy - this time you call me a traitor is useless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;"Treason!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, I Wrong, you listen to me first," Mystery asked, "This time is definitely not noisy - you should all know that your Majesty has met a group of guests from the fjord, right?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"nonsense," Lily is impatient. "Who do you think this welcome dinner is for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But there is a witch among them, this is the point I want to talk about." She went on to say, "At the time I was in the port to check the lighting fixtures..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It’s just a random wandering, right, they won’t turn on the lights during the day.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, then I noticed each other "Mystery month forcibly ignored the other party's demolition. "I heard that these fjords have to stay in the winter city for several months. I think this will naturally include the witch, so the content of this comparison project is She is."<b r /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Lightning came to the interest, "What?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before anyone can pull her to join the team!" "Mystery month solemnly said, "There are now four detectives, the first big group of the Witch Alliance, but considering that you are set up earlier, it is counted as no matter what the above - and the winner of this test will decide Which side is the strongest team! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Luo Jia almost didn't bite her tongue, so the way to challenge is faster than who wins a strange witch? Even if it doesn't have to be sacred The duel is so serious that it can't be taken to this point!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised her is that both lightning and wheat are showing a serious look, especially the latter. The high-pitched tail means that the other party has entered the "combat preparation" state.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it still too late to quit... The three princesses want to cry without tears. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I don't agree with how many people can measure the strength of a team, we have to take this challenge!" "Lightning patted the chest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not think this is an easy task," the mystery moon swayed with a finger. "First, the witch named Joan." I can hardly speak, and it is difficult to communicate with people. Secondly, she has great wariness and fear for strangers. It is similar to us when we are chased by the church, so this trial is a long process. As for the criteria for judging, it depends on which side she is more willing to act with, how? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
