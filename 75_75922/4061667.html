			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the light wave passed through the body, Pasha felt a strange sense of traction, and the magic left in the body was instigated, as if to go with it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion of forced stripping lasted for a short period of time, and soon returned to calm, quiet with the magic, and the entire hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the short beard behind, she can see the area of ​​the ripples sweeping, the mixed kind of evil beast is like what is fixed, the whole body is stiff, then I fell to the ground without a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most efficient killing. No matter whether it is dirt, rock or brick wall, it can’t stop the promotion of “Tiantuan”, even if there is no monitoring of the ground now. She can also imagine the scenes in the upper layers of the maze—the dense mixed species of evil beasts will die like worms, and the magic that sustains their lives will dissipate invisible, and once there is no magic support, the alienated body will lose its ability to act instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are some common evil beasts with less variation and almost no magic in the body, but these kinds of animals without IQ can no longer threaten To the safety of the relics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Celine finally caught up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passa breathed out of the tentacles and looked at Elsie. "You go to see the situation on the surface." Then she moved to Elena. Around, "How is the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter are covered with blue and black blood, half of the arm is missing, and the hair is soaked with sweat. Just like fishing out of the river. "Fortunately, there is a lot of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence made Pasha breathe a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching around, the witch who is still able to move is still holding a shield, while the companion of the force is lying on the ground, trying to restore strength as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after just going through a big battle, their looks did not show the slightest exhaustion and despair, but easily opened their mouths and waved to her Come. Obviously, everyone thinks like every, and treats every battle as the last one in life. Even if they donate all for Takira, they will not regret it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Pasha feel a bit sore in the eyes that are no longer there - the heat is flowing slowly in her heart, like a hot spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every witch is equally important - in the long years of four hundred years, their number has never increased, and they have accumulated deep feelings One is a lot of news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just that the body has to be replaced," Elena said with a sigh. "I have chosen it for a long time before I choose it. I don't know the new one." Are there more handsome and strong in the body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Pasha was crying and laughing, don't talk about such awkward scenery at this time! She stretched out the tentacles and knocked on the other's head. "Who else needs to be replaced?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five, six," Elena groaned Fingers, "Betty was cut through the stomach, Izo was sprayed by the magma to cover Ayl, only one head left to see people, the rest are like me, lacking arms and legs, have been pulled Save the soul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you plan to pick out the preferred shell and transfer it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Of course, I feel no more, at least I have to look a little more comfortable," Elena pouted, and the bloody giant sword was behind her income, and she staggered and walked out without two steps. At the ground. "Hey, this damn body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of warrior does not feel pain, but also does not experience fatigue, but the loss of physical strength is real, Even if the spirit is still abundant, the exhausted body will become weak and uncontrollable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will take you there," Pasha rolled up Elena with the tentacles and walked to the side room of the main hall - but wherever she came from Hermes The Lordless Prisoners were collected for the survivors to use. "In the new batch, I remember that there are several good looks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
