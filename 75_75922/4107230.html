			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I used to be like you," after a moment of silence, Pasha suddenly said, "Every time I have a partner, I will stay in the city." In front of the door, the federation also built a tower there to rest for everyone, and if the team came back, they would know immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean Tacharia?" Tilly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but a few years later, in addition to the defending army, few people went there. Do you know why?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." She didn't answer, but she already guessed the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the last thing I get is always disappointment and sorrow." Pasha put her tentacles on her shoulders. "The identity between the witches transcends the blood, is the magic." Connecting us together, whether it is an ordinary fighting witch or a member of the Saints, as long as they get along for a while, most of them will become like brothers and sisters. But this relationship also makes the tower full of negative emotions, especially if it is difficult to wait until the return day. However, I only saw a dead body that was shipped back. When the peripheral defense line was compressed step by step and no one needed to go out, the Federation ordered the removal of the tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to say that waiting is unnecessary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the contrary, what I want to say is not to wait for a conflict, this Prove that you haven't really experienced the feeling of losing." Pasha's tone is slow and soft. "I hope that you will never become a day like me - indifferent to regard sacrifice as a common thing."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not lost it, Tube is to leave the palace or the island went to sleep, I have made many decisions, many of them related to gains and losses, and even give up a part of the same ...... as long as can go in the right direction, I do not have too much hesitation. But some people are different. There are always one or two special people, which will make me upset. Tilly grabbed the electric light magic stone ring in the handshake - if it was her, it was easy to alternately control the two magic stones, but replaced it with ashes, and even the flight could only go straight down, so the ring stayed in In her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she did not say these ideas, just nodded slightly, "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You're welcome, I'll check out the excavation progress of the desperate defense line. There is a lounge at the entrance to the main hall. If you want to sleep, you can go there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Passa left the way, Tilly suddenly felt a cold in her palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spread her hand and saw that the corner of the ring fixed the magic stone did not know when to peel it off, pierced her skin, left a drop on it Small blood beads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fifth day of today, why haven’t you seen the shadow of the ruins? "Leng muttered, "I am getting moldy every day, every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, anyway, where do you make holes, I will Where to go," a girl with a braided head shrugged, throwing a piece of dried meat into the air, then opened her mouth - only when the dried meat flashed a blue light and disappeared instantly, her cockroach Helped the drums up, "Well...the life without the winter city is really well-deserved, even the dry food can be made so delicious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Playing, punching "Do you treat me as a mole!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ......You still have to eat better," Iphie sighed. "I don't want to go hungry when I go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I don't want to Listening to the teachings of the witches of the bloody teeth, "the other party turned his head, I heard that you have played the idea of ​​Your Highness, and if I am, don’t say that the meat is dry, even the wheat cake is not for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yifeton I rolled my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough," Ashes reluctantly said, "It’s not their fault to join the blood. If you let Tilly hear it, definitely I have to teach you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
