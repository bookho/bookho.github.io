			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can come out," Aegusa looked at the corner of the cubicle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her voice, there was a faint shadow on the wall, and then the night owl appeared out of thin air, blocking the dim candlelight in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did you find me?" Her tone was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the ring was taken from the 76th," Aegusa shrugged and raised the jug. "Would you like a cup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you pay the bill." The nightingale sat down opposite the ice witch. "Can the magic stone observe the magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not magic, but an orange beam of light, or..."the key." "The latter took out an empty cup and filled it with it, pushing it to the other side. "Your beam of light simply illuminates half of the room, making it hard to think about it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She also noticed? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In all likelihood," Ai Gesha nodded. "She doesn't mind showing her identity in front of her." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not the same as her, just like me and the pure ones," said the nightingale. "Why, do you believe what she said?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you didn't take her ring." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I want to really help her, let her go on the right path." "Ai Gesha poured a glass of ale on herself, and then drank it all--the quality of the wine was rather inferior, far less than the fruity white wine made by Evelyn, not to mention the strange and chaotic drink. But nevertheless, The bitterness of sourness can't hold the pleasure of her heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha feels very happy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At the moment when the identity was revealed on the 76th, a sense of loneliness disappeared from her heart. It turned out that she was not the last survivor of Takira, and the same federation witch as her. It has spanned more than four hundred years and has continued into this era.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most of the Witch Alliance is very friendly, Wendy cares about her, But Ai Gesha always has a lingering confusion - she knows that this is a gully that has accumulated over hundreds of years, and it can't be filled in with a short period of time. In the face of the new era of witches, this kind of loneliness is fundamental. No one can tell that it is a ridiculous act to indulge in work all day.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exception to this is Roland Wimbledon, and only when she is alone with this strange mortal, will she give birth to a sympathetic consolation. At first she felt that it was difficult to understand, and later discovered that there was also one in Roland. The kind of barrier that can't be said is as if he is incompatible with the world - but the other side has to cover up better, almost no one can detect it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, she is no longer alone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, Ai Gesha hopes that the other party can represent the Takira witch to Roland. Don't make a request for a visit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two stand together to share the battle of the gods, is the scene she wants to see.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has already loved the life without winter city, and naturally hope that those compatriots can also like it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, There is still a small thought hidden in the heart of Ai Gesha.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants those witches We saw that her previous point of view was wise and correct - the cooperation between mortals and witches is the best way to fight against the devil.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what you deliberately Why is it cold? "Night eyes are complicated, like seeing her real thoughts for the first time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will understand on the 76th, wait for her to stay here for a while. after that. "Ai Gesha raised his mouth. "Isn't that just coming over?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the night was silent for a long time, until the swinging candlelight bottomed out, she gradually disappeared and returned to the darkness. "I hope she will make the right choice."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She will," Aegusa smiled. "I believe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;********** *********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 76th, I returned to the diplomatic building along the original road, and happened to meet Anne and his party who visited the beverage factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’m much better after I woke up," she said. "They just thought that there was some stuffiness in the room, they went to the yard." Circle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should wear more clothes, be careful to catch cold," Broken Sword cares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy pulled her hand and said cheerfully, "It’s a pity that you didn’t go with us this afternoon! Chaos drink made by Miss Evelyn It’s the most incredible thing in the world!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Chaos...beverage?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, she could only change the taste of the wine. After the evolution of her ability, she could create a delicious drink that never repeated. I swear that even the aristocrats of the Wolf Heart City would not have tasted such amazing things." Amy is very excited. "Whether it is black tea, honey milk or fine wine, it is not worth mentioning in front of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-level witch ... The 76th has been numb, although it is not clear what Wendy and Nanava said specifically, but there is no doubt that the Alliance has come to the front of the Federation in the cultivation of witches. According to Ai Gesha, the roots of all this seem to be rooted in the mortal Roland Wimbledon, which is what makes her difficult to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where mortals are better at knowing the magic than the witch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can testify," the hero echoed. "For a moment, I even felt that all the hardships I had encountered before were worth it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can occasionally take a sip in the future, I don't want to leave without the winter city," Amy vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we just joined the Witch Alliance," said the Broken Sword. "As long as you stay here, there is always a chance to drink it again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree!" Amy immediately raised her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...also," the hero nodded seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three looked at Annie together, the latter helplessly, "I listen to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Wait... Did you agree to stay here for an inexplicable drink? On the seventy-sixth, I couldn’t help but swear, and Anne, have you said that you should be cautiously observed and treated with caution? Well, read the tour of tomorrow and make a choice. If Wendy hears the reasons that prompted them to make up their minds, I am afraid that they will laugh and cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, she suddenly felt a feeling of envy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple requirements, easy decisions, as long as you see a glimmer of hope, you can move forward without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what about herself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone fell asleep, the 76th quietly left again. The room climbed up the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When facing the whistling snow, she lifted the ring in the direction of the castle and stared at it - a beam of light like the wall once again appeared in front of her eyes Even if there is no magic activation, even if it far exceeds the theoretical detection range, it still miraculously falls into her vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She needs to find a winner for the Takira witch, which is the biggest goal of the trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, to take a step back, the meaning of the winners for survivors, and the meaning of chaotic drinks for Amy and others, seems to be no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
