			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the frontline situation, the iron axe has been played with Itis hundreds of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion is that before the personnel equipment is not ready, the first army is difficult to take the initiative, only the defense is the main; even if the army is all present, You must fight flexibly and try to find the enemy's main force in order to get a chance to annihilate. Once dragged into the red fog area, the situation will become extremely unfavorable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the information of Tacchi, the red fog of the obelisk will eventually spread to most of the wolves," the iron axe pointed to the red on the map. Arc, "So our defense will be longer than ever. Considering the warning and preparation time, there are four cities near the arc that are suitable as the current defensive strongholds. They are Jinshiling and Feng from east to west respectively. Xiaobao, Xishacheng and Shenchiwan.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four cities have become a fold line across the wolf heart, echoing the future red fog area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now the First Army does not have enough troops to guard the four places, so it can only focus on defense. The most important of these is undoubtedly Shenchi Bay and fine sand city - they are each other's corners, and they are located at the top of the red fog area, less than fifty kilometers from the enemy's front. If they fall, the devil will have a chance to directly threaten the cage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Especially Shenchiwan." Xiaoxiao Chenguang added, "It is the nearest port to the cage mountain in the wolf heart. Now there is no winter city with 30% of the materials needed to transport through it. Lost Shen Chiwan means that the assembly speed will be greatly delayed, and this result will be unimaginable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Needless to say, euphemism," Isis is very generous "If the devil is attacking the sinking pool now, then we have lost half of the battle of the gods. Fortunately, the enemy may have encountered problems in the hands of the people - after all, the obelisk is built on the mainland spine, wanting Keeping transportation smooth is not an easy task."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably only North Pearls dared to say "defeated" in such a meeting, and the iron axe coughed twice. "In short, let us assume that the devil also encountered the same as us. The problem is that at this moment, it is busy to open up a 'shortcut' in the mountains. Of course, no matter what the real reason is, the first army can not miss this opportunity - at least before the north-south artery is connected, the two cities can not be lost." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and went on to say, "There are currently 3,000 troops stationed in the Shenchi Bay and the fine sand city, and the trenches and permanent fortifications are under construction. In addition, I also arranged a reserve team of 1,000 people, located behind the two cities, in order to support the front line at any time. However, this is still not enough insurance, I hope that Miss Sylvie can provide investigation and early warning for Shenchi Bay as in the past. And Lightning, Miss Mai, is responsible for the other one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ! "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; three at the same replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for Jinshiling and Fengxiaobao, I have arranged a team of 500 people to guard, but the two cities are far from the red fog area, the devil The possibility of launching a sudden attack is not great. Even if there is, it must be dominated by fearful beasts." The iron axe made a military ceremony to Tilly. "So I asked the Princess of the Dragon to take charge of the airborne warning in the area." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly nodded. "Reassure, the empty knight is born to fight against the beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The last is Dagong Island." The iron axe points to a large island on the east side of the map. "Although it will eventually be covered by red fog, it still has a very high strategic value. Unconnected with the land means easy to defend. The madman needs to cross the two or three kilometers of the strait to get to the island. As for the ability of the spiders to cross the river, there is still another problem. Flying fears can come and go freely, but the ability to attack is limited, and it can’t be done for the fortifications like bunkers. Too much trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as Dagong Island is in our hands, It will be much safer in the sinking bay below it. Similarly, it can also serve as a dagger across the enemy's waist - if you build an artillery in the city, you can cover the entire beachhead and the land within ten kilometers." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there is always a red fog area..." Ai Gesha worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
