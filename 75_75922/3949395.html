			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland spreads the letter and handed the wheat to a piece of beef jerky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" The latter opened his mouth and licked the meat, swallowed it in two or three, then squatted to the table and buried his head in the feathers. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See the letter, dear brother, or, "Hiram Roth. Wimbledon.""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I have received your letter, I agree with you. Although it is not clear why you suddenly turned your temper and changed your previous style, you are willing to help the witch, but since you have already Do, then the church becomes our common enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you already know, I became a witch, and this is everyone who wants to believe me." The reason, but you are a prince, an authentic aristocrat, can get the trust of many witches, it is very incredible. Since I know your news, I often think, how do you do this If you use the witch as a tool like other nobles, then it is impossible to get the approval of the ashes, and she will not choose to leave the wheat in the town of Bentham."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides, the steam engine mentioned by McMug and the knowledge promotion energy I am also very interested in the theory of force evolution. Especially the latter, I hope that I have the opportunity to talk to you about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for your invitation, I Thinking again and again, I found that I have no reason to refuse. The establishment of an alliance requires trust and dedication. If we are hesitant and timid, we will only make the church cheaper. Therefore, I will sleep most of the island’s auxiliary witches. The abilities are attached to the letter in the form of a list. You can pick the ones you need most and tell me through McMug. If all goes well, they will leave for your territory next month. It is best for security reasons. No more than five at a time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, please specify a reliable pick-up plan and send someone to protect. Every time you lose a witch, you will face the town. As for the island, it is a major loss, and it will cast a shadow over our cooperation. I hope that you can take care of them like a witch. If you can, please let them participate in the basics of the evening. Grant I believe that if any witch's ability can become stronger, it will be good news for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you said The church has already shown that it is a matter of time to annex the four kingdoms. I hope that when that day comes, you are ready to cope. If it is difficult to resist, the island is your refuge. Of course, I will give as much help as possible against the church invasion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the end, may we end the oppression of the church and build a new order - - A new kingdom that is not only a witch but a person who is not subject to persecution. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your sister, Tilly Wimbledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put down the stationery, The mood of the heart is unspeakable. He smiles and picks up the stationery, and pulls out a piece of beef jerky to reach the wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately reached out and took the food away. "Hey, hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched the silky feathers of the other's neck, and the latter squinted his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s hard, but lightning followed the fleet to the king, and it should be a few days to come back,” Roland smiled. “You can go to Nana. Play with tiles or leaves, or take a shower in the bathroom and get a good night's sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕...咕!" McMug swings his wings and then from the table The last jump, flying out of the window, quickly disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sentence she just said should be "not tired, I am going to find them to play", Roland found that even if the other person is talking in the state of the pigeons, he can I understand the meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... Is this the power of habit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he never imagined that Tilly actually promised her invitation and attached a list of witches’ abilities. This is a big treasure. ! Although the letter does not explain how long they can stay, it takes a half year to learn a complete primary education course. If you add 100,000 to yourself and the course is extended to one year, how much change can these witches bring to Bianbu Town? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
