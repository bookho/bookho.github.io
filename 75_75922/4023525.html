			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the castle hall in Chishuicheng is brightly lit, and the attendant walks through the crowd with the wine glasses. The musicians pluck the strings and sing softly. The food was served on the dining table, and the tall glass was filled with crystal red wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocrats and men and women gathered in a cluster, holding a glass of wine to talk and laugh, and Itis is the focus of everyone’s eyes, and is in contact with the counties of Delta. Between, it seems to enjoy it all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian feels that he is not incompatible with this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the shirt collar stretched his neck, the black jacket so that he could not even stretch his arms, not to mention the pointed high-heeled boots on his feet. It is difficult for him to understand how the nobles are wearing such awkward shoes on the smooth floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian can't help but admire Fanna, as the defender of the first military camp, he is at least not used to eat this bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when I think of what Itis said they represent Roland’s face, Brian’s waist can’t help but straighten up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes someone patted him on the shoulder. "It seems that you are very uncomfortable, do you attend this party for the first time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned back and the current person is Sir Sears. The other person wore a wide-shouldered dress with a white gauze around his neck. The momentum seemed to be very different in peacetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Relax, you don't have to be so nervous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not nervous - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a bad thing," the jazz waved. "Everyone has his own different things, which is normal."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian is silent for a moment, "What about an axe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am playing the role of a flower ambassador, "Sears points to the other side of the hall. "The popularity of Miss Effie and Miss Sylvie is no less than that of Miss Itis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brian looked in the direction he pointed, even though the dresses worn by both of them were temporarily found by Itis, and their expressions were stiff, but they were even more beautiful than the North Pearls. "Those people don't know their witch status, and the big man is not protecting the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," the jazz shook his beard, " is it "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Accurately, he is protecting those nobles," Brian nodded. "If Miss Effie fires, the people around will suffer." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and laughed at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, now your look is much more natural."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... Brian gave a slight glimpse and then realized, "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, you're welcome," the old man recruited a waiter, picked up a glass of wine, and then looked at it. To him, "Would you like a cup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... Your Majesty said that soldiers must not drink alcohol during the mission."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not at rest?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a rule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well," he took a sip on his own. "That's a pity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think..." Brian hesitated, " Are the words that Miss Itis said really true?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“For example?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the knight is outside, he represents his majesty. You should not arbitrarily refuse such an invitation because of courtesy."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
