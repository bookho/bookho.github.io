			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to recalling Ajima and Rother, he also wrote down the follow-up arrangements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a time-consuming and laborious task to safely mine uranium. It requires not only detailed operational procedures, monitoring nodes, but also workers. I have a certain understanding of the work I do, and I am conscientious in doing things according to the rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of an imminent threat of war, he naturally does not intend to follow the normal state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North Slope Mine is a good example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy the death penalty prisoners directly to the Duke of Quinn, and then put them into the ruins, without pay and holidays, and do not need to prepare protective measures for them. As long as the promise is released after ten years, he believes that those people will make the right choice between the gallows and the first-line life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And local lords are also expected to be willing to exchange these dregs for an extra income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the exploration team’s one hundred soldiers were only responsible for supervision and alert work, and the requirements for protection were greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn is undoubtedly the most suitable manager. At the end of the secret letter, Roland also deliberately confessed that the guards would explore the whereabouts of the "treasures" that people brought from the ruins hundreds of years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the suspicions in the rumor really made him care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unrecorded ethnic group seems to have an inexplicable admiration for radioactive elements, using ore to burn bricks to sacrifice temples and use it To torture the enemy, not even to swallow the ore - the testament of the green fluorescent in the eyes of Ajma is proof. Although it is not clear whether their demise is directly related to this kind of worship, it is a very appropriate name to call them radioactive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the world is so big, what kind of civilization is not unusual. What is really strange is that whether it is going deep into the mining area or taking ore to make bricks, it is impossible to cause the effect of "frozen flesh". Even if it lives in a mine, it has long been subjected to various internal and external exposures of decay radiation. As a result, the probability of cancer attack has soared. It could have lived eighty years old, but only lived to sixty-six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the efficiency of releasing nuclides by natural decay is too low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror of the tragic unlucky ones, not like death from cancer or distortion complications, seems to be affected by strong radiation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to satisfy the latter condition, only high-purity nuclear matter can be critical, and a large amount of neutron flux and hard gamma rays can be generated in an instant. It's just that this situation is not like the level that radiologists can achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland does not rule out that the rumor itself distorts the facts, but the horrors of the villagers should be known to more than one person. If it is true, the problem is likely to be in those "treasures". "on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to make the ruins take on the role of the altar of punishment - otherwise each detainee can live for more than a decade and die again. This altar is not built. If you are in a high-rise apartment building, you will not be able to accommodate so many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the time of hundreds of years far exceeds Axia’s retrospective period, and now it’s almost impossible to completely know what happened at the time, only Shawn Try to try it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He faintly felt that the truth behind the rumors might not be that simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the honey took the letter, Roland walked to the desk and shredded Looked at a spread of murals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the distorted ink image is full of weird and absurd things, he still recognizes the main subject and object - the body is mostly located in the center of the scroll, outline Large and exquisite, it represents the ruler of the remains; the objects are small, filled in all corners, and can feel pain and fear from their sly expressions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
