			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All curtains were lowered and the fireplace flames burned to maintain the room at a comfortable temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between Anna and adulthood is that Nana Wa is awake. In order to ensure that she can quickly gather spirit before the pain arrives, everyone will accompany her to tell a story, or play some simple games, so that she will not sleep and sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also performed a few coin magics, which made everyone look at each other, especially Nana, with his eyes staring at Roland’s hands. If it is normal, it is estimated that I have to learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of this era is still in the juggling stage of the big opening, the Roland has seen in the palace, there is a piper snake, mouth spit flame, chest Gravel slabs and the like, compared to the later generations, specializing in the small magic ratio of the eye and the finger skills, obviously fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is lightning telling about her sailing experience, walking with her father Thunder between the island and the fjord, crossing the whirlpools and reefs, hunting deep water giant sharks and octopus big Adventure. Although I know that more than half of them are invented, everyone listens with gusto, and even Roland is deeply immersed in it. In the picture he conceived, the sailboats became iron armored battleships, galloping on the vast expanse of the ocean, arriving. New World. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he did not understand the historical process of the world, and there are clear years of record, all of which ended more than 450 years ago. Recalling the knowledge that the prince learned at the court tutor did not mention the reason. Perhaps this guy did not listen carefully at all, he thought. There is no facility such as an archives or a library in Bianbu Town. After that, I won a long song fortress and asked a few scholars to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lightning finished the story of the adventure, Roland couldn’t help but yawn, he looked at the nightingale, and the latter shook his head, indicating that the magic had not changed. It is so inconvenient to have no accurate timing tools, and it is impossible to judge how long they wait. Roland poured himself a cup of warm water and sat down to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But gradually, everyone is aware of something wrong, this time is too long - Nanawa has been yawning again and again, seeing it will not support Living tired and slept, and the nightingale was anxious. She touched the little girl's forehead while staring at the magical operation of her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland picked up the cup and found that the water had dried up. He went to the fireplace and took off the kettle to refill himself. When he passed the window, he couldn't help but pick up the curtain and glanced at it. He wanted to see if the snow had changed. As the heavy curtains opened a small slit, a ray of light came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was pleasantly surprised to find that the black-painted sky had a white belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look!" Roland pulled the curtains open and everyone was alarmed by his shouts and turned back. Looking at the faint light in the distance, the people realized that a new day had arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa safely passed the magical day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Roland stretched back to the bedroom and found two more people in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night and Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no trace of drowsiness on their faces, only excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really confirm that Nana's "date" is today - not right, last night? Roland asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but the changes at the time were very subtle, I thought it was not a crucial moment to fight back," said the nightingale, "His Highness, Your statement is correct! As long as the magic is released, its total will continue to grow, but the suffering of the body will decrease. If you can maintain a certain amount of training every day, all witches have a great chance to live through adulthood! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The entire gray fort kingdom, only your territory allows the witch to exercise his ability without restraint. In a sense, this is the holy place of the witches." Mountain," Wendy continued. "I want to beg you, let as many witches know the news, and let the sisters come to the sanctuary as soon as possible." I think they will be willing to help you. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
