			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister, are you... planning to go far?" Cole Kant’s voice came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis continues to organize the clothes in his hands, and does not return to the head. "Not far away, it is a lap in the West."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many days?" The younger brother walked over to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No dresses, no belts, even you The favorite corset doesn't take..." Cole looked at the clothes piled up on the bed. "Isn't this trip going to visit the nobility, attending a dinner party, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The observation has improved, but there are some things that need not be said." Itis swept his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter suddenly shrank, "This is what you taught me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I will teach you a little more. Always be elegant when facing a woman. Think carefully about the wording. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you are my sister..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If not, you have already suffered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cole hit a Quiver, "I, I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good," Itis shrugged. "How does it feel to work in the City Hall?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's okay... I told you that I didn't reveal the identity of the nobility. It's usually just writing and recording. It's not difficult. I just don't understand..." The younger brother hesitated "Why don't you arrange me in your department?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the last time I watched the artillery drill, Cole Kant finally dismissed the return to the night. The idea of ​​the city, the two also moved from the diplomatic building The spacious residence near the castle is considered to be the official residence of the Winter City. As a nobleman with traditional education, it is not difficult to find a paperwork in the city hall. In addition, with nearly 100 scholars and attendants transferred from the north, she now has her own staff in the city hall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these people will not stay here all the time, but they will never refuse the people of insight who are constantly sending North to learn the new system. She knows the name. The young king has a thirst for talents and is willing to give him all the power to manage the managers. At present, there is still only one place in the north. As long as she keeps on changing, she can always occupy a foothold in her new regime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it is not necessary, and it is prone to errors," Itis smiled. "The general manager can usually stare at me if he is, Let him find your nephew, whether I help or not, it will be passive. The damage of Kant’s honor will also affect his views on me.” She paused, “even if the relationship between us is alienated. For outsiders, it is still a whole. So no matter what you do in the future, you must understand that you are not alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Er bowed his head, revealing a thoughtful expression. Itis doesn't know how much he can understand, but she can't help the other person to understand this kind of thing. Even if the aristocrats in the new government no longer exist, the influence of blood and surname will last for a long time, even In the short term, it will be more noticeable than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the sun sets, the moon becomes the brightest celestial body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, he nodded. "I will pay attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father The evaluation of the second son is timid, indecisive, and incompetent, and is not suitable to be the leader of the family. In particular, the first point is that in the era when the lords are always going to defend their homes with the knights, or when they are looting, the timid style of action can easily lead to subordinate dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis knew that his father had not said anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is Cole Kant like himself. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Fabioke’s breaking the order of the North, and eager to support the aristocrats who were not deeply rooted, the Kant’s family would still stay in the corner of the North, far away. Going to this step today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the absence of the winter city, these shortcomings become irrelevant... on the contrary, to a certain extent, it has become a kind of advantage, such as being cautious, not unassuming, and learning fast, all suitable for working in the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment when a group of civilians armed with snow powder weapons, and only one day to overcome the king’s capital, personal force and courage are no longer important, this is also From the very beginning, she insisted on leaving her brother in the absence of a winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, sister," Cole picked up a long skirt and compared it to himself. "Where are you going? I don't want to be alone." Staying in such a big room is boring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the beginning, but you asked to buy a big house, five hundred golden dragons even for me Isn't it a small amount, but you think it's too big now?" Itis asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No...no, no...I am very satisfied," Cole almost scared and dropped his clothes on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait until next summer, the third brother will come to no winter city, when you have a companion." She looked at each other's eyes, unexpected discovery The skirt that was covered in front of Kohl was very much in tune with him. I couldn’t help but raise an interesting thought. "As for where I am going, there is no secret of the winter city - I can’t tell you, but according to the old rules, you have to I paid a certain price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cole hesitated for a moment, this game is not stranger to the game for compensation, and he has been tricked by many, but Finally, curiosity still overwhelmed the fear of the heart, "I want to hear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis raised his mouth, "Western Snowy Mountain, with the same The army is acting together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is awkward, "Do you mean the source of the Chishui River? What is there?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unknown mixed-breed monsters, or alien enemies, it’s not unusual to encounter anything in the end," she said in the meeting about the victims of the Takula. Simply telling it again, "And we have a group of tentacle allies, monsters against monsters, it is really full of expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, etc... Cole opened his mouth and stuttered. "Are you not afraid at all? Your Majesty is actually dealing with monsters. Even if it is a devil, it will not grow into what you said!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So?" Itis did not hesitate to spread his hand. "Is this not a good thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Good thing?" Cole can't believe his ears. "Sister, are you okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed. "You remember, we voted for the king." What is the purpose of your majesty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because...higher power?" Cole cautiously replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not accurate enough, but it can't be wrong," Itis looked at him with eager eyes. "And power comes from the vast land and the people, if Even the ancients, the aliens, and even the devils have stood on the side of the Majesty. Doesn't that mean that the power we can share can reach all over humans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Cole took a cold breath and was clearly shocked by this statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Manage a small aristocrat in a village, you can call out the name of each citizen; and the lords of a town, it is difficult to do this. In the territory The more complicated the residents, the more broad the territory is. As for the kings who have incorporated the aliens into the rule, they have never appeared. Since the reason for leaving the northern boundary is that the land of the Duke is too narrow, why now? Worried about this kind of thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col stood in the same place, it took a long time for him to come back, "But..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they are different from us after all, right?" Itis snorted. "As long as His Majesty occupies a dominant position, then it is not what he wants to deal with." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col seems to feel a little chill in the heated room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
