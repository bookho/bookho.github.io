			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Hilli’s intelligence, the devil’s investigative team is usually made up of two madmen and three beasts, and will fly back and forth at a certain frequency. In the area of ​​the surveillance area, there is an overlap between the teams, and its posture is quite similar to the "Eagle Wall" of later generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the advantage of the air unit in the field of vision, the army will surely be discovered as soon as it enters the investigation area. What Roland intends to do is to open up a no-fly zone in the sky, a blind spot in the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is currently certain that the detective madman has neither a radar system nor an instantaneous call technology, as long as they are not allowed to blow the horn, the disappearance of a small team will not Cause any attention. The beasts equipped with the special red mist tank can enhance the patrol ability of the team, but it will also make the information feedback time longer. When the enemy finds that the beasts are damaged, they will wait until the evening to return to the nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, it’s not easy to find out where the devil of the specific loss location wants to locate the attacker immediately, not to mention the fact that the night investigating team is not acting, An army can march. As long as the production sequence of the blind zone is reasonable, it will be able to gain time for one's own side, which is equivalent to weakening the opponent's mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not expect to completely block the hand, even if it was delayed for two or three days, it would be of great help to the army - the sooner arrived at the bombardment site, his chances of winning It is bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the anti-terrorist sniper rifle is the product of his high hopes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is quite a gun, and in order to ensure long-range lethality and ballistic stability, its caliber is set at 20 mm. This is the dividing point between the gun and the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why not do it bigger, it is because Andrea's ability has a distinctive feature - it must be hand-held to launch. This point has been tested during the shelling training, even if it is directed by the enemy, once she loosens the barrel, no matter how the soldiers adjust, they can't do the static shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the recoil of the artillery forced to open fire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly does not blame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the name of the sniper was too awkward, so Roland decided to give it the name of the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new weapon itself has no high-tech technology, its structure is much simpler than the Mark-1 heavy machine gun, air guide rear seat, semi-automatic shooting, magazine The only extra component is the muzzle retractor, which is used to reduce the rear seat. It has also been applied to the main gun of the shallow water heavy gunship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took only two days to manufacture it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day and a half spent on screening materials and post-processing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alloy made by Lucia, Anna's cutting, candlelight curing and the magic of Doris...There are several witches teamed up to create In terms of quality, the weapon is definitely a legendary creation. The material and processing accuracy are not mentioned. As long as the curing effect exists, the sniper barrel will not be deformed under high temperature gas and huge pressure, which is also a key factor to ensure continuous and accurate shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a sniper rifle?" Andrea looked at it for a while, and soon found something wrong. "Where is its scope?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Roland is a handkerchief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No?" She groaned. "I can't hit the invisible target."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"And the general scope can't play its role, so there are three other people to help you," Roland said, looking over to Sylvie, Speer and Camilla. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean... let Ms. Camilla connect me with Sylvie, and then the Earl is responsible for adding magic?" Andrea I finally understood the meaning of "They are waiting for you". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I don't want to leave the Dragon Ridge... Ah, Auntie... but look at my sincere invitation to me so much, It can only be awkward to answer." Earl Sper was pretending to be helpless. "Only next time I hope to inform you earlier, instead of letting the Mai Mai girl fly with me - I am older. The body is not as good as it was when it was blown by the wind until now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camilla's reaction was much simpler. "His Royal Highness wants me to do my best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not sure, under the observation of the Eye of Magic, Whether my ability can still take effect." Because the range of the stone and the bow and arrow is far less than the visual range, Andrea has not considered similar problems before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So it’s necessary to try," Roland said. "So... get started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter Lannes is nervously squatting outside the bedroom door . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rarely had such uneasiness in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, except for Roland’s unprepared approach to the witch Anna, the second is today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife Mey is about to usher in childbirth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she said, "her status is comparable to that of the King," Carter thought. Take a little bit of effort and see if you are all stunned. Isn't that a child? Nana Va and Miss Lily are both there. There are several female nurses in the hospital. What problems can I have? Even if it is difficult to produce, according to His Majesty, you can also take the child directly out of the stomach and take care of the lives of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this idea just came out for a while, and soon it was shaken again... Can people really cut off the belly production? This is also terrible, no, no, no, still hope that normal is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Double, how dare you doubt the knowledge of Roland! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...have never heard of who came out like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two voices played in the mind of the chief knight, almost making him a head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, adult," Irene comforted. "May sister will be able to come over, because... she is the strongest person I have ever met." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other members of the Star Flower Troupe who came to visit also nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Carter said in his mouth, but his fears did not decrease. Under the entanglement, he felt a layer on his forehead. Fine sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there was a violent cheer outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the window and saw that in the lanes of countless people, a team wearing new military uniforms slowly walked across the long street and headed for the border wall. . The brown and green fabrics were clearly disorganized, but on these soldiers, they gave birth to a rock-solid sense of calmness. The whole army was like a flowing land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today is the day of the expedition?" Carter could not help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, my husband is also inside," Irene smiled a little, but full of pride. "He has been looking forward to this battle of revenge." It’s been a long time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Revenge?” He subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! In order to comfort those who have died in the hands of the devil, he said this to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The former star knights will now fight for ordinary people; the ideal country mentioned in the past is now a little bit of reality. And he should have been one of them, even the first one to rush to the front, and I don’t know when he is getting farther and farther away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the annoyance replaced the dispute in the brain, leaving him a little distracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a tender cry came from the bedroom door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, all thoughts have become blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
