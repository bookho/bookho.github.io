			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Roland immediately rushed to the back garden - although he wanted to save with Anna first, but the devil's red fog is limited, it must be tested as soon as possible . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Witch Alliance are almost all in line, even if they are not participating in the test, and do not want to miss the opportunity to observe the enemy at close range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madman who was taken off the limbs has been controlled by the wind, and is lying quietly in the middle of the board room. Roland is the first time to see him completely different from human beings. The alien creature. Its physique is huge, and it is even higher than the iron axe. The frozen arm has the thickness of the thigh of an adult. The muscles of the block are sharp and angular, and the top is covered with blue veins. At first glance, it feels extremely powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its rough skin appears blue-black, considering that the devil's blood is blue, this color is normal. Roland reached out and touched each other's body, and they could clearly feel the heat. This proves that they have a faster basal metabolism. In a sense, the faster the metabolism, the lower the adaptability of the species to the environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the mad magic respirator is closely connected to the helmet, it is temporarily unable to see its appearance, but overall, it is obvious that the other is also a high-grade chordate Compared to the more exaggerated heart and the lord of hell, the madman is still a personal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, according to Ai Gesha, such low-level devils have extremely low intelligence and cannot be compared with human beings. To be more sophisticated, high-order The devil is more like a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the five devils, the demon is melted by the divine, and one of the devils is chopped by Anna. The remaining three cans of red fog are already on the road. I used two cans.” Ai Gesha licked her forehead and looked a little tired. The sound was much slower than usual. “The fog is supported until tomorrow evening, so if you want to make a seal, the test cannot exceed the noon tomorrow. - I need half a day to smelt the base, which may fail several times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red fog has fatal damage to the witch, how do you replace the gas tank? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the mortal help to pick up the pipe," she said, pointing to the bone container on the side. "These used storage tanks are also brought along." Come back, maybe later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded, then looked at the wind, "Can you control it using magic?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it can do this," the latter replied, "I don't need specific manipulation." Every move of the target, but similar to the order, forcing the other party to obey my order. This command is beyond the limits of language and thinking, even if the evil beast will obey - of course, not too complicated."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good," he instructed Nana Voda. "First connect the limbs. I want to see the power and spacing of the mad magic spear."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, in the castle?" Lily frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery, hummingbirds, etc. immediately hid behind Wendy, but the white paper and Axia reaction that had not experienced the failure of the co-help society were not so strong, their faces More is curiosity than fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any problem?" Yu Yu muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, let us watch it," Iphi said calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dinner, Roland had a general understanding of the melting point action, completely unexpected high-level devils made the team busy, and once in danger, but the witch Our joint efforts finally defeated the strong enemy, of which Effie played a very important role. In particular, after the failure of the divine signature, her determination to fight for time for everyone has greatly changed the views of other witches, and her attitude towards non-combat witches has also become calmer – the slight transformation during this period may not even Ifi is not aware of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may take a long time for her to truly integrate into the group, but in Roland’s view, there has been at least an opportunity for integration on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa looked down unwillingly and began to treat the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is conventional medicine, there is absolutely no way to complete this "surgery". In the absence of antifreeze, the frozen limb can only prevent spoilage, but can not prevent moisture. Icing destroys its organizational structure. However, under the unreasonable magic repair, the condition of the broken limbs has obviously improved, and even those mottled burn marks have faded a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
