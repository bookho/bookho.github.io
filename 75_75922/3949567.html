			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did he see? A system that is out of the external energy supply and is still generating electricity on its own! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association into the mystery of the moon is an enchantment type, the answer is simply coming out, she has given a new feature to the metal frame, using magic to provide a source of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you do it?" Roland exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that electricity and magnetism are interrelated and an inseparable whole. I can’t help but think that since my ability can make objects magnetic, then Can it also make it thunder? You said that creating a lightning requires a magnetic change, and I tried to attach the repeatedly changing magnetic force to the copper wire, and the result became like this..." Mystery Month replied cautiously, in the eyes Full of expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that...The prince thought that the current does generate a magnetic field, but the magnetic field does not unconditionally generate current, the latter must act on the closed coil and have magnetic flux Change – whether changing the magnetic area or changing the magnetic force, requires external energy to achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new ability of the mystery month replaces this part, so that the magnetic force changes itself without external interference. If it is put in before, Roland will definitely think that this is A model of perpetual motion, but now he understands that the power of a witch cannot be measured by common sense - the magnetics of the enchantment do not necessarily come from the magnetic pole, just as the black fire is not a fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all the magic effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His only curious thing is that he never noticed the magnetic change of the enchanted object before the mystery month? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland asked this question, she nodded first, but soon shook her head again. "When I helped the meeting, I also thought about letting objects The magnetic properties can be changed at will, and the magnetic force can be reduced when not in use, so as not to cause trouble to other sisters, but it seems to have no effect. The magnetic properties of the object are always maintained at a fixed size. I thought that this idea could not be realized, and I did not try again." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Roland asked for the night, "her magical form..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It has already condensed," the nightingale emerged from the fog and smiled. "It is like a surging blue water wave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the mysterious moon suddenly excited Get up, "Don't I really--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, your abilities have evolved," Roland said. "There is no long-term practice. It’s impossible to understand the key to promotion so quickly, you’re doing very well. From today, you’re the sixth in the Witch’s League. Evolutionary ability sorceress "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" Congratulations, "Nightingale smiled and walked over and patted her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, can I do more for my Highness now?" Mystery Moon gleamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, how many countless," Roland curled his lips. "As I said before, your potential is limitless. But... first Take a good rest, your dark circles are as big as your fists. Wait until the afternoon, let me test your abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" !" She nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the mystery left the office, the nightingale immediately closed the door and came over. She didn't go back to the table or the floor-to-ceiling window as usual, but a flash close to Roland, excitedly holding his shoulders and bending over the waist - the pale blond hair fell on the cheek, making him feel slightly itch. Looking at the other side's watery eyes and soft red lips, Roland's heartbeat suddenly increased several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;诶? What's happening here! Is she wanting to be here with herself... but it is still daylight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me how to do it." The words of the nightingale let the prince glimpse, and so on... The story seems to be different from what I think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What method?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can also evolve without understanding the theoretical foundations of natural sciences." The method," she said excitedly. "With the test scores of the mystery month, it is impossible to understand the contents of this book, but you still let her evolve a new ability! What should I do? Do you practice with "small toys"? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
