			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis returned to her residence, took off her coat and left it on the hanger at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich fragrance in the living room made her take a deep breath, and the dry lips suddenly spit out saliva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defense did not feel that when the meeting was held, it was only now that the stomach was already screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is it so late today?" Cole’s voice arrived first, then he poked his head out of the doorframe and held a spoon in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a lot of work to be done by the Ministry of Defense, especially when it comes to the morning sun. The situation is even more complicated." She licked the skin. Boots, put on a soft sock, and walk into the living room. "You will come back later, you should eat it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care," He grinned. "But isn't you still not deciding whether or not to take care of the Lord of the Morning? Plan now. If he adopts the strategy of Barov's side, are you not busy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really think he has no idea?" When Iisi passed by her brother, he patted his head. "Roland Wembleton is not a The king who took the idea with his hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you see?" Cole curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to know, you have to pay the price." She glanced at the other side, and the latter suddenly trembled and stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two dishes and one soup on the table, the main ingredients are no special products of the winter city - bird kiss mushrooms. I don’t know that I’ve picked more hunters recently, and I’ve found new sources. This kind of mushroom is very delicious, and the mushrooms containing juice begin to appear in the convenience market. At the same time, the price does not rise and fall, and there is a faint substitute for meat. the trend of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the bird mushroom is difficult to store for a long time because of its fat characteristics, otherwise it is an excellent sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis puts a slice of grilled mushroom in the mouth, the slightly fragrant mushroom cover and the melted butter are perfectly joined together, and the crisp sound is felt after the sound The entire mouth was filled with juice, and she snorted with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admit that she had previously looked down on this younger brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides being incompetent and indecisive, Cole’s talent in learning exceeds her expectations – just like cooking, the practice of these mushrooms is only I have eaten once or twice at the banquet held by my Majesty. It is also like a decent, and there is no dexterity to do this. The same is true of the paperwork in the City Hall. Just a few months after it started, it has already appeared as a formal recorder at the major meeting of the Lord’s Castle. This speed has surpassed many peers, and the Northland gang is considered to be excellent. The aristocratic children may not be able to do better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the most important thing is that he still listens to his own words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, Isis feels that dinner is more delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the stronger your ability, the easier it is to do things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister..." When he was halfway through, Cole couldn't help but open his mouth. "Why didn't you speak at the conference these days?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" She put down the spoon and picked her eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland is asking what you are good at? Since you saw your intentions, why not tell him?" Cole muttered. "You didn't see Barry looking at you...the smug smiles are overflowing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also a secret, By convention - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." He bowed his head and revealed a distressed expression. After hesitating for a long time, he shook his head and seemed to want to push his curiosity into his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But look at the dinner that tastes good, just as you have already paid the price." Itis raised her lips slightly. "How much do you know about Andrea in the Witch Alliance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
