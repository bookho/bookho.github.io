			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belly is still licking, and the banquet is still to be eaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of the dinner was fairly harmonious. The four princes did not talk about the ore. He could not say anything more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the prince told the maid to change the dessert, Peitro tentatively said, "His Highness, according to past practice, today should be the day of delivery of ore. However, I did not see any ore at the dock yard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put down the small wooden stick in his hand and nodded. "Unfortunately, the former slope of the North Slope Mine The hole has collapsed. My people have been trying to resume production this month. However, the gravel in the collapse has not been cleaned up. According to this progress, the mining area is only going to be delayed until next year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collapse? Pei Luo spent a moment, so smart? But he quickly realized that the other party did not have to lie to himself. Otherwise, going to the north slope will make it clear that the obvious lie is to hit your own face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where... two months before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not too much, by convention Then, the stone can't afford my people." Roland added a tone to the word convention. "Mr. Ambassador, should you remember the month of the demon two years ago?"<br /><br />&nbsp Pei, of course, remember that the cold that lasted for four months caused nearly 20% of the people in Bianque Town to starve to death. The reason was that the municipal officer Ferreno was insatiable. There was no voice inside the nobility, and some even asked to punish Ferreno afterwards. But in the end this incident was gone, only because he was the husband of the duke's second daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the prince mentioned this, Peor’s heart raised a bad feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time is even worse," Roland sighed. "If you deliver in the same way as before, I am afraid I can only switch to a two-month share of wheat. My The people can't survive the winter, sir, the past trade methods must be abolished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyro opened his mouth, but did not know how to refute. He is not a professional diplomat. In the face of sufficient reasons, he really can't pick a problem. He has to delay the road. "His Royal Highness, I regret this matter. This time I will never repeat the tragedy before. I will Let the six families jointly lend a month's worth of food, and your people can wait for the next year to resume production and then slowly repay it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I sold it to Liuye Town, No need to repay it slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing good but Roland interrupted. "They are willing to use gold dragons to buy stones, and at the same time sell wheat, cheese, bread, honey at market prices. Anyone who can buy them with Jinlong, they all sell. Take a step back, Mr. Ambassador, even if Are you willing to lend a month's worth of food, and the other five will agree with your decision? As far as I know, the Duke of Ryan is not so easy to reach an agreement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Perot is silent, the four princes are right, not only the other five, he even his own He failed to convince the pro-grasp. In order to maintain the monopoly power, it is necessary to modify the trading plan, but he has no right to make a final decision. Said to be an ambassador, in fact, it is just a megaphone. Perhaps the Duke did not want anyone to personally reach any agreement with Bianbu Town? Whether the object is the former lord or the four princes. Therefore, he assigns different candidates every season, and these people are never the masters of the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the outcome, he always had to give it a try. Think of it here, Peiro gave up the final card, "30%," he extended three fingers, "The fortress." Buy ore and gemstones at a price below 30% of the market price. I think this price should be higher than that of Liuye Town, His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is a handkerchief, "It's really higher, but it's still an old question. Can you make six unanimous decisions if you say it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will return to the long song fortress tomorrow After the agreement, I will come with a new contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But my people can’t wait that long. You should know that the aristocrats want to reach Consistent, it is usually very time consuming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, working with the fortress is a better choice for you and your people. The town is too far away, although it can escape the demon moon there," Peer said that Pei’s eyes were a bit dry, "but the road is easy... dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
