			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, damn it! What shit prince is not a poor worm that has been thrown into the barren hills! Jules thought sullenly, but looking at the two guards holding the hilt and holding it behind him, he had to swallow the bad breath temporarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the castle gate, see the guard turned and left, the baron was relieved. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rubbed his wet hand rubbed his forehead, spit out a spit, and imagined the spit on the face of the prince. The light was not enough to deflate, and he slammed his feet on the sputum, and his heart was comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about blocking the evil beast, do you think you can stand firm in the West? Continue to be proud of it, see how long you can still be proud! Juris thought, if he did not receive reliable information, he would not want to come to Bianbu Town early. Generally speaking, the nobility will return to the town later than the civilians. After all, mining and hunting are not enough for them to work. It only takes a while to go to the mine to supervise the production situation and wait for the day of ore delivery. . In your spare time, you can go to the Orion's home to see if you have the right quality fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this year has changed, and Jules heard from the chief financial officer Ferreno that the Duke of Ryan is ready to drive the four princes out of the West - this is not a betrayal The Kingdom of Fort, but adhering to the will of the new king Tiefko Wimbledon: "Roland Wimbledon is no longer the lord of Bentham, the new territory needs him to re-enclose after returning to the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is the adult of Ferreno, but the red man in front of the Duke, in just five years, climbed from the city official to the position of the chief financial officer. If it is not through the relationship between distant relatives, he will be given two good furs every year, and how can he know the minds of the Westerners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Returning to the king to re-enclose the territory after the debriefing" is just a good statement, even Jules knows that the big prince is not said to be sent to the guillotine. of. The four princes are going back this time, but they are not at the mercy of the new king? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the West is the western realm of the Dukes. If it is only the unilateral order of the Fife, it remains to be discussed. But when the Duke was ready to go out in person, Roland Wimbledon was no different from the dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason why Jules rushed to the border town, one wants to collect some fur early, and the other is to dispose of the house. The first point is that his abacus is very savvy. In the past years, the civilians here have escaped to the long song fortress to take refuge. Naturally, there is no inventory, but this year they have been staying here, how can they receive a few good goods? Not only can you make a small profit, you can also give a tribute to Ferreno. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that Jules Barto Ferreno has arranged a seat for himself in the town hall. Although it is a leisurely job, it is better than this damn poor place. . The house is not used, of course, it is good to get rid of it as soon as possible. Who knows when the Duke will start, and if the gangs are reluctant to burn their houses, they will lose money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he never imagined that the house was not burned to the people, but the four princes were directly dismantled. I think that the baron here is so angry that it is a good house! Although one hundred and fifty gold dragons are somewhat exaggerated, how the thirty golden dragons are worth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to get the money early, he retired and retired, and twenty of them reluctantly accepted it, but His Royal Highness treated himself like this! A coin is not taken out, and he threatens himself with the crime of defection. He does not know the month of the demon, will all the nobles evacuate from this place? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait...寇里斯 slowed down and suddenly felt something was wrong. Although I heard that the four princes had a bad personality, they had no heads and brains. When they first arrived in Bianbu Town, they also maliciously harassed the wife of the Baron Simon, who was privately talked about for a long time, but the feeling of meeting today is totally different. . The prince did not become angry or ignorant, and the expression of his attitude was not good with his character and his head. The other party has been talking to himself in the usual tone. Why was it so scared that he gave up the ownership of the house? Is it a matter of killing the house, and can the prince really kill him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right... Jules couldn’t help but shudder, and the sweat on his forehead shrank back. Looking back now, when he faced the prince, he had the illusion of talking to the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron shook his head and shook his unpleasant memory behind his head. Anyway, the four princes couldn't be stunned for a few days. When Ryan's adults returned to Bianbu Town and took Roland Wimbledon to Wangdu, he had to laugh at him. Maybe these twenty golden dragons can also ask the Duke to ask for justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
