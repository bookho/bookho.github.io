			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty opened his eyes and some strange roofs came into view. There are wooden beams hanging from spider webs, gray masonry ceilings, and a ring chandelier that has never been lit. The scene is blurred to clear, until every detail is presented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a cold rocky roof or a narrow tent, she thought, yes, I have left the co-help club for more than half a month, I don’t know if the tutor is leading. Sisters have successfully found the holy mountain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath, although not as refreshing and cold as the cave, but the dull and warm atmosphere in the room made her feel comfortable too. The body is wrapped in soft velvet silk, and there are several layers of cotton blanket underneath. When you lie down, it will sink slightly. Even if the body is completely stretched, the toes will not reveal the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of not getting up in bed made her feel a little embarrassed, and she came here for half a month, but she had a long-lost feeling of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the castle, no matter how late, no one bothered her. For example, now Wendy leaned over and looked out the window, and the gray sky was even glaring. At this time, it has probably passed the fox time (10 o'clock). In the past few years, there are few times when you can sleep peacefully. A little bit of noise will wake up from your dreams, and when the day is not bright, you have to start preparing for today's food. When you go out, you are worried that you will be found by the church. No one can guarantee to live the next demon pharynx. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if she is hiding in the mountains, she should have been busy with chores, or help to dry food and herbs, and blow dry clothes that are wet by the sisters. Or cleaning up camps, etc...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter is not unwilling to do this, she will feel happy when she sees everyone’s smile. But she found that for such a lazy life, he could not resist himself, but was somewhat immersed in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no more lazy. She patted her cheek and drummed up from the bed. After all, in the monastery, the nun always warned that the lazy man could not be blessed by the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, go to the back garden to practice the wind control, and blow off the snow by the way. Thinking of His Royal Highness's request for practice, Wendy couldn't help but want to laugh. That's all bizarre requirements - for example, after watching the ability demonstration, I hope I can blow the wind to a distance ten steps above the top of my head. However, no witch has ever been able to extend the magic to such a distance. The defendant could not do it. He was not only not angry, but he came up with a weird idea: let yourself stand on the stool and let the strong winds blow up and down at the same time. Wendy tried it and found that this was a viable option. The test results made the prince of the prince very satisfied. In addition to letting himself practice more in this way, he also asked if he had a fear of heights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Nightingale said, His Royal Highness Roland Wimbledon is an elusive person, but he is also a prince who cares for the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I thought of this, Wendy sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince who does not hate the witch really exists, and the mentor is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; put on new clothes, the chest feels slightly swelled - Wendy has become accustomed to this kind of thing, just wanting to find a needle to change it At the time, a knock on the door sounded outside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is the nightingale, Wendy is slightly embarrassed Hey, then laughed. "Isn't you still getting up? You are free to come to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about, I am not available Follow him every day.” The nightingale raised the basket in his hand. “I brought you breakfast.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breakfast is usually delivered to the room by the maid. In addition to the prince's high school, the nightingale often comes to chat with himself, it is difficult to see her at other times. Wendy smiled at the bottom of her heart. When she woke up, she ran over to eat. She must have slipped in and saw herself several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, what's the matter?" She took the basket and squeezed a piece of bread with cheese from it and put it in her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." The nightingale went to the bed and sat down. "Nanawa will spend it today...that day."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
