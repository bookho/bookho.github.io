			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days after the train’s public appearance, no winter city was always filled with a high atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if sitting in the castle, Roland can feel the high spirits of the people - this is not from his speculation, but the actual report in the town hall. data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past three days, we have received more than 60% of the settlement applications, and nearly half of them, that is, 725 people migrated. Newcomers who are less than a month old! This is equivalent to reducing the average delivery time for settlement applications from five months to three and a half months!” Barov holds a report and dances. “And after the devil attack, the data was There has been a slight decline. Now it has not only filled the decline, but also has seen a substantial increase, indicating that the public’s worries about the devil are not enough! Your Majesty’s show is a great success!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Roland brought the concept of data statistics and comprehensive analysis to management, the number of reports in the town hall’s chief management report has increased and become more specific, as if the two groups of comparative data were not put It is impossible to draw conclusions in general. Not only that, but he also created a lot of analytical formulas, "arrival - settlement interval" is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Barov’s statement, it reflects the determination of the migrants to join the no-winter city – due to the establishment of the identity card system, the displaced people want to become official Residents must apply to the City Hall on the condition that they have a skill or a permanent residence. In addition, residents who have passed the review and have lived for one year without any bad records will be accepted by the City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For newcomers, wait and see is almost an instinct, plus the difference in work pay, not enough time for housing down payment The same is true, so the average value method is used. The shorter the interval, the more loyal the king and the more confident the new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has some different opinions on this conclusion. He has never believed in the loyalty of strangers. Confidence can still be said, but in the end, the people still pay most attention to Whether their future interests can be guaranteed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the thigh is a good choice at all times, so showing the strength at the right time can greatly increase the cohesiveness of the people. The train is undoubtedly such a tool - even if most people don't know its essence, it does not hinder the burly body, roaring cylinders, and the pressure of hundreds of tons of weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it sailed past the Castle District crossing with a head-on force, even the Thunder were stunned – unlike the sea, the confrontation with gravity on the earth was always constrained. The upper limit of land traffic, and the appearance of the train clearly broke the situation. He even laughed that when he was too old to take risks, he must move the whole family to live without the winter city. After all, there are so many new things here. Settling here is an adventure in itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most famous explorers in the fjord are so amazing, not to mention the ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a promising place, can you choose where to go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, the City Hall has received invitations from many businessmen, including many of the Chishui and Silverlight Chambers." Barov went on, "They are eager to hope." Seeing you on the side, it is estimated that you want to inquire more about the train."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All refused," Roland smiled. "The train is currently Not a commodity, even if I am willing to sell, the price is not affordable. But you can sell them to other goods – such as the first and second generation steam engines that have been replaced from the mine.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no winter city now. It is no longer the poor and well-behaved Bianque Town. It is a Chamber of Commerce that can get the lord’s interview. If there is no special friendship, let the City Hall Manager It is enough to deal with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand," the latter touched his beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the public's mood is high, can the new reserve system be implemented?" Roland changed the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baroph nodded. "I think there should be no problem. But...hey, do you really think we will hit that point?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Just in case. It’s a war that determines the fate of mankind. Should you be serious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
