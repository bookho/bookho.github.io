			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While walking in the jungle has greatly slowed down the progress, but it is safe and sound on the way. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three days, about a group of people from the border, unexpectedly met a team of gray-sold soldiers searching along the road - that unique The brown fur uniform and the long metal tube behind him let him recognize the other person's origin at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After following the army and returning to Yong Yee City, after meeting with the Duke of Kant, he realized what happened to him - directly from Roland, who received Hill’s report Two secret letters, one indicating that the first army unit originally stationed in the town of Glen Valley was divided into four teams, entered the morning from the four junctions between the two countries, and accepted the diplomats who retreated. The other one informs the Duke of Northland to enter the state of readiness. In other words, it is to start raising food, cotton, horse-drawn carriage and other combat materials. Once the main force arrives in the north, it can directly start operations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the messenger group is safe and sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he said this, the Duke even gave a sigh of relief, and he was flattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what most touched him was the reaction of old friends to the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he knows that the four witches in the team account for a large proportion, in the secret letter, the name of the ambassador Joel is still mentioned. He was in the right position, and this treatment made him feel that the fright and tossing all the way was worthwhile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jordan wrote a long letter in the process of evacuation and handed it to the Duke, hoping that he would be able to lift the North after receiving this letter. War preparation status - Now he finally knows that Hill did not make a mistake, and his attitude toward this matter is not casual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, he was also surprised by the response of the First Army, minus the time when the flight messenger sent back and forth, meaning that the original day of the order was received. The forces used to watch out for the remnants of the church and the evil beasts took action. He has not seen the nobility to fight the troops. It is only half a month's effort to summon the knights, mercenaries and free people, not to mention the task of group execution. As long as the team spreads out, there are fewer people supervising, and those mercenaries who get the advance payment will probably run out one night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably why old friends can break into the capital of the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just about it now faintly understands that his army is different from what he has seen before - not only weapons, but in every respect Far better than those nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time as an ambassador, he is not an isolated person. The whole kingdom is not only his backing, but also his sharp edge. At the thought of this, he felt his chest rise so badly that it seemed like a flame was burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that makes Yoon so worried is that there is only one person on the 76th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the prior agreement, the first-time visitors will hang a four-color flag in the prominent position of the residence, and the Duke of Kant sent people to find Yongyongcheng all over again. Did not see a similar sign. Now they lived in the residence of the Duke, and they simply set up a flagpole directly at the door, letting the bright four-color canvas flutter in the wind. Just enter the inner city and you will see this mark at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, not only is he alone worried about each other, through the window, Joel often sees Anne and Amy standing under the flagpole, apparently wanting to I saw the return of peace on the 76th. As he gets along, Anne's attitude toward him is also a little bit different, at least not as sly as he used to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill’s men have been looking for him more than once, hoping that he will leave for the West as soon as possible, and the magician even tells him directly, as a tempter, seventy-six The chances of survival are minimal. If the knights are not chasing them, she should arrive at the border village one day later and then reach Yongyong City faster than their group. Now that they have agreed to the meeting place, there is still no movement, and the result is basically doomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe also understands this truth, but he still wants to wait a few more days, not for anything else, just for the words when she left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the storm passes, I will join you again - just in the border city of Grey Fort, you remember to wait for me there."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
