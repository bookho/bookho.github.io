			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of the fireplace swayed twice, gradually dimming, the nightingale appeared, and filled with a few firewood. There was a creaking sound in the stove, and the flame suddenly brightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at the elongated shadow of the cup and spit out his breath. Tilly has been away for a while. He has been thinking about the conversation between the two and see if there is any way to change the result, but after all, he has not found the answer. Trust is a wonderful thing, except for investing time. Other methods have had little effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was something you couldn't do," the night slap took the dust on the hand and walked over to sit back in her old position. "What the day is. What did you say to her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good faith lies," Roland leaned back on the chair. "She doesn't want to believe it is normal." He paused. Don't, "You used to say that you have a younger brother. If he suddenly becomes very different from the past and emphasizes that he is still himself, would you believe him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You mean that guy who looks innocent and turned around and betrayed me?" The night screamed. "In my opinion, he is basically no different from a mutation."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I shouldn't mention this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, anyway, I have left the Gülen family, they It’s just a stranger.” She didn’t think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I and she have been like strangers," Roland sighed. "Or, I don't get along well with everyone in the palace." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are bored, let me know." The nightingale smiled. "I have been very curious about life in the palace and I want to know you." How bad the character was at the time, and the bad reputation could be passed to Silver City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be honest, I was much worse than now," Roland I couldn't help but curl up my mouth and pick up a few memories of the past. "From the moment I fell into the glass slag, she began to hate me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really...worse," she groaned. "But I think she doesn't hate you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh "Roland picked a brow. "Do you know that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, she didn't say a few words - "In private, I also hope very much Here, learn the interesting knowledge "," imitation Nightingale said, "Sounds like comfort of the speech, but the fact is, she was not lying when saying these words. If you are really disgusted in the past, you would not want to stay here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you comforting me? Roland laughed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the truth is stated," she shrugged. "And I feel that it is good to maintain the status quo." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She promised to give priority to the town to provide a witch, to support you against the devil, then there is no difference here. If the sleeping island witches all come in, there are a few guys like the ashes, I am going to be busy," the nightingale threw a fish in his mouth and muttered. "Not everyone is like a wheat stubble." That obedient. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn't help but laugh out. "Listen to your statement, you seem to have been looking for ashes?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? No, how can I do it," said the nightingale, "only occasionally staring at her, in case she is not good for the Witch Alliance members. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned to the beginning and whistled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if it is an illusion," Roland stared at her. "Why did I feel that you were really happy after I was rejected? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the illusion," the nightingale sure, then she looked in the direction of the door. "Hey, someone is coming." "The body shape has been hidden.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
