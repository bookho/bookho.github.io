			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, this is the financial situation this week," Barov received From the report in hand, I was excited and excited. "In general, the rising trend of various data is better than expected. It is said that it is a big increase. If it is put in the past, this is definitely a miracle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it’s done well," Roland sat on his chair, looking a little calmer than the other. He naturally knows what the miracle of the old minister is referring to – ignoring the influence of the demon moon, and the population and economic growth has exceeded the summer and autumn seasons that should have been the peak season, as if the heavy snow outside the window does not exist. For people of this era, this report is completely subversive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, when the winter falls, people’s activities change from accumulation to consumption. Just like hibernation, economic performance is not common. The former Bianbu Town was directly abandoned, and even people were gone. What about trade production? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows that the essence of hibernation is nothing but a compromise of the environment. Human beings can stand out from the thousands of creatures, relying on the ability to transform the environment - - The cement ship, which ignores the wind direction and never tires, breaks the barrier of snow cover. The heating system and the medical center solve people's worries. The work in the factory is even more fearless - when the environmental restrictions are a little widened. This day will come sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the establishment of the throne and the new king are also a key to the rise of data: people always love to run in a lively place, this has been for thousands of years No change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wide-scale Chishui River now appears to be somewhat crowded – the cement ship built without the winter city broke through the 500 mark as early as the year before, and its template A variety of modifications have been developed from the original flat-panel transport ship. It is possible to quickly install upper hulls such as passenger transport and commercial space by reserving slots, which has been favored by many chambers of commerce. Coupled with the business opportunities of large-scale population migration, cement ships have appeared in the docks of other cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the news of the thriving spread out, there are five or six hundred people who arrive through the river in the winter without a winter city. A year ago, Barov thought that 100,000 people were The goal is difficult to achieve, and now the total population of the West is close to 200,000, of which 90% are in the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also led to the new king being completely different from other traditional cities - it has neither a majestic city wall nor an inner and outer city, but a circle Another round of streets is divided into sections, which are constantly expanding outwards, just like a forest made up of a house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the style of the house is similar, and the lack of finely crafted buildings, no winter city has been criticized by many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these words fall into Roland's ear and become another kind of boast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, how can winters withstand the rapid growth of the population? To know that 200,000 means the sum of the number of permanent residents in the rest of the city. If you have to use the wall to circle it, then build some fine buildings such as the cathedral, the bell tower, and the palace of the king. I am afraid that it will not take decades. time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population is the foundation of industrialization, the guarantee of opening more factories, and the premise of economic prosperity. As for what is beautiful, it is not within his consideration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in his eyes, the rows of steaming chimneys are much more beautiful than the palatial palaces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And given the lag in the spread of news, growth next year should be even more alarming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to stay, you will get the reward you deserve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Become yours The King's hand is the best reward - and these changes come from your wise decision, I just do what you want," Barov smugly touched the beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head with a funny smile. "Do you have anything else to report?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Ah...Yes, Your Majesty," the boss managed to take two letters out of his mind. "Although these two letters were sent to the Executive Office, I feel that only you can make a decision."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
