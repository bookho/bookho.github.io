			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering the enemy’s large forces, Locar’s heart was clear that he had to evacuate – as Roland’s chieftain and lightning said, The opponent is not something she can handle alone. It is important to send the news back to the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has proved herself in the previous battles, and if the devil is rooted here, she will have many opportunities to play against this group of monsters in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she made a judgment in her head, she did not choose to leave the first time, but planned to find a high point to see the movement of the devil. Just a sentence, "I saw a lot of devils" is easy to make people think that she has escaped from the wilderness. If she can bring back more information, even the chieftain will have to accept her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, regardless of whether the other person’s words are concerned or ironic, they will not break their minds – she does not want to apologize, but It is recognition. Even in the battle of life and death, she can play a sideline role. To the light, this is her personal glory, and said in the deep, this is great for improving the weight of the fandom clan in the heart of the great chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she did it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, these ideas she won’t say straight, just simply describe it as curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia quickly found an abandoned stone tower not far from the ruins of Takira, although the tower was almost half-destroyed and covered with moss and vines, but also The best observation point nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to facilitate the evacuation, she did not put on her clothes, but instead carried the bag behind her back and wrapped it in a cloak to climb the top of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big hole that broke open at the top just for her body, plus the curtain-like rattan, the fearful beast that flew overhead from several times failed to find her trace. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she finally saw the true face of the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not a living thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are not... alive?" Wendy asked, and Wendy asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only think so," Luo Jia whispered. "Those guys don't look like a creature, it's like..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the inverted image?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The iron bridge you built on the Chishui River." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people looked at each other and it was difficult to understand at the moment, "Bridge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was then ...and it’s incredible, but it’s the truth,” she coughed weakly. “It has a straight trunk like a bridge deck. The four long legs are like the piers on the sides of the body, just... no matter the torso Still on all four limbs, there is no flesh and blood covered. Through the hollow skeleton and iron piece, I can clearly see the scene behind the monster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter I couldn't help but take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A steel bridge that can act on its own? Is this something that the devil made? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia said after a short pause, "Each skeleton monster is at least eighty-nine feet tall, and its top is fixed with many devils. Going, it is like a layer of eggs, and its abdomen is hung with a huge skin, like an organ peeled from something, not only can feel its pulsation, but also through the epidermis The dark red mist that surged inside.” She clenched her fist and gently pressed it to her chest. “The three gods are on, and the appearance of those monsters is simply evil.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash frowns, "...and then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then they crouched around the ruins, and hundreds of tubes fell in the skin The child was inserted into the ground, and the surrounding land turned into a dark brown agglomeration. The weeds and trees above quickly withered, as if something had been drained from life. Most of the devils also sank into the ground, only Leaving hundreds of madmen and more than ten beasts to continue activities around the ruins, it should be responsible for patrol investigations. .
