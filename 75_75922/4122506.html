			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha - owed -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Loja climbed out of the warm bed When the head is still faint, there is some pain. She licked her mouth and left the lingering fragrance of strawberry white wine between her lips and teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems...and drink too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢呜..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but make a low from the scorpion whimper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This state has been going on for more than a week since it was returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "culprit" is naturally the chief of Roland Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the witches who participated in the battle received a generous reward, with a few dozens of banknotes and more than a hundred. As a striker, she also won 35 prizes. When converted into Jinlong, there are almost one hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war, this is a common occurrence. The Mojin Warriors are willing to fight for their lives in the sacred duel. In addition to highlighting bravery and glory, they are also striving for more rewards. The deserts with poor resources are hard to nourish to everyone, and they want to make themselves better. The competition is everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the attitude of the Witch Alliance to treat rewards is quite different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the evening, the castle hall will always be bustling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a surplus in the pockets. Their greatest pleasure is to take out the banknotes, exchange a variety of foods in the kitchen, and then share them with everyone. In particular, Andrea, not only rewards the most, but also organizes banquets. This trend can even be said to be driven by her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that these beautiful pieces of paper seem to contain a magical magic, and they are completely stress-free, and Luojia only converts afterwards. It’s amazing to find that the expenses of everyone in the evening add up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this kind of activity can’t stop...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf girl still feels for the first time With such intimate contact between her peers - after she decided to join the Witch Alliance, she quickly gained recognition and acceptance from everyone, and this trust even made her somewhat flattered. Although the witches born in the Mojinsha people are called goddesses, they are respected by most of the people, but there are few deep-intercourse between goddess. After all, they are the blade of the various races to compete for status. Not to mention eating and drinking together, even when they meet, they will raise 12 points of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, although everyone has a lot of money, it’s still quite difficult to enjoy a chaotic drink, so Andrea has come up with several Guessing the game, winning the drink, losing the white wine, not allowing the ability to use it, and holding the stone to participate -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she becomes like this It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is your luck so bad? Luo Jia will not admit it, so it is all the fault of the great chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for him to make such a banknote reward, but to distribute the Golden Dragon as before, she wouldn’t believe that everyone would use it so generously! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you can't go on like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf girl patted her cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't forget that you are here to temper the warrior's way, and then indulge yourself, the skill will be ruined! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has never seen those goddess of witches celebrate like this, whenever they are so solemn and calm, this is the time An outstanding warrior tempered! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia took a deep breath, put on the sweater and turned over to get out of bed, and planned to go to the third side of the city after washing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone here is very skilled. Since they are not allowed to leave the city alone, it is also a good choice to find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After joining the Witch Alliance, she also moved to the Witch Building in the Castle District to live with Shelen, but the latter usually only sleeps when necessary, so most of the time she is alone in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is this something for her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia curiously pulled out the paper and found that it was a letter, uncovering the seal, and it was a familiar handwriting of his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My daughter, how are you doing in Wintertown? No one bullying you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;There is no tedious beginning and wording of the North Korean document, the writing is still very scribbled, but in an instant, let her smell a hint of desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but shake her tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although at the time of separation, Luo Jia has made up her mind and does not think she needs family care. When she sees this sentence, she still feels it. A warmth from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is it possible, when are you a three-year-old?" she muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, I want to come to this sentence and ask again, because you are Luojia. Burning fire, the three princesses of the mad flame clan, only you bully others, no one else bullies Yours, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clan members have now moved from Tiesha City to Bishui Port and have a good land close to the river beach. Although I don't know how big The chieftain is waiting for you, but at least here, he has no words. The promises on the sacred duel are basically in the process of implementation. If you only want to find a job, you will not be afraid of hungry, so more and more tribes will be moved. The resources have caused a lot of contradictions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But those Northers and the Clear Water Queen are different. They are strictly forbidden to fight privately and resolutely use the North Law to solve problems. The efficiency is low, but at least we don't have to worry about being used as a consumable. There are quite a few sand people who recognize this, so the order is not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In addition to rebuilding the clear water port, the tribes also opened up a lot of farmland in the suburbs outside the city. The wheat from the river. There are several groups of people who have taught us how to dig trenches, fertilize, and harvest. It must be said that it is too easy for the people of the North to fill their stomachs. The food we have worked hard to collect from the oasis. They can easily grow out, and they are many times more than us. Now everyone is almost like the Northers. I am not saying that this is not good, but I don’t have to hunt those sly prey, temper my will and strength. I always feel that something is missing... my daughter, do you have any good ideas?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These questions you should ask the big brother is," Luo Jia Yu mouth, then look down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you're done here, you should talk to you. If...I mean, if the Grand Chief is waiting for you, you are good. It’s better to find an opportunity to show him the meaning of service. I heard that there are so many aristocrats in the North, maybe he is the kind..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf girl suddenly turned A white eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, put your paws up, I just talked about it. Compared to this, I want to know more about how well your skills are." Have you encountered such a terrible enemy? You should have grown much better than when you left, but remember, don’t be impatient and blind at all times, never forget the way you are looking for. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this paragraph, Luo Jia only felt that his cheeks were hot, and he almost wanted to bury his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil did encounter it, and there was a big fight with them, but her role was basically zero. Originally thought that the front line was the earliest contact with the enemy, the result did not expect the other party to be able to approach the position within three hundred meters, in addition to being ruined by an odd stone pillar, she did not even see the enemy's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew that it was like this, she wouldn’t choose to stay on the front line - it’s a good time to have a fight at the rear of the artillery camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the special firearms that the Grand Chief created for her are also very uncomfortable to use, and the power is amazing, but she always feels that this is not her personal Power, there is no way to control as much as you like, nor to grow with tempering, it is difficult to associate it with a martial art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
