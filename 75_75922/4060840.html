			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the exercise, Felice came to the lord's castle again with the help of Ai Gesha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the office, Roland Wimbledon’s look is still the same as the previous one, and it does not reveal any smug feelings. It seems that this is only a trivial Small things are average. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this meeting, she felt that the weight of the mortal sitting behind the mahogany was obviously a lot more heavy, and the title in the mouth was not consciously used. "Oh, my Majesty, before I contact the Taqila witch, I want to ask you a few questions first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say," Roland nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have a defensive weapon that can be mass produced?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are looking for the day The plan of the selector is unfavorable, and the war with the devil will undoubtedly last for many years. If such a weapon really needs nearly 10,000 mortals to make it, and the output will not go up, no winter city will still face a hard battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, they can also gain more status for the Tacula survivors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the one-hundred-hundred god-defense army controlled by the witch is definitely a force that cannot be underestimated. When the fortress is too late, it can solve the siege that comes from all directions. When they are beasts, they have to rely on them to kill a bloody way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a smile on the side. "First of all, I have to point out that the fortress is not a defensive weapon. Although it looks very heavy, it is difficult to carry it by manpower or livestock. But for some vehicles, it's not a tricky problem. In fact, with a little improvement, it can be turned into a weapon with both offense and defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Loading...?" Felice repeated. Before coming to the castle, she listened to Ai Gesha. When talking to her majesty, she often came up with some swearing words. Most of them are straightforward. If they don’t understand, they can come up directly. Generally, the other party will always Very happy to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Roland slammed the handcuffs. "Everything that can carry it in action, such as the simplest... three-masted sailing ship, can be regarded as a Vehicles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But such a large ship can only sail in the whirlpool."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’m just an example. In the future, there will be vehicles that can travel freely on land. No Winter City is already working on this kind of thing, although it’s probably just a sideline job with a fortress gun.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A war equipment that can come and go on the road and carry such heavy objects? But listening to the king’s statement is not like preparing for the artillery. Just as she still wanted to ask a few more words, Roland had already said, "As for the production problem, after the popularity of a new generation of processing tools, I believe it will cover the entire border wall within a year or two."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer made Felice secretly breathe a sigh of relief, covering the walls in a year or two? Even if it is a trebuchet and a mattress, it is impossible to create so many shelves in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, it would be difficult for Tacila to survive the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a mixed answer, perhaps their status will be lower than other witch organizations, but ... it is always good to pay less casualties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in view of previous experience, she decided not to raise doubts, but changed the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, Your Majesty. The second problem is that I noticed in the artillery drill that the momentum of the last explosion was not caused by a fortress. Is it the strongest killing method you have at the moment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this question was asked, Felice noticed a strange look on Roland’s face. Smile, "If you want to master the technology, it can only be regarded as the lowest level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Minimum... file?" She was surprised, “Can you create a more explosive explosion than it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The explosion is never ending,” Roland shook his head, “second. It is the level of weapons that the winter city actually possesses. If it goes up, it is the third class... At that level, it is not impossible to level a city in one breath."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
