			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto Passy was awakened by a noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his heavy eyelids and looked around—the candle on the candlestick had already seen the bottom, and the thin flames made the room look very dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white scorpion and the night cannot be seen in the dungeon, and the candle became his only measure of time. At about every three hours, they will be replaced once, at the same time, and the plate in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that was at the very beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, whether it’s candles or food, the time it’s been sent is getting more and more procrastinating. Sometimes he even wakes up and finds that the prison is still dark. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long has he been locked up here? Otto shook his forehead and wanted to make himself more awake. The long-lost incarceration made him feel guilty, especially after he woke up in the darkness of his fingers, which made him feel a sense of helplessness that was forgotten by all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he must live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the father...and even the fate of the entire family, are in the hands of Anpein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto propped up the weak body, turned to get out of bed, and slowly walked to the railing - in addition to replenishing plates and jugs, he also hoped that the guards could Give him a scraper. The unshaved beard has been covered with cheeks for a long time. Every time you eat, it will leave grease and residue on it. Over time, it will naturally give off an unpleasant smell, like a moldy orange peel. If the other party is not worried, it is okay to give them to shave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, he is also a nobleman, and the request for grooming should not be rejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Otto heard the conversation from outside the iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of ghosts are those people doing? The ones that are closed are the eldest sons of Parsi!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; From the volume point of view, the speaker does not mean to whisper, it seems that it does not care to be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Catch and ridicule, isn't the clown doing this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s crazy. If these Acrobatic groups dare to offend the count’s son, they will become fish food at the bottom of the river the next day. They are just a group of unrepresented vagrants!”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also know that it is normal, the eldest son will be locked in the dungeon? Now, what do you like to watch is what the guys are doing, and if there is no inspiration from the Lord of the Morning, I don’t think they Dare to do this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you will guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I just said anything, you love it or not. If you can't believe it, how can you change the big man in the prison for a dinner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, forget it... just a few mouthfuls of spit, eating and not dead." With this sentence, a series of keys colliding with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, if this is what you want to see, you are not asking for fun. Go ahead, I am still waiting to collect the dishes." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron gate made a sour rubbing sound, and the head held a plate of food and came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, adult, are you awake?" Seeing Otto leaning against the railing, the other person looked a little surprised, but the face was very quick. I was covered up. "Exactly, I have eaten today's dinner. I will change the candle tomorrow, and the head of the house will forget to send the new one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otto did not answer - there was a great sorrow in his heart, and even the request to shave was forgotten. Although he only has a few words, he has been able to draw the truth of the previous noise from the conversation between the two. The clown of the Acrobatic Troupe met the giver and then vomited a few mouthfuls of water into his food with the meaning of pleasing Anpein Moya? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prisoner didn't care about his answer. After changing the plate, he quickly left the cell. Although the furnishings and decoration in the room were as refined as the duke's house, the dull feeling of depression made any A person is not willing to stay here more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the footsteps went away, silence enveloped Otto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such an instant, he couldn’t help but want to yell out, want to grieve the other’s dereliction of duty, and want to anger the neglect of Ampein... ...but he didn't do it in the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that makes no sense - the former will only make the next change of time later, and the latter may be in the middle of the "old friend". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the dinner that was used to humiliate him, he didn’t want to touch it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto can’t help but wonder if everything he’s doing is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was preparing to go back to bed, he suddenly shuddered and trembled - in the lingering light of his eyes, the porridge in the plate did not know when it turned into A bowl of black water! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest son of Parsi blinked his eyes and slowly moved to the front of the plate, carefully holding the porridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not his illusion, nor the shadow of the faint fire, but the porridge noodles were indeed made black, like a thick ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, there was an electric light in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acrobatic Troupe, Clown, Juggling... Is it all that is arranged by that person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jorda said that you were an ordinary acrobat, really fake? How did you get to know Roland?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A coincidence. As for why you are looking at me, probably my acrobatic performance is not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey? Can you demonstrate it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, just come to the simplest squid and squirt."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto stared at the porridge for a moment, and suddenly put his finger into the bowl! After a little while groping, there was a slight rough touch on the fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...how is this done? Why does the water suddenly change color?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Not finished yet, look at this tulle, is there anything left? Now I put it in the water to soak it, then dry it with fire, guess what will happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is wrong...oh, wait, is that...word?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can distinguish and write What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me, this is - your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, Hill Fox, this is my name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto gently pinches the rough piece and slowly raises it Congee noodles - it looks almost transparent, even if it is directly immersed in the porridge, it is difficult to distinguish. Only when you rub your hands, can you feel the existence of this tulle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held his breath and walked quickly to the candlestick and unfolded it a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint black waters began to fade, and the candlelights were already shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry up... hurry up... hurry up... hurry up, he cried anxiously, the shadow of the swaying seemed to come from all directions, and his hands The one that holds is the only light in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment the word mark appeared, the candle went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness swallowed up the entire dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
