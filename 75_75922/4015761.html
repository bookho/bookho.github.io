			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the carriage drove into the Glow City, the sounds around it were noisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About can't help but open the curtain, the probe looks out - I saw all kinds of shops on both sides of the road, some at the door Set up a pergola, put a few tables and chairs for people to rest, and some directly spread the goods on the ground, and they stood on the street and shouted loudly, the whole long street is no different from the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time he thought he would come to the Eagle City, the town that evolved from the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;噢, no, the Eagle City has been burnt into the white ground by the Queen of the Water, and the tall buildings in the distance reflect the city’s The scale is quite extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, what is your first feeling for the morning king?" There was a lazy woman behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not the capital of merchants, even the main roads of the city can let the vendors openly sell them, put them in the gray fort, and have already searched the patrols," Joel sighed, "I am afraid that only the fjord can compare with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fjord?" The woman dismissed, "a group of goods that are dumping goods." It’s nothing more than transporting goods from all over the country to scarce places, selling them back and forth to earn the difference, and the goods that can be shot on the island are pitiful. If you want to go, only salted fish can sell some money.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the most powerful thing about the trader is you," Joel smiled and retracted his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't care," she smiled and reached over his shoulder. "My ambassador."<br /><br />&nbsp The other party is an aristocratic businessman who met in the border city of the morning kingdom. Unlike the gray castle, the merchant’s wealth can even be used as a knight in the morning, most nobles will do business, and the status of the merchant Comparable to the nobles. At the same time, the morning kingdom is still a big country, not only rich in agricultural products, but also textile raw materials and finished products are exported to the three countries. Before the departure, Joel had a good complement to the history and customs of a neighboring country. Appropriate stupidity can win the woman's satisfaction, but the ignorant idiot is no one likes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the businesswoman is Denise Payton, although there are thirty-six six, the skin is still well maintained, smooth and flexible. . The light brown hair was on the top of the head, and one of them was deliberately dyed purple. It looked quite weird at first sight, but it was unexpectedly good after getting used to it. As a long-distance, unattended aristocratic woman, she is naturally interested in finding fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took only two days for Joel to talk to her, and then she won her favor with a bottle of perfume. The two were completely glued together, not only did they go with each other, but Dennis also pulled him into his own luxury carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I don't know what is the most popular business in Glow City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Why, do you want to get involved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being old friends...no, trusted by the respected King Wimbledon, I might stay here For a while, ten years, or twenty years," Joel said easily. "Since it is a city of merchants, I can't be excused from it, just like the words you said -"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good aristocrats are good businessmen," Dennis picked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, good aristocrats are good businessmen," Joshua smiled. "In the Grey Fort, the ambassador can be equivalent to the count, not how to do business." "You can afford this title."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say it is," she said in the ear of Joel. "The things that are sold well in the king are divided into two categories. One is a practical product that is used most of the time, and certainly not too common, such as crystal glass, silver mirror, perfume, high-quality fabrics and fabrics. The other is novelty, there is no standard price for this kind of thing. All the buyers like it or not. Every weekend, similar trade shows will be held in the city. According to different grades, the requirements for entry are different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It sounds interesting!" About his eyes lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really interesting. I don’t know if there is such a thing in the world. If you are interested, I can take you to visit the top. The show. However, there has been a recent business over the first two," Dennis paused for a moment and then lifted his appetite and said, "The slave trade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
