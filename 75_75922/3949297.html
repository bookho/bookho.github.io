			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gradual clearing of the woodland on the southern bank of the Chishui River, the days of ploughing are getting closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to facilitate people to and from the banks of the Chishui River, Roland ordered a pontoon on the nearly 100-meter river. The lower part is dozens of rafts built by carpenters, connected by thick hemp rope. He also specifically explained the carpenter, the ends of the scorpion should be rounded, so that the resistance to water impact will be smaller. The two ends of the hemp rope are wound around the four round wooden piles that are driven into the shore, so that the position of the raft is as fixed as possible. Four long planks are laid in the middle of each raft to fill the bridge deck, and after about two meters, they can be used by four people side by side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raft pontoon is very simple to set up, and its service life is not low. As long as the river does not rise or collapse, the rope is broken, and it can be guaranteed for two or three years. The woods of the forests are excellent. For example, the trestles and pavements of the town pier are made of giant wood in the forest, and their lifespan is almost the same as that of the town. Despite the creaking on it, there are still no signs of collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the pontoon to the west, the first piece of land that was opened was the experimental field of the leaves. Nowadays, the surrounding area has been tightly fenced, and there are soldiers of the First Army at the entrance. In addition to eating, class, and sleeping these days, the leaves are soaked in the test field for the rest of the day. From the window of the third-floor office, Roland can vaguely look at the scene in the wooden fence - the wheat there is growing wildly, and the green wheat in the morning, it has become a golden ocean in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold No.1, which relies on magical growth, accumulates seeds almost at a speed of one day. If it is seen by outsiders, it may mean to kneel down and shout miracles. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the land, population, and seeds are all ready, Roland decided to make up the last ring: the regulator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recruited Barack, the assistant minister who was too busy recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your apprentice should be able to be alone," Roland asked. "I need to form two new departments in the City Hall."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, this is not enough." Barov is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you were the first to agree, and then slowly discuss the details, but now it is learned to complain first. Roland’s heart groaned, but the surface was indifferent. “How could it not be enough? Didn’t I just give you a group of knights?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s first round of screening screened out five More than a dozen knights who meet the requirements and can read and write. The teacher couldn't have so many people, so Yuzhong chose the best, and finally picked out nine knights as junior teachers, and the rest were assigned to the city hall, starting from the apprenticeship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Highness, those who are both dragged and lazy, are slow to respond, can copy a few copies of the information, and are unqualified as apprentices." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to discipline them is your business," Roland knocked on the table. "If you don't obey, you can directly distribute the North Slope mine. But these two I must build the department."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Your Highness, you have the final say." Barov reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland said: "The first is the Ministry of Agriculture, which is responsible for regulating the cultivation and production of crops in the territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Barofu stunned, apparently the first time I heard that the city hall should be managed in a row. "His Royal Highness, this kind of thing is not tossed by the serfs themselves. How do they know how to collect them?" We only need to receive the full tax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you...no, I mean the crops in the past will be so low." Roland I took the cup and drank it to cover up my own mistakes. "A responsible city hall should be managed by the people who eat and drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eating and drinking Lazar... Are you kidding?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not, the importance of eating and drinking is not to say, the rice can not let the people eat is municipal The dereliction of duty in the hall is also my dereliction of duty. As for the second half, is the public toilet project not built for this purpose?" He put away a relaxed tone. I really said to Barov, "I don't know how the city hall of Wangdu works. Perhaps the life and death of civilians is irrelevant to them, but in Bianbu Town, I want to build a versatile political institution. The conditions of the territory and the people must be well known, so that the support of the people can be fully and fully implemented, and the decrees issued can be effectively implemented. I now say the composition of the department and the tasks that need to be undertaken, you remember. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
