			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I feel that I can’t really destroy God and feel lost...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland I know that it is better to comfort her or to turn my eyes. The first reaction of normal people to this kind of thing is basically to be lucky. In the face of the battle that may be lost at any time, Fiji is cold because he can’t participate, he has to say The idea of ​​genius is always different from ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top management of the association quickly reached a consensus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war of the gods and the intelligence of the two worlds were classified as top secrets - before the erosion crisis was resolved, the conversation at the meeting was forbidden to be disclosed to the public. So as not to cause unnecessary panic. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the definition of Roland’s origin and identity, further discussion is needed. If it is based on the Fiji language, his importance is even above the president of the association. This is not the only thing that Prism City can do. It must be notified to Yunxiao City and other associations to negotiate. This process is estimated to take a considerable amount of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in order not to delay the enemy against erosion, Prism City will give Roland all the convenience and support within its ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the keynote has been set, the specific support content is discussed after the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this part he just needs to wait for the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hefei and Han went out of the conference hall, and Roland accidentally discovered that Wakiris was waiting for him outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the two for a moment, and her eyes finally stayed on Roland. "I want to talk to you alone."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finanese language smiled slightly and took the initiative to say, "Then I will take a step first, and the cleansing still sleeps in the ward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the martial arts family left, Roland followed Wakiris into the courtyard behind the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is winter, the yard is still green, and there are still some snow in the grass on both sides of the stone road, and the pointed green grass Looking out from it, it seems to remind people that the cold winter is coming to an end, and the new year is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s a stroll, it’s a nice place, but the purpose of Wakiri’s ribbon is not to look at the scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to say?" Roland broke the silence. "I found myself wrong, decided to believe me?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I still can't believe you." Wakiris shook his head. "The outcome of the war of the gods is related to the future of the community. I will never make a decision without verification." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also saw that God is preventing me from exploring the truth - does this not mean that our direction is correct? Even if I can forge the West Line These can't be arranged by me deliberately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, I admit it," Wajilis calmly replied, "but My thoughts won't change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stopped in an annoyed way. "You are helping the gods destroy their civilization."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The accusation of establishing information inequality is meaningless. In any case, the dream world and reality are always separated by a conscious world. Wakiris turned around. "Change to you, can you make up your mind to cooperate with the enemy who has fought for nearly a thousand years? What I can get is just a verbal commitment."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland opened his mouth, but he never said a "yes". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally sighed. "In this case, then we have nothing to talk about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I will never make a decision without verification, but --" Wakiris has paused. "If I can verify the facts, I will reconsider your proposal."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the Fiji language is cold, is the woman who came by the car an extraordinary witch?" she said slowly. "And she is not the same as the witches who are by your side. This difference does not mean ability, but Refers to the style of acting - the former makes me feel strange, the latter is quite familiar. In the words of this world, it is almost the meaning of the brand of the times. If you want to think about it, I can only find it familiar, only the first time and the first After the second man’s battle for the gods, I have never been in contact with you since then. Can you speculate that this witch is not old enough and is still alive?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The age is not big... It should be compared to the devil who has been moving for hundreds of years. With just a few faces, can you infer that books and gods are not the same age? Roland replied in disapproval. "Does this have anything to do with what you said? Even if you ask her for the same answer, I will only think she and I pass through."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, there is a relationship. The life of the Witch of the Federation is only a hundred years old. From the second battle of the gods, it must be based on the technology of underground civilization. I have been pondering them since I was ambushed by traps. Why can I enter the dream, the only possible answer is only the remains of underground civilization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris walked to a artificial waterscape with thin ice, Looking at himself reflected in the water, "Although the conditions of use are extremely harsh, the strange use of the magical power of this ethnic group can really reduce the difficulty of connecting the ideology, and the association that once occupied the fertile plains excavated to the underground civilization is not unexpected. I thought they gave up the real body and turned the soul into the realm of dreams forever. But when I saw the witch, I realized that I was afraid of guessing the wrong direction."<br /><br / >&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can let a living extraordinary person freely enter and exit the world of dreams without any external force, this is not something that the magical technology of underground civilization can do." She said by herself, "I don't Know what method you are using, but at least be able to confirm that if the existing witch can use this method to enter the dream, then the high-ranking promoters of my family should be equally effective!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you plan to be--" Roland jumped in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the Lord of Heaven come to see me." Wakiris looked up. "Even if you are the creator of the dream world, it is impossible to reproduce one." A character you don't know at all. Heckzod, as the commander of the Western Front, will undoubtedly verify all the problems I want to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland blinked, I couldn’t help but laugh. "That is a demon monarch. If I can refer to it, do I need the first army to fight in the wolves? Moreover, before it was ambushed by humans, now I don’t even dare to show up. Where can I go to find it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help you create this opportunity," she said word by word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Roland frowned. "Are you serious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But you have to promise me two conditions. First, you should not use this opportunity to attack Heckzod. Second, no matter what decision I made, you must let it go."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever thought about how much risk is there for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are all taking risks!" Wakiris sighed. "Yes, you think this may expose the secrets of human inheritance, but I am not? Let a young man be in danger. If you turn your back on promises, I can What should I do? Don't think that I made this decision very easily!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably aware that her emotions were slightly excited, she calmed down a bit," In short, this is the biggest concession I can make. As for whether or not to take risks, the decision is up to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stared at her for a long time before asking, I want to know, what made you change your original idea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Afraid of a terrible future and giving up is just a trick, even if we In the end, it will fail, and that is why it has done its best." Wakiris snorted softly. "A human being can say such things, it really makes me feel a little surprised. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the speech of Fiji in the meeting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was at the time... Outside the hall?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
