			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't move." There was a voice from Elena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two brushes were brushed and a stone needle was cut off. The numbness gradually subsided and replaced by deep pain in the bone marrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia clenched her teeth and didn’t let herself scream. She looked up and saw that the place where the people stood before had been filled with the long needles of the spider magic. If there was no god punishment, she was afraid that she had been nailed to the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even with a superb skill, it’s extremely difficult to completely avoid such a wide range of blows - being held by Elena While jumping out, a stone needle slanted from her outer thigh and penetrated her legs and knees. After the stone needle was broken, the rolled flesh and bones were faintly visible, and the blood was soaked in the trousers, and the wound appeared to be bloody and fuzzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alena is not much better, her abdomen is pierced by a stone needle, and it is blocked by a half-needle, so that the internal organs do not flow out. Fortunately, the body of God's penalty army does not feel pain, which makes her spirit still maintain a high concentration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few seconds, Andrea felt that her forehead was covered with cold sweat, and she struggled to find the special pain of the leaves from her arms. The pill was stuffed into the mouth, and the bitter and awkward taste brought her some distracting consciousness back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes have already handed over to the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others rely on the protection of the devil's witch to temporarily escape the catastrophe. But everyone is quite embarrassed, and he has added a lot of new injuries to his body. If he shoots again, I am afraid that the result will be fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are new footsteps in the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously Erskuk’s long-awaited trap could not have only two spiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the god of punishment for the witch was restricted by the injured, and could not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is extremely detrimental to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia grabbed Elena’s hand and said in a hoarse throat, “Let everyone gather and retreat to the west, and it’s too late to come!” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Westward?" Elena groaned. "The first army's front exit should be in the south..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The road has been gone, the return of the original road will only be surrounded by the devil layer, the hidden forest in the west is the only way out -" I am afraid that in addition to the ambush in the underground passage, There is a full amount of red fog tanks. If you are surrounded by enemies without worries, you can imagine the next game. Although it will be farther and farther away from the west, it will also lengthen the enemy's attack distance, provided that they can support that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now think about it, the previous waits of the demon are not all because their reinforcements have not arrived, but the manpower they have set up also takes time to meet. The many channels that the other side digs should be spread throughout the rear areas - only then can the enemy be able to approach the ambush no matter where they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the signal of the devil's action is probably the moment when the "stand-in" flies out of Taqila. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Elena nodded and began to exchange her companions to concentrate on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bombardment of the shotgun, Erskuk always walked in the outer area, and the violent winds that were picked up by the magic consumed the physical strength of the people. Despite the multiple blue light on the barrier, there is no sign of injury - apparently scattered stray bullets can hardly damage it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone gets together, the figure of the madman also appears in the woods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Attention to the spear!" The ashes shouted and raised the giant sword to smash the bone spear that was shot at the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer's witch raised a single grenade to fight back, and the scene was chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had to listen to the seal from the ashes and shouted at the lightning. "Go find the two spiders and kill them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But - —”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Only you and McMug can do this – go, that’s the biggest help for us!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spider's launch once is about half an hour's time. Now it's been three minutes. If you can't destroy your opponent before the next shot, they can avoid the stone needle after dragging the broken body. The possibility of rain is minimal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By the way, Tilly left here!" Ashes snorted without saying back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Lightning hesitated for a few seconds before he gnashed his teeth. "I know - you must hold on!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course." Andrea Philip smiled. "Now is not giving up..." she shouted at the god witch, "Give me a weapon!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you do it?" frowning her face with her, "If you don't hurry me, you will be shackled."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, one hand is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the bolt from the godly witch The rifle, biting the bolt with his teeth, slammed back, pushed the bullet into the barrel, and then placed it on Elena’s shoulder with one hand—even if she lost her legs, the magic was exhausted. The stinging of the wound and the over-consumption of dizziness are afflicting her. She is still a shooter who is envious of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian ash is still fighting blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could she give up first? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning... What should we do?" Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t panic, calm down first," Lightning looked at the dozens of madmen rushing in the jungle and the blasting columns that swelled from time to time, forcing themselves to concentrate. Get up. She knows that Andrea is right, the only advantage of her own is speed. Once the demon person has broken the ability, it is difficult to fly again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more such a situation, the more you need to be calm! Judging the situation and taking the most correct response is what the explorer should do! In the case of impossible to escape with them, the elimination of the spider demon will undoubtedly help even greater. And to get rid of the monsters wrapped in stones, you must have a newly developed grenade launcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You find out where the spider magic is. I will first contact the Seagull, and there is a weapon we need under His Royal Highness!" Lightning quickly cleared the way. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle!" Mai Mai turned into a gray-tailed goshawk and flew high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She raised the speed to the limit, and in the blink of an eye came to the glider hovering around the outer ring of the sniper point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about their people? How is the situation now?" Wendy asked worriedly as he opened the hatch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no time to explain, I need spare weapons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning into the cabin, Putting the launcher and grenade strap behind him, at this moment, Tilly opened the door. "The situation is very bad, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl hesitated Then, I finally nodded. "Well, Ashes will let you leave this place as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, I will leave."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning and Wendy can't help but see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I am here, it will only burden her, and it will not help." Tilly’s tone was slightly trembled and seemed to be trying. Repressing what, "intellect tells me that returning to the camp immediately is the most reasonable choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
