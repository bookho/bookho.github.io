			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty, Book and Speer sit in the lobby of the first floor of the castle and share the topping black tea from the Glow City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the squeaky kettle from the hook of the fireplace, pour the boiled well water into the cup and watch the surface of the water gradually become transparent orange red The mellow aroma came from the white mist, and Wendy felt that she was lazy. Blowing away the heat along the cup, she gently licked the small mouth, after a slight bitterness, it was the sweetness that echoed between the lips and tongue, and the warmth poured into the belly, which made her unable to help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the hall, the white paper is still in sync with the gods. She has mastered the technique of injecting magic into the seal, and can control the magic more accurately. Output, but no matter how toss, it can only light the first magic stone on the seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I saw her, I couldn’t help but think of the days of the Communist Youth League," the book said with a sigh. "At that time, I was afraid that no one would have thought of it. "Let's live like this now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can predict in advance, Hakala will not go it alone." Wendy put down the cup, "Well, wake up later." The sisters no longer have to experience the suffering we suffered," she said with a smile. "Probably, we are the last witches who have suffered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" is also the oldest group, and the time to enjoy a good day is also the shortest," the book roll, "sounds like it seems to have suffered a big loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"So you came back so early today, just want to take the opportunity to enjoy more leisure time?" Wendy joked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just left the official business at hand," the latter shrugged. "Roland is not there, and there are fewer things to do." Some are not used to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Wendy raised her eyebrows. "When I come back, I will be able to say these words without fail." I will tell him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... I will not be able to guarantee that every question will be understood until the next exam." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your feelings are really good," Speer said with a smile. "I am not young, but I don't feel so deeply... In the witch, it should be considered a lucky one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, not every witch has a high-powered father," the book is drinking Tea, "and will pass on everything to your daughter - such a person is a minority even in the nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, City Hall Feeling like "Wenty looked at her. "I heard that you have been running there when you have time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Benefits," Speer grew out. To breathe, "I first saw such a well-organized and closely related departmental management approach. Compared with letting several ministers take charge of the matter, the City Hall itself can take care of employee compensation to avoid substitution difficulties and ability. The civilians joined in without any hindrance... I really don’t know how His Highness thought of this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“She also talked with Barov very much. "The book is covering up." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, but he asked me a few questions about the aristocratic law, which I just know better," Speer shook his head. "And The new law enacted by His Royal Highness is very unique. It may be implemented in the Dragon Ridge in the future. I can’t help but discuss it with him for a while.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is it unique?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, on the definition of the people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "When Wendy's sister, when can I light up the second magic stone," I don't know when the white paper came together, holding the gods and swearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you grow up," she reached out to the little girl, "Come, let me hug."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White paper climbed her hand, hands and feet and climbed into her arms with the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy touched the head of the white paper and looked at the two people who were discussing the new law, they felt calm inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
