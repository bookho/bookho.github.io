			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty...陛下?" The sound of the nightingale will wake Roland from the gods Come over, "The general manager is still waiting for your reply."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, I know all of this," Roland blinked and converges. Return the report in hand to Barov, "just do what you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Barov raised his chest, leaving I also solemnly added a sentence, "Please take care of your body, kneel down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the general manager leaves the office, Roland asks the night owl, "Why, my face looks "Is it bad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it looks okay," the latter deliberately looked at him for a while before saying, "I have been in a daze lately, not Is it related to the erosion of the dream world?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head, “Those changes in the dream can’t affect anything, but the individual things are a bit strange to recall. Nothing to worry about "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" is not it ...... so like "The Nightingale curl one's lip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fourth day of his dreams. Although Falun successfully positioned the headquarters of the association, Ling could not sneak into it - according to her It is said that there has never been a place like the area. It is clearly built in the ground beneath the fingers, but there is no shadow to hide. The head was full of bright "light belts", she waited for several hours in the same place, has not seen it extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath was also quite frustrated to apply for punishment from Roland, who naturally did not hesitate to veto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next play plan was implemented very smoothly, and then Roland did not stop carrying the new Takira witch into the dream, but what I saw at the headquarters that day. I heard it, but it was always in his heart like a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole incident from the top to the bottom, revealed the same can not be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the conclusion about the membrane world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always believed that the dream world will present a modern and full of natural forces in order to integrate the memory of him and the radiance and maintain internal self-consistency. society. In other words, no matter how many incredible phenomena are there, they are rules that are determined by self-consistency. These rules are mostly taken from his consciousness, which he understands and is easy to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the words of the chief disciple 完全 completely exceeded his knowledge reserve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing Roland knows is that membrane theory is developed from superstring theory, and that's it. These two theories are extraordinarily mysterious. He has not done any in-depth reading. Unlike quantum mechanics, he has read through one or two popular science books. In the dream world, they should be concealed as invisible content, just like books that have only a cover and are all blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whether it’s awkward explanations or the derivation formulas and proofs shown on the hall screen, it seems to be the same – he’s the first time In the dream, I see things that I can't understand at all. This feeling is like a high school student dreaming of the culmination of physics. It is absurd and incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This even made him feel that today’s dream world has become completely different from the world that first entered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems as if something is growing wildly where he can't see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another weird thing is the chief disciple himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Garcia reminded, Roland found that the vision, hearing and reaction of the martial artist are better than ordinary people. If you talk to him on the stage, it is not just around. The keeper, even the new people in the front row of the hall, should be able to hear one or two. But the fact is that no one at that time turned their eyes to the two of them, clearly not a whisper attached to the ear, but did not attract any attention. At that time, he was not in the heart, but then he remembered that a newcomer who was taken care of by the chief disciple alone might not attract everyone's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
