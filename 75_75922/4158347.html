			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermes, the old holy city area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien’s feelings for more than a month can be described by big ups and downs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the Lord’s Lord took him to the god of God, he has made up his mind, and he must hold this thigh anyway. Never let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which firearms, what iron birds, are not worth mentioning in front of a city that can fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the miracle that makes people pay homage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he also swept away the previous trend, showing his value as much as possible, and spared no effort in organizing the work of the people and building the supply station. He has also won many awards from the Lord of Scorpio. This made his position in many aristocrats more stable, and he felt the first impression of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a letter from the North broke the stable life of Ma Weien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t expect that the Lord of Scorpio would attach great importance to this seemingly absurd piece of paper, and the first thing that disappeared after a few weeks was to let They immediately went to the foothills of Hermes and the Winter Kingdom, waiting for new similar letters - as to who the sender is, how long it will take, and even at which specific location to receive the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Ma Weien is not willing to leave the god of God, and even if it is a devil everywhere, it will not deprive him of his status. The devil with power. Only the command of the Maharaja is difficult to violate. He finally chose the former in the two places, not for anything else, only because the old holy city is closer to the god of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the northern borders of the four kingdoms have been covered by red fog. The Grey Fortress seems to be struggling to resist the devil. He fell below and fell into the Duke. There are not many people who have many people, and some nobles follow. However, it is a bit anxious to wait for a secret letter that I don’t know when it will be sent. In order to complete the task as soon as possible, Ma Weien has risked the risk of the people fleeing and expanded their activity area. During this period, there were several private escapes. He also hanged a lot of people to warning the police. At the same time, he made a big reward for the possible clues, but he could not wait for the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all of these are luck issues, then the development of things will be completely beyond Marvin’s expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of God suddenly rises, then goes all the way to the east, and finally disappears into his vision - this makes the Duke feel a great panic, originally floating The city of miracles behind him is his greatest reliance, and the days without it can be described as a difficult time to sleep. To make matters worse, the Lord of Scorpio has never appeared again, as if he had completely forgotten the secret letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, he heard the news that the floating land was hit by the Grey Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Ma Weien didn’t believe this kind of ghost in his heart--it’s a floating mountain with dozens of miles, and the gray castle people have to flatten the mountain. Ability, which will be used until now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately not everyone is as smart as he is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment when people floated, he found that he could not control other nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no news on the Lord of Heaven, which exacerbates this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mood is getting worse and worse, except for alcohol and women, almost nothing to do, the days are almost back to the past in the winter The same as Wang Du Shi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sack, Sack!" When a bottle of wine was finished, Ma Weien shouted the name of the old butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, what do you have to order?" The butler quickly opened his door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's find a few girls in the evening, be young and beautiful-" he shouted with a big tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, you ordered them yesterday..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was yesterday's business I am the Duke, this is my power, understand? They should give everything for me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right, the people who sent out... Is there any news?" Ma Weien does not believe in the nonsense in the streets, does not mean that he will not verify - in fact, the god of God left Herme When he was in the plateau, he sent several teams to track the target, trying to figure out where it was going. It’s just that the efficiency of these people’s work is really outrageous. I haven’t come back until yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler shook his head. "At present, I only know that there is no battle with God-made gods along the way. Maybe two days later, there will be exact news." "Come on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of lazy idiots..." Ma Weien opened a bottle of new wine. "Okay, go on."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then wait another two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red fog is dissipating, and it is not guaranteed when the Grey Fortress will make a comeback. He must also consider the way for himself - even if he is not here, It does not mean that the command of the Lord of Scorpio is violated. Whoever gets the letter is not taking it, but at most it is less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the Wing Dong Kingdom is not the place he wants to go. It has been proven that it is impossible to resist the attack of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien heard from other high-level devils that a new god of God is flying here, and it is also the city where the king of the devil is. The retreat is obviously more suitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you follow the route of the previous part of the devil's transfer, it should not be difficult to find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, he will only leave with the most loyal aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is coming soon, but the girl that Ma Weien wants has not appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him anger and burned, it seems that his old butler has begun to use it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a wait for half an hour, when the footsteps came from outside the door, the words of scolding had already flown into the eyes of Ma Weien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is not the old butler who opened the door, but a group of dirty people. Some of them hold the hoes, some hold the poles, and they look exactly like a bunch of people. The duke did not dare to watch them pouring into the house, and the mud carpet on the bedroom was muddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that his house was trampled by such a bunch of cockroaches, he could not help but scream, "Guards, guards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Ma Weien did not get a response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a bloody head that interrupted him, the old butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mavien’s drink instantly woke up halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has been fed up with your oppression, Ma Weien "Pike!" shouted the leader. "For your damn command, many people are alive and dead in the quarry. You don't even care, even the money you have given is deducted! We are not your servants. , not your slave!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nobility is no better than the civilians, the Grey Fortress is right!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Working hard for monsters during the day, and sending your wife and daughter at night, you are the real devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now Let's go to the Grey Fort, or you don't want to get out of this room!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, Ma Weien hates to think that these guys have been eroded by the minds of the Grey Fortress - As early as this is the case, he should not let them go to the place outside the old holy city to inquire about the news! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the Duke, who do you dare to do?" He screamed and pulled out the sword at the table. Compared to the "weapons" in the other hand, this sharp blade looks sharp and unmatched. Since they can come here without warning, it is obvious that both the guards and the servants have betrayed him. He must take out this place, contact other nobles, and then concentrate the knight to destroy this mob! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
