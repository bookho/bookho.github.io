			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later, the letter was smashed several times and finally arrived at the headquarters of Cangshan Command. After Hill Fawkes unpacked and viewed it, it was classified as "the most critical information" and was handed over to Itis in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browse through the information, Beidi Pearl's brow is close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people are there on Dagong Island now?" she asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff officer suddenly looked at each other. The first one to answer her was dawn dawn. "Adult, the first army is currently stationed on the island with more than 300 people, the engineering team. About 2,500 or so, there are almost the same number of islanders. If you want to know more specific personnel, I will adjust the information -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “No,” Itis interrupted. “Go and ask the iron axe and other officers. Our plan must be adjusted immediately! Fast!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Adjustment means..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether it is a soldier or an engineering team, whether it is a gray castle, a morning sun or a wolf heart, you must evacuate Dagong Island as soon as possible!" "She looked very dignified. "There is already a desperate island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden disappointment, but the surprise was surprised, the long-term training of professionalism still allowed They immediately executed the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the chicken and dog jumped in the office, Itis looked at a piece of paper in the palm of her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was sent with the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the count, she clenched her fist and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first high-ranking officers of the First Army gathered together and took turns reading the information sent from Yongdong Xueyingbao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hekel Zod, the Lord of the Scorpio..." Brian’s look is no better, "If the content of the letter is correct, this damn ability It’s amazing, it’s a few kilometers long, and it can be used many times. I said that in just a few days, the whole winter will be completely disintegrated, even a city that resists the end.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning and McMug have encountered a high-level devil in the Great Rift Valley, and its ability to come and go has been regarded as an object that needs to be focused on, now I realized that the other party is probably the Lord of Scorpio mentioned by Erskuk, and this is far from the limit of its power - not just itself, but even the troops can carry out large-scale transfer through the door, such a powerful ability. It can be called a strategic level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participants can't help but have a deeper understanding of the word The Devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The withdrawal of Dagong Island has become a matter of no doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, it’s easy to go to the island to get out of the island. If the Strait’s natural danger can’t stop the enemy’s actions, it will become a prisoner of imprisonment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, they must race against time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the clues provided by the letter and the summary of the staff, the devil may have gathered a large number of troops on the front line. The offense is likely to start at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe decisively issued an order, "Stop all the fortifications on the island of Dagong, and immediately transfer the people on the island! Not only the seaboats that are rented, I want Seeing all the things that can float on the sea are involved in this evacuation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following," the audience sing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone’s death, Ai Gesha said with anxiety, “Why is such a powerful devil not showing up in the second battle of gods? "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think there are three reasons," Isis’s voice is still calm. "One is that Hecksod was not promoted to The Maharaja does not have the ability today; the second is that they think that human beings are not worth mentioning, the Tianhai world is the most important thing; as for the three..." She deliberately paused. "Perhaps the devil’s high-level thinks it is not suitable. Fighting humans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
