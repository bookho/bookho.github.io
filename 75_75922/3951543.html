			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, the nightingale felt the whole black and white world tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the fog, the sights in front of them all recovered. The black curtain of Shenshi dissipated, and the heart that was about to jump out of the chest retreated. The man who fell on the ground was not Roland, but a guard who had never seen him. He wore a costume of the honeysuckle family and a dark red coat on his chest. , like a wound that was shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you?" The familiar voice rang on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head, the speaker was Roland, he was surrounded by several guards in the corner of the hall, so that when he rushed into the room, he did not notice he. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Zhang opened his mouth and found that his throat was so hoarse, his hands and feet were cold and numb, like the rest of his life, his body was so soft. At this time, the only thing she wants to do is to hug Roland tightly, but she knows that she can't do this. There are other nobles here. If they want to take up the security bureau independently and shoulder the shield of the territory, they can't be in the crowd. He was too close to him in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he clearly told himself that he could not, but the body could not help but walked toward Roland, opened the fog, crossed the guard, and hugged him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene suddenly sounded a scream, obviously everyone did not understand why a witch suddenly appeared, half a sentence did not say and disappear again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fog, her arms cling to the back of the prince, her head buried in her chest, listening to the heartbeat of the other person, as if only in this way Proving everything is nothing but a false alarm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland seems to be aware of what, clap his hands to the nobility. "Everyone goes to the dining room for lunch, don't leave the castle for the time being, and the afternoon meeting continues!" <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the scene left only the prince’s guards, Pedro, Sylvie, and lightning, he asked, “Is the murderer involved in this assassination? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale gradually calmed down, and she reluctantly withdrew from the three steps, showing her body shape and pretending to be close to the prince." It was, when I found out that the instructor behind the criminal was a honeysuckle guard, I immediately rushed over.” She told her discovery and Mans’s confession, “I didn’t expect the other’s real purpose to be us. Take the lead and find the opportunity to start... Fortunately, you are safe and sound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can plan this step and consider the timing and witches of my visit. Inside," Roland sighed. "This person is really wasted as an assassin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;Pyro immediately yelled at the prince with one knee. "His Highness, I really don't know if he is-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it, this You have already said it, and I don't like to impose crimes," he interrupted. "But you are also wrong. There are flaws in the use of the castle and the peripheral guards. This is your dereliction of duty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Peero opened his mouth and finally bowed his head. "I am guilty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take him The identity and the history are clear, I have to know the result now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After the eldest son of honeysuckle left, the nightingale asked the worry of his heart. "What is the situation at the time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no danger," Roland laughs Laughing, "Thanks to Hilli's warning... But then, he chose to start in the conference hall, he is already at a disadvantage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the prince Narrative, she only After the assassination of white - but in fact, I did not like what he says is so easy. Although he was not allowed to carry weapons in the hall, the enemy hid a short beak in the clothes, and he was indeed a castle guard, so no one performed a search and placed him directly into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to say that the assassin has made any mistakes, that is, carrying the stone of divine punishment. The guards of the peripheral patrols were very normal in wearing the stone, but they were particularly conspicuous in the hall. In order not to interfere with the observations of Hilli, all the nobles took off the stone ornaments as required. The sudden black void made Sylvie the first. Time noticed him, and when he came down to the prince, Sylvie immediately issued a warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
