			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the Cavaliers leading the way, Roland returned to the table. "Can you treat small animals, why do you think witches are evil?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The teacher said that the witch can do things that ordinary people can't do, sometimes it doesn't look bad, but that is the devil set up to seduce more people. The trap..." The girl’s voice went down. "I, I have never seen the devil, I swear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have never seen it, but that It is the church's lies, and your teacher is also one of the deceived," Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Church deceiving?" Nanawa opened her mouth, "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Shaking his head, no explanation. Even if he said it, they could not understand. When civilization has not yet developed to a certain extent, this wonderful thing will always happen. Even without the promotion of interests, people will automatically attribute natural disasters, man-made disasters, or incomprehensible phenomena to the behind-the-scenes black-handedness. In history, most of this pot is backed by women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this world, the witch has the tangible power of unknown origin, it is easier to become the target of the church. If you think about it, you know that the church can never let this vision go. If you want to seal all the witches as saints, call this a gift of God; if you want to kill the witches, call them the spokesperson of the devil. However, once the former is chosen, the majesty of monotheism will be greatly jeopardized – because the emergence of witches has nothing to do with the church. If the church that believes in other gods also seals the witch as a saint, everyone is a chosen person, then who is the only true God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premise that polytheism can coexist is that the gods exist and can restrain each other. Since God does not exist, it is a symbol of fiction by mouth gun. Why let the other party share the world? Therefore, any monotheism will claim that it believes in the true God. For the infidels, there is only one way to go, that is, the physical body is eliminated. Similarly, they can only choose the latter and spare no effort to fight the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has nothing to do with it, just for the benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a live chicken in the castle kitchen, and when the knight is carrying its wings, it is still tumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing made Nana Was stunned. Roland took out the silver knife from the waist and let the Cavaliers grab the chicken and smashed it toward the chicken. After the end, I asked Nana to come up to heal it. After the cure, I will continue to change the way... so repeatedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the chicken that had been tossed for a long time was finally screaming, Roland had a general understanding of Nana's ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can restore damaged parts, including splits, fractures, bruises. If the part is completely missing, for example, after cutting the chicken claw, she cannot make it grow new claws. However, if the broken jaw is attached and then the ability is applied, the fracture can be completed as before. In the end, she couldn't reverse her life and death. Once the chicken died, her treatment would be ineffective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not see the "sweet water" she described throughout the treatment, she simply put her hand on the chicken's wound, the wound can Restore at a speed visible to the naked eye. After a series of experiments, Nana's physical energy consumption is not large, at least not as sweaty as Anna trained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only dissatisfaction is Nana Wah himself, she felt that the chicken was too much, so that at the end of the trial, she kept licking Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, don't worry, come and eat something," Roland saw that he had to use the "Summon Afternoon Tea" to divert her attention. This trick against Anna has been tried and tested. He believes that few girls of this age can resist the temptation of delicious desserts. And it turns out that Nana Va is not much better than the former in the face of fine pastries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eating the pastry, Roland sent people away from Nana. Anna asked inexplicably. "Why don't you leave her? She is like a witch, is she?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She still has family, and she The family did not currently find that she was a witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny whispered, "It’s just a matter of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sooner or later," Roland sighed. "So it’s a little late. You...want your father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
