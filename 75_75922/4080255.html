			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers also reacted at this moment, in the absence of time to transfer another machine gun muzzle, they directly removed the back of the wheel rifle fire shot - <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword that was inserted into the monster became the best marker. Within ten steps, the revolver was almost impossible to miss. The officers and men, including Brian, fired all the bullets in one breath, and the intensive barrage swept over the head of Isis. She could even hear the snoring of the warhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going back, the distorted air becomes solidified, and a monster emerges from the void. It stands nearly six feet when standing, and is half as tall as an adult. In addition to having a pair of sharp forelimbs, the abdomen is still seven or eight pairs of side feet, covered with taupe carapace, which looks like The creeps are stunned. Fortunately, the armor was not able to withstand the close shot of the gun - it was like a locust-like slender head was collapsed with a fist-sized gap, twitching twice and then fell to the ground with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost let it go!" There was a sudden screaming behind Istis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An epee came to the fore, and the strength of the power was loud and screaming, and the sword was straight ahead of the position of the first machine gun squad. The other two monsters flew out and the invisible ripples dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then several sorcerers crossed the side of her body, lifting the sword and splitting the monsters that had not yet had time to climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reinforcements are here," and Isis, who realized this, was relieved a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of enemies is not many, there is no invisible advantage, and the extraordinary warrior who was quickly rushed up has been cut down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she noticed that when the monster approaches the god of punishment, it will present a strange form - such as half hiding in nothingness, half being forced The original shape, the ability to hide the whereabouts, has failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you alright?" Maggie helped Itis. "We saw these enemies in the rock wall, but it was a pity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Using colorful magic stones?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," another name The tall man walked up to her. "Give it to us here. The mortal weapons are not good at dealing with this situation. You should inform the people above, and then bring some gods to the witch."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis remembered that her name seemed to be Betty. "Can you destroy the other person's disguise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A technique similar to the stone of God's punishment," the man shrugged. "At the moment, it can only make the enemy's invisibility short-lived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But they also took the stone of God's punishment, but why can't they see the enemy..." Brian looked at the bodies of the three soldiers on the ground and asked with a grin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not surprising," Betty replied calmly. "Light, distance, and attention all affect the observations, the general quality of the gods, the scope of influence. Just one or two steps or so, the enemy's exposure time is only in the blink of an eye. In such a dim environment, it is normal to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isis can't help Sighed, indeed, I just noticed that the half-body shape of the scythe monster is mostly at the time of the two sides, plus the length of the enemy's forelimbs and the advantage of sneak attack. It is too late for ordinary people to find out that it is not right. Unless the god stone is buried in advance, there is no way for the first army to take such an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Brian slammed his fist. "I should send the barbed wire first!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I go back, I always feel that something may have happened in the hole," Betty urged again. "It’s just like that, it’s like screaming the whole snowy mountain."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You heard it?" Itis asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We lost most of our sense of touch, so our vision and hearing became extraordinarily sharp..." The other person looked at her and opened her eyes. "I didn't expect Mortal people can do this too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people stationed on the Blackrock Pagoda obviously do not know the battles that took place at the bottom of the hole. They are still using the ropes to lower the combat supplies such as tents, stone, guns and ammunition. After Brian stopped the crowd, he did not transfer to the steam lift to return to the hole, but let Maggie move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as everyone was about to arrive at the worm channel, the intensive gunshots suddenly sounded on the top of the head, and the intensity was like a storm! This means that the first army in the checkpoint has not left, but directly into the state of full firepower! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of a group of people can not help but change, the witch is even more cheeky cheeks, so that the rate of rise is a little faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the magical ark rushed out of the ground, Isis couldn’t help but widen her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the top of the cave, there are constantly dead limbs falling, like a corpse rain, three machine guns are lined up in a row. Under the command of Ervi, he shot at the top of the black lacquered hole; while the revolver gun and the precision shooting team dealt specifically with the dead ends of the head, without aiming at the enemy, only by erecting the barrel and firing along the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the enemy?" Brian grabbed a soldier and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a wicked beast, an adult!" The soldiers were busy filling the ammunition and reported that "a group of evil beasts have come down from the snowy mountains!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell! How could they suddenly come together at this time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isis’s heart flashed A thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the dull cicada used to summon the same kind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has read on the books written by her Majesty, there is a strange kind of voice in the world that is hard to hear, but for some creatures. It is particularly clear that even some of the species can make unique exchanges with their peers by making such sounds. Is this what they are now experiencing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there was more than one unexpected news. Just as Brian watched the battle, another soldier ran into the cave. "Adult, Miss Mai It is found that the evil beasts east of the fascinating forest have signs of abnormal activity - they seem to be moving closer to the snow-capped mountains instead of attacking the winter city as expected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What? This -" The gunman squatted in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult?" The soldier eagerly asked, "What should we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" How could this be... how could this be..." Brian squinted at his face, whispering a word in his mouth, and sweat had already appeared on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is still too inexperienced, and Isis frowned. As a conductor, she could not express her confusion and incomprehension at any time. Especially before the ministry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She coughed twice. "The matter is not complicated. First of all, we must gather the first army stationed outside the snowy mountains and concentrate on the hole defense. Reducing the length of the front line, only a few machine guns can stop the impact of the evil beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian looked at her, and it took a while to return to God. "Say... is also true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Secondly, let Miss Mai, immediately contact Roland, ask him to send reinforcements, just in case - after all Our ammunition and food need to be replenished by the Chishui River. Once we give up the camp and stick to the channel, we will not be able to fight for a long time." Itis quickly and without chaos, "The other evil beasts have no ability to transfer, and several cement vessels outside do not want to." Abandoned, leaving ten people to both contain evil beasts and guide the followers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evil beast at the top of the cave is responsible for Miss Sylvie. Guide the fire to block, the problem is not big; as for the distribution of the god stone can be temporarily not worn on the body, and Buried around the checkpoint to prevent sneak attacks. Finally, don't forget to send the Takira witch to the bottom of the hole. Betty is still waiting for our reinforcements. Only when they are enough, can they go to the south end of the river and find Miss Ai Gesha. Waiting for someone." Her voice was calm and steady, and the people around her gradually calmed down. "The faster this step, the better. If I didn't guess wrong, the place where the strange sound came is the key to solving the problem." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
