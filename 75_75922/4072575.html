			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, she saw a lot of frowning people carrying bags back and forth, apparently feeling sorry and sad about leaving the stone fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once slipped to the third place, not only the assigned Shibao room is much smaller, but some people can no longer live in it, and must move to the outer street camp. Although it still belongs to the scope of Tiesha City, life is obviously not as convenient as the core area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, a few limited territories around oasis and lakes were occupied by the big clan's stone fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia recorded the look of these people in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came to the door of the palace where my father was staying, the guards saw her suddenly showing the uncontrollable joy. "Princess, your injury... really good." "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s as good as before," Luo Jia smiled. "Is the father in the room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The patriarch is always there, just..." The guards hesitated. "There are other people inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't ask who those people are, she has already guessed one or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the door panel, the disputes inside are clearly distinguishable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isn’t it a good three days? Why didn’t you leave the main fortune today?” Someone said loudly, “It’s hard that you want to violate the three.” God's vows?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Attention to your attitude, Kabcha!" It seems that her brother, Rohan, "has you annexed the Blackwater clan It is time for them to let the land out, so we can move in. Now there is a mourning cloth in the stone fort, you let us move in now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can send people to tear yourself, patriarchs only want to see the results, do not want to hear your explanation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You-!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, since you admit defeat in the sacred duel, don't put on the look of the previous arrogance. Your patriarch has not spoken yet, you If you count something, go to the side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are right, if you disagree, we can play another game!" Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“噌——”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sound of a sword coming out of the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards also pulled out their weapons and wanted to go in and help out, but they were stopped by Luo Jia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." The guard squirmed his lower lip. Finally, she bowed her head in front of her unquestionable eyes, and the second half of the sentence swallowed back. "I understand, adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia pushes the door , sinking into the house. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The several warriors of the Nutao clan stood up with their arms and fearlessly, not paying attention to the sharp edge of the neck and neck, and apparently determined that the flames would not dare to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fact is the same, whether it is the brother-in-law Luo Han or the father’s bodyguard, they only dare to put the weapon on the other side, but they dare not squat. As a result, the mad flames fell on the momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulz. Burning fire is sitting behind a square table, the fire reflected in the eyes is cloudy and uncertain, and the atmosphere is very quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All put things together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice broke this nervous A sigh of breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulz immediately smiled. "You finally woke up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three Sister, you... this... no, I mean... great!” Luo Khan’s eyes widened and she looked at her step by step to the crowd, and it seemed incoherent, from his I can’t see an accident or a surprise on my expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the big brothers were so surprised, not to mention the warriors of the angry Tao clan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lo, Loja? You are not... have you been hit hard in the sacred duel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is impossible! I obviously saw her being dragged down the high platform, her legs have been crushed into a mud!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that... ...wolf's ears and tail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a monster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not doing Step by step to the raging warrior, and the latter obviously lost the previous calm, "No matter what, the mad flame has already confessed to the anger on the burning platform, this is the result of the testimony of the Three Gods! Even if you want to challenge again , you have to wait until six months!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid deliberate admittance and protect the strength, the surrender will not be challenged to the winner within six months, this is All the rules approved by the sand people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will abide by this result, just as we believe in the Three Gods." Luo Jia’s reply made the warriors a little relieved, but they have not waited for them. Relaxed completely, and the latter half made the atmosphere tense again. "So... who is Kabbah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am!" Take a step forward with a hard scalp. "Why, since you follow the result of the duel, you should move out early. You are no longer the head of the clan. Do you still want to continue to occupy this stone fort?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An answer to him is a straight punch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Kabcha is also a dueling player, there is still no resistance in the face of the ever-increasing wolf claws. The whole person was beaten up and down, directly breaking the door panel of the palace, and fell to the outside like a piece of rag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You--" Others glared at them, but none of them dared to rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if the mad flame falls to the third clan, the majesty of the patriarch is not something you can violate, let alone the clan in the clan, who allows you to be so arrogant?" "Luo Jia shouted. "This punch is just a lesson. Let me get out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation reversed from the moment she stepped into the house. - The previous provocation of Nu Tao was based on the strength of the annexation of Blackwater. Whether it is a sacred duel or a private contest, it is better to win over the mad flame. But when the mad flame three princesses appeared in front of them as they were, this grasp no longer exists. Even if the other party can't launch a sacred duel within half a year, it is a giant desert wolf that attacks the harassment of the angry Tao clan from time to time, and the losses caused by them will be difficult for them to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, they are offended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sand people, revenge is equally sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry warriors left Kabuch with blood on their face and left without even saying a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Father, since the three sisters are safe and sound, can we return to this stone fort after six months?" Rohan clenched his fists excitedly Dao, "Or you can talk to the ragout of the anger, maybe even the move is saved - anyway, there is no chance to win, he should sell you this person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Other bodyguards are also excited. "Yes, the prince is right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will let everyone stop." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, don't forget to drive out the angry Tao clan who stayed in the stone fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "And what they bring, let them move together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulz. Burning and coughing twice, looking at his daughter, "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The room was quiet a lot, everyone was waiting for the answer from the three princesses, Luo Han’s face biting his lips, and his eyes showed a faint color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
