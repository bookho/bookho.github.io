			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Book" quickly swept the entire test paper, and then wrote the total score of the three subjects at the beginning of the volume: 17 points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a full percentage difference from the final result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey... It seems that the problem lies with McMug?" Nanawa snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, is the result just like this?" Mystery is greatly disappointing. "Isn’t it the book that deliberately covers the wheat, using the high-scoring conditions for honey sauce. ——哎哟!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lily slaps on the back of her head, “You shut me up!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to continue watching?" Axia asked, "We will leave here early, if it is discovered, it will be bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute," the candle sighed. "Maybe something went wrong when you transcribed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I have Know the results, this will do..." Evelyn shook her head. If it is the original writing method, it is possible to mix the numbers in a compact arrangement. However, in the popular education implemented by Roland, the numbers are replaced with simple and easy-to-remember single-character glyphs, so the chances of admitting mistakes are too embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think it is McMug who flies in from the window and stops the meat - stop!" Mystery month grabbed his head. "Don't do it, I don't say it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw that the "book" checked all the papers and began to transcribe the scores until all the results were concentrated on one form, the score of the wheat column Still seventeen points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that it is not a question of the teacher of the book," the candlelight took a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we go?" Axia anxiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evelyn is preparing for the next, "Book" suddenly stood up and looked in the direction of the door. The six immediately followed her gaze, only to notice when the door was opened, and a town hall apprentice appeared in front of the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they talking about?" Mystery asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusion has no sound, so you can only judge the conversation between the two by mouth type. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be the book's adult...Lord Barov...Is there something for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the "book" nodded and left the office with the apprentice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when the door was closed, perhaps because of the airflow, the house suddenly rolled up a cold wind and blew all the papers. Get up, messy scattered on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...the window." Lily muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evelyn also saw that the previously closed window was now opened with a slit. It can only be said that the book does not close the window, and the window is opened by the airflow generated by the opening and closing of the door. With the sudden autumn winds, the window swayed back and forth, the bigger and bigger, not long after, it was a strong wind to bring it back to the window frame, although I could not hear the sound, but the tremor from the glass The degree can be seen that the impact is not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jaw-dropping scene happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The airflow swept through the office again, the pen holder was scraped on the table, the quill pen slammed into the ink bottle mouth, and suddenly flew up, the landing position was exactly that one Grade sheet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of the quill pen is the first to land, and the plaid filled with the score of the wheat stubble is wiped unbiased, leaving a short vertical, the original ten Seven points became a one-hundred seventeen-digit three-digit number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably someone heard the loud noise from the office, the door was pushed away again, and the apprentice who left the notice book first looked at the probe, then Surprised to walk in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went to the window and pulled all the windows back, then squatted down and picked up the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the case? Evelyn is opposite to the candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is neither a book transcription error nor a scam, but an accidental wind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evelyn has been able to guess what happened next, and the book received an order to make a long song, and handed the transcript to Wendy. Wendy is not a reviewer. Even if she is confused about the results of Mai Hao, she will not question the judgment of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, in the mystery of the moon, the truth is finally discovered," the mystery moon looked up, "the culprit is... the book teacher!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the wind!" Lily gnashed her teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if the book is closed, the wind will not blow the papers, isn't it a blow?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is this for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, right," Nanawa muttered. "If so," It should be the fault of His Royal Highness Roland. It was he who built the new town hall here, not only expanded a circle, but also covered two layers. Without this extra second layer, the book roll could not be judged here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...you also make sense, so the culprit is - Roland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You are enough!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me... Can I end?" Axia looked like she was crying out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, it’s ok," Evelyn patted her on the shoulder. "Thank you, let's go."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, let's go? Maybe we can find the next quiz in the office of the book?" The mystery month is in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the real purpose of your coming here!" Lily rushed up. "I won't let you mess!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I am just talking about it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final investigation ended in a farce, and after the farewell to the candle, Evelyn returned to the Witch Building alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the truth is falling, her mood is not calm at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, the flying paper and the falling quill are constantly appearing in her mind – the trajectory of the two is irregular, but at the last moment, Formed a clever and perfect result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only paper and pen, the airflow driven by the door leaf, the time when the apprentice enters and exits, the components of this result, without any condition, can not achieve the score change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these conditions are unconscious and confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the same is true for bartending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding various ingredients to the wine, you will not feel each taste in turn, they will blend and influence each other in the wine, each one can be The tastes that people accept require countless attempts, and sometimes a combination of accidents creates a unique taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evelyn can’t help but think of the microscopic balls that Roland said – they’re always doing disorderly disturbances, and each one looks like nothing. Relevant, on the whole, can show wonderful traits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She closes her eyes and feels something in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is full of chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the results are hidden in chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like being destined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
