			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermes Cathedral, Tongtian Tower Chamber of Secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefron looked at the opposite witch and could not help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there really no time for Master Mayn?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," the witch screamed捋 捋 own golden curly hair, "otherwise he will not send me to participate in the meeting, first introduce myself, my name is Isabella, the pure person of His Majesty the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tefren, this..." Two other new bishops, Soli Dar, from the trial army, met the arbitral tribe, who knew that the church had a group of secret witches, but I did not expect the other party to participate in such a high-level meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is the direct subordinate of the Pope, and her position is the same as that of the bishop, but she does not take the actual position in the church," Tefron reluctantly explained. "In addition, The bishop can also have his own pureness, and by the end of this year's demon moon, you can pick a few witches to train."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original, the original is In this way, "Soli has widened his eyes. "So... what kind of abilities do they have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the highest secret, only the Pope Know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do we do to train the witch," El looks quite dissatisfied. "If the following believers know it, the church's reputation may be uncertain." Will be seriously affected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is to help you complete some unsuccessful tasks," Isabella picked up her eyebrows, "except this You can also sleep with you, vent your anger, or play with something else... know that the witch’s taste is not A woman can compare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ridiculous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, enough, "Tefron coughed twice. "I am an adult, I said that the Pope's pureness is equal to the bishop. When acting as an agent, you can even regard yourself as your own. You should know the most basic courtesy. And Isabella. Please also don't open this kind of joke. They are not like the old man who has stepped into the coffin, and the blood will be taken seriously."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "As you wish, adult," Isabella smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," El gave a nasal tone and ignored the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then let's talk about business right now," Tefron touched his beard. "Do you have anything to report?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't understand why Mae's Majesty suddenly asked the church organizations to send the captured witches back to the Holy City, even if they were to convert God's fines, the price we paid was not small." She took the lead in opening the road, probably the anger of the pure person. Her tone was quite blunt. "Since this order was issued, we have captured three witches, but on the way of secret escorting, one person escaped from the cage and killed. All the escorts have died, so far we have not found her whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without wearing an "iron collar"? "Soli asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all churches are equipped with the highest level of magical punishment," El did not breathe. "For this witch, we Sixteen believers were lost, four of whom were preparing trial warriors. This kind of thing will come several times, I am afraid that everyone will be afraid of catching the witch. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, we all know that fighting witches are only a very small part, and most of the fallen people have no resistance, so this kind of thing is not too common. . "Isabella said in a relaxed tone," and every time you bring back a wild witch, it is possible to add two god warriors to the church. Which one is more important, should I not repeat it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with Isabella's statement," Soli nodded. "The pressure on the Hermes defense is increasing day by day. We need more gods." The penalty force is to fight against the evil beast. The role of a god penalty force on the battlefield is enough to top three or four trial warriors, not to mention the reserve army. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the Pope has made a decision, we will do it with our heart," Teflon turned to Soli Dar. "How about the defense?" ? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
