			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailboat from the Long Song Fortress is slowly docked at the pier in Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the springboard was put down, the people on board carried a variety of bags and walked off the trestle. Most of them are setting foot on this strange land for the first time, and their expressions are a bit stunned, and the urging of sailors behind them exacerbates their sense of uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the crowd, a middle-aged woman slipped her feet indefinitely, her body lost balance, and she was about to fall off the trestle. Another woman took the lead and grabbed the other's wrist to help her stabilize her figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you...thank you," the rescued man slammed his chest and thanked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman just smiled and waved her hand and gestured for a small matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling Sirte, who was waiting at the dock, recognized the young woman from the crowd at a glance - the flower of tomorrow in the fortress theater Irene, his beloved wife. She was dressed in a white dress with long hair on her head and still looked so beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first knight endured the excitement, and when she stepped on the land from the pier, she stepped forward and forced her from the side, completely Ignore the eyes and opinions of the people around me. The other party was shocked and recognized that the person was a gentleman and responded softly to his hug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was terrified when I heard the news of the defeat of the Dukes. When I was in the long song fortress, I wanted to see you, but unfortunately there was no chance." She said in the ear of the knight, "Fortunately, you are safe and sound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was locked in the dungeon of the Lord's Castle, the guard is impossible to let you Going in," film released his wife. "Are you still having a good time in more than half a month?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." She was silent for a moment, "I left The theater is over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill immediately understood the meaning of his wife’s words. When he was the first Cavaliers in the West, only the Duke dared to move her hands, now he It became the prisoner of His Royal Highness, and the group of Irene’s guys no longer had to hide their own malice, and they were ready to wait for an opportunity. At this time, going to the theater to work, no doubt is to send the sheep into the tiger's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, I have a job here, and the salary is not low." He comforted, "Go home and talk again."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Home?" Irene looked a little surprised. "Do we not have to live separately?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, Most of the prisoners who did not execute and did not accept redemption were used for hard work. The places where they lived were basically tents and barracks. Many people were crowded into a pile, lying on the ground covered with wheat straw. The treatment of the families of the captives is not so good. The women have special camps, and they have to sleep on the ground. When the men work, they have to be responsible for cleaning up the man’s residence and cooking water for washing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the film was moved. At the fortress farm, she had at least one spacious room with comfortable beds and soft bedding. For her own sake, she still chooses to go alone to Bianbu Town. Even if she wants to be forced into a small house or tent with other women and accepts forced labor every day, she has not retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am a teacher now," he took Iline’s bag, took her hand, and walked toward the new civilization, “and the teacher can get A set of free housing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, when he first listened to his teacher’s treatment, he didn’t expect too much – as a prisoner, there was a room that was not bad. It is. Even if it is a wooden house that is leaking through the wind and rain, you should be able to live by tinkering. The result was that he was unexpected, and the housing assigned to the teacher would be so... formal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the community, the street suddenly became spacious, the ground was covered with gray-white gravel, pressed by the rolling stone, and it would not be a bit Feel lame. At first, Fei Lin did not understand this practice and felt that the stonemasons were wasting manpower and time. It was not until a heavy rain that the rainwater flowed into the ground along the gap of the stone and then merged into the deep drainage ditch on both sides, and he understood the reason. Compared with the long songs in the long song fortress, it is full of water and alleys. This street is obviously much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene looked around and asked some questions: "The houses here are all new. Are you on the wrong road?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
