			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She made a long dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless people wearing white coats and masks around her, busy with sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From their stunned and dignified look, it seems to be dealing with a very difficult thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, I was seriously injured before, and I have already fallen into the dying. Is this perhaps the self-comfort of the brain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows how bad her condition is. Under normal circumstances, the medical staff will turn to the head and ask for the next thing without paying attention. Do useless work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she believes that Roland is the one who created the world, she is equally aware that the gods are not omnipotent - otherwise they will not let God find opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she insisted on the end of the other party's request, it is also a matter of conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware that you are dreaming is a wonderful feeling, like being soaked in warm soft light, the pain is all gone. The voices of people talking are like coming from far away, and the picture in front of them is more blurred and drowsy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, the scene and other pieces in memory merge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray sky above the head turned into a white, shadowless lamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor left after they were busy, she "sees" herself being picked up by the medical staff and then sent to a pair of men and women. The two kissed her and showed a happy smile on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she fumbled and grew up a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking lights...She realized that this might be the last flashback of the brain. The strange thing is that the memory fragments that I couldn’t think of before, and only a few extremely vague impressions, are completely reproduced in the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw her childhood home, the backyard full of sheets and... family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where she lived at that time was like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lying in the arms of her family, she closed her eyes with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sleep completely shrouded her, there was a whisper of love on the top of his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said...what is the name of the child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If not, just It’s called Fiji."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Fiji is slow and slow Opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the familiar ward ceiling, her thoughts were blank for a while before I reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, yourself... is this still alive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to feel the whole body, but found that her hands and feet all responded to her will, not only that, there was no lag between consciousness and movement, as if they had never been The same as the injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing the cold and surprisingly raised his right hand to the front - although the entire arm was covered with bandages, but from the outline, it was not as good as it used to be. problem. Before this hand was clearly hit into several breaks, even the bones were broken into the flesh, and it was impossible to restore the original by conventional means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but laugh out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That guy... it’s really done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, he actually vowed to say "because I am a god" - did he not notice that his age is not suitable for such a line? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fijian language turned over and found that a little girl with white hair was on the side of the bed - not someone else, it was another "world creator" in the mouth of God, Jieluo. She put her hands on her head and seemed to be still asleep, but from the slightly melancholy eyebrows of the other side, I was afraid that she was always at the bedside during her coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finanese smiled and sneaked out of bed, took the radish into the bed, and then walked out of the ward with a light hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the corridor rest area, she saw Roland, Vakiris, and many martial arts counterparts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing her appear, there was a commotion in the crowd, and many people came around and asked her about her situation. And she went straight, strode to Roland and grabbed his hand. "Go, it's time to do business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland feels instantly Dozens of scorching eyes cast on himself, "Oh...what is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too much to say that one person is a creation god. Persuasive, but if you add a genius martial artist, the effect may be very different. Isn't this your exchange condition?" She smiled and said, "You have fulfilled the promise, then it is my turn."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you like this?" Roland asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Fiji is still wearing a striped shirt of a hospital patient. The bandage is wrapped around his ankle from the ankle to the neck. Only the head is exposed, and the bag is like a donkey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took Roland and walked toward the corridor. "Of course, this is more convincing, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conference hall of the nursing home, the prism city is sitting around in a circle, and the complex is listening to the report of Fiji. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy at that time and the demon have a distinct difference. It not only has incredible power, but also is hard to be fatally hurt, even if I will be the force of nature. The same is true to the limit. According to it, only the creators and gods of this world can destroy their core."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The facts also prove At this point, I have repeatedly hit its head astrolabe, but the other party is unscathed. If it wasn’t for Roland’s arrival in time, then the matter might not be recovered. The enemy claimed to be Delta, from erosion, the messenger of the gods. It is one of the murderers who destroyed Prism City, so it is entirely inferable that its associates have similar characteristics. There is no doubt that our world is in great danger."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement has made a whistle in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon is not afraid of the martial arts, only the martial arts can kill it. But now suddenly there is a god-in-law, and even if the power of nature is not effective, does it mean that it has no rival at all? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is said by other martial arts, everyone is still skeptical about the ability problem, but it is not questioned by Fiji. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An invincible enemy is just chilling when you think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention "God" has several more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very glad that you are finally fine, and I am glad that Mr. Roland is on the side of the association." After the stone sinks, he first said, "Of, really, collect from the scene." According to the information obtained, the enemy does have power that we cannot understand, and it must be the martial artist who is present. The description of the various parties, we have reason to believe that it is the hunters who defeat the "erobic enemy". Roland. In addition, he can rescue you from unimaginable serious injuries, and there must be extraordinary means, but... By the enemy's words and words, he is considered to be the world creator, will this be a bit... too sloppy? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree. After all, this concept can be big or small. If the world was created by some people, where are these people before it appears? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's too ridiculous, our world should be born from the Big Bang! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
