			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After midnight, a messenger panted into the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind...winned!" He couldn’t care for the drink, shouting hoarsely, "Adult, the Aosha clan won!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a day or so to return to the small oasis from the Burning Place. If you ride on a double ride, you can arrive on the same day, obviously a winner. He returned to the oasis in a non-stop manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire "skull wine glass" suddenly sensational. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, I know they can win!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Process?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly talk, how to win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there still no casualties?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People’s whispering inquiries immediately surrounded the messenger, and the good fruit wine passed through the layers of the crowd and was handed over to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram also feels a loose body, no matter what, the more powerful Aosa, as a member of the clan, his future days will be more comfortable. Although it is not done by one's own ability, but...how, it is not too heavy to take the tribe out of the identity of the deceased and the deceased and move to Tiesha City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clap his hands to the clan, "Take the breath first, then tell everyone about the duel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" The letter used fruit wine to moisten the throat, and took a deep breath and said, "The two sides did not start, the angry Tao clan and the Pride of Aosha reached an agreement and took the initiative to give up the second position! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub was quiet for a little while, then broke out The argument of the argument seems to be overturning the roof! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no duel on both sides?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Proactively let out... Is this surrender? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that saying that Aosha can be the first clan in one step?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Complete four sacred duels in a row, killing one person on the court, this is something that has never happened before!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also heard This news came over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, like me, if not so sensational, who would want to leave the Yinchuan oasis in such a cold winter." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, it really didn't come out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A cup of God for the proud!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"敬卓尔.银月大人!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram also squatted for a while, But he was not surprised by the news that the angry Tao clan had resigned. This is a good understanding. Save the strength temporarily in the third position, wait until the proud and violent winds beat the blood, then look for opportunities to return to the second, and even the head of the clan is not impossible. After all, they can retreat, and the flames are hard to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was shocked by the fact that the discussion in the crowd made him faintly aware of the purpose of the new owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group is quickly accumulating reputation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has never been a sacred duel that can involve so many people’s attention in the eyes of the present--the revenge of Princess Aosha, the continuous challenge like a storm, Regardless of the number of opponents... always with four people, and the legendary calendar that does not kill one person, all of this seems so incredible, but also to the greatest extent people's curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, there are always a handful of people who can stand out from the star-like tribes. A normal power alternation is even less attractive than the news that Aosa is trapped by the iron whip. However, this time, a clan has been exiled, and the clan whose daughter was sold as a slave is still able to usher in an opportunity to turn over. This light makes most weak clan unwittingly stand on the side of Aosha. What happened after that was even more bizarre. In just one month, Aosha became a center of discussion among the many people in the sand from the unknown challengers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burgeoning head of the pub is the best proof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether they are looking forward to or expecting sarcasm, or simply want to see which step Aosha can take, at least Zall Silvermoon has become A household name. It is conceivable that when the last sacred duel comes, how many people will go to the burning place and witness the battle of the summit of Aosha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram naturally understands what this prestige means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last clan leader who spread the name throughout the polar South almost unified the entire desert, although he fell behind in the war with the Grey Fort, but he has vaguely With the posture of the messenger of the three gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the purpose of the new owner also here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference is that this time, Aosha no longer has to be an enemy of the Grey Fortress - the forces behind them are crushing the northern part of the Shamin’s head. kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Roland. Wimbledon will bring oasis and order to the Mojins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Thinking of what the iron axe said, he suddenly realized that when Aosha really became the head of the clan, there might be something earth-shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will probably change the fate of the entire Mokinsha people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Two days later, on the outskirts of the small oasis, the first military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your injury...no problem?" The echo looked worried to the ashes. The battle with the Blackwater clan made her bathe in the blood--although most of the blood was on the opponent's, she was not unscathed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, will not affect the next action." Ashes did not want to unravel the long ponytail, a black hair like a waterfall, with a loose The robe, at this time, can't see that she is a warrior who has lived and died many times, and like a beautiful woman who is graceful and graceful, "the herbs of the leaves are also very effective, and most of the deep wounds have been crusted." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just some skin trauma. The physical quality of the extraordinary witch is better than us. After all, nutrition does not need to supply the brain, the muscles grow very fast, and the skin is also It’s very thick.” Andrea shrugged. “You don’t know what she used to be when she hunted the church. It’s just hiding in a place where even mice don’t want to live, living on corrupt animal bodies, nothing. If you die, let alone the small injury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes rolled their eyes, did not argue with her as usual, but leaned on the lounge chair Close your eyes and raise your spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the practice of a mature warrior. The iron axe on the side thinks that except for eating and fighting, the rest of the time is used to rest and recover as much as possible. Physical strength, to meet the next challenge with a full spirit. Other witches without Winter City may be strong, but there are few who can do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a candidate to wait for the next plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do next?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have done our best according to the instructions given," the Iron Axe recalled the instructions of Roland before the departure, although some words were very gargle, for example Hype is the most important thing, creating topicality as much as possible, creating a duel legend, letting the entire desert hear your voice, etc... but all in all, it is to attract the attention of everyone as much as possible. Nowadays, more and more people come to watch the sacred duel from various Yinchuan oasis, which should be considered as meeting this requirement. "The rest is to defeat the mad flame, and then you will speak the words of your sorrow in the presence of everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
