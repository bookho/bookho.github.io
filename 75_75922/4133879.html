			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She was at that time... did she say that?" Wendy laughed out with a sigh. "Was the child named Snake? Is there any other indication?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just follow her It’s a smirk,” the leaf shook his head. “It’s not easy to just say that it’s courage to say that. Just exhaust your guts just once.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too," Wendy's smile on her face is more prosperous. "Young... It's so good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Say we are so good? Listen to the conversation of the little sisters in the back." The green phantom of the leaves fell from the branches, condensing the cost of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not an eavesdropping, but the completion of the squatting." Wendy said in a proper way, "He asked me to pay attention to the actions of the next two people - - Since you want to pay attention, then conversation is part of it, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it seems that there is nothing wrong with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's more, without my advice, wouldn't you overhear their conversation?" Wendy smiled and looked at the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃-" The latter cleared his throat and raised his mouth. "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two suddenly looked at each other and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves beckoned, and a huge vine was raised from the ground, holding himself and Wendy slowly to the top of the canopy. Then the dense branches spread, staggered, and reunite, forming a terrace made of green leaves underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this point of view, the world is suddenly more open, the jungle that has been spreading to the Longji Mountains is like an emerald tree sea, while the other side is vast and endless. prairie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the co-help, the leaves occasionally set up a similar tree house for the sisters to avoid the heavy rain and muddy ground. Only then, it usually takes a long time to build a place to rest, and in order to save the magic as much as possible, the house can save the province, and the basic shape is like a skeleton. Even so, it is not a space for everyone to have a space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the leafy terrace is not only the same, but also the loungers and coffee tables. There are even two broad-leaf cups on the coffee table, and the light golden flower in it is shining in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this brewed by you?" Wendy picked up the teacup and sniffed it, and a light fragrance was introduced into her nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, using the morning dew, honey and sugar cane, and adding a half-open jasmine bud," the leaves nodded, "although not Chaos drink, but wins how much you want to drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your ability is getting stronger and stronger," Wendy said with emotion, "although they It is said that His Highness Anna is a genius that has never been seen in a hundred years, but I don’t think you are much worse than her. As long as the time is long enough... you may be able to control all the jungles in the world and spread your consciousness to every corner of the continent." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the current speed, I can’t do it," the leaves smiled and waved. "The light is the fusion of this lost forest, and it has to be spent." Ten years, when I can leave here, I estimate that I am old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not necessarily," Wendy licked the cup of tea. “Ai Gesha said that the influence between the witch and the magic is mutual. The stronger the witch, the more often it is accompanied by a stronger body. With a longer lifespan. If it’s not that the war is too cruel, those supernaturals may still be alive now.” She looked up at the sky, “and your magic is even above them, that is, you may be among us. The one who lived the longest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves did not answer, but revealed a lonely look, but Wendy did not notice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, not only these two points, but even the appearance is related to the level of magic." She paused for a moment, "The legendary comet queen Akali They even confessed to Pasha, and they all confessed to Pasha.” Wendy took back her eyes and carefully looked at each other for a moment. “Well – I really feel that you have become a little different from before... How to say, from The moment that fell in the shade of the tree, like the fairy in the forest, is really enviable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
