			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, there is a team stationed in the dock area," said the Lightning sink, which is responsible for monitoring the enemy's situation. "The number is around 100, and it looks like a militia." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only a hundred people?" Roland was surprised. It was not surprising that Tiefco would deploy at the outskirts of the quay. The vast fleet drove all the way through Chishui City and Silver City. It will inevitably be noticed by the people. Although the speed of the steamship is much faster than that of the sailboat, it takes only five days to complete the latter's one-week journey, but it is still not comparable to the continuous messenger, the courier that stays up all night, not to mention the pigeons. The new king's spy sends a message with the pigeon, and Tiefco can get the message about two or three days in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s surprising that the other party only sent a hundred people to defend the dock. According to Roland’s vision, the first battle should be launched near the dock, in order to stop yourself. The troops have landed smoothly, and both sides of the river will be equipped with bow picks and firearms. They may even set up a trebuchet. This is why he built a river gunship before the spring offensive. The efficiency of waterway transportation far exceeds that of land marching, but it also has the disadvantage of limited docking and easy pre-settling. With the ability to attack the land, he can easily defeat the enemy's ambush and open up a safe landing site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other party seems to have given up the "great advantage" of the half-crossing, which is correct from the results, but it can't be justified - Tefco It is impossible to know the range and power of a 152mm gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Roland called Sylvie over. "Is there a violent pill on the militia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilvey summoned the eye of magic to watch it for a while. "I didn't find anything like a ball. Some of them didn't even have the weapons, but...there seems strange in the ground."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They buried something under the ground...there are also on the dock," Hilvey frowned, "It's a crock and a wooden barrel... it's filled with dark gray powder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...gunpowder?" Can't stop coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that this makes sense," Roland said with ease. "The militia team of a hundred people is just a Tefco to attract The real purpose of the bait we pay attention to is to let us seize this rare opportunity to land on the dock, capture the dock, then detonate the gunpowder and send us together with the dock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Although it is easy to say, but he does not think so, this tactic similar to the ancient mine warfare is indeed a good plan, even if you see the clue, you always have to disembark - since the choice of water transport, The terminal is the only way to go, and Tiefco is clearly aware of this. It’s just that he didn’t plan to defend the front, but set up an ambush in the dark to give himself a surprise. If there is no Sylvie, I might have a big loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since it was discovered in advance, it is still very easy to solve. Without wireless detonation technology, Tefco will inevitably arrange ignition personnel in the vicinity of the buried gunpowder barrel, as long as Just fix them in advance. In any case, the terminal must be guaranteed, otherwise artillery and ammunition will be difficult to transport to land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the careful observation of Hillvi, Roland found two suspected fire points, one in a shack at the dockside, with a duct leading to the ground. The nearest gunpowder barrel, the other is in the warehouse of the dock. What the two have in common is that the dark black holes caused by the stone of the gods are moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discussing the results with the iron axe, the operational plan was quickly determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First sneak into the warehouse by the nightingale, quietly killing the ignitor and holding the door to prevent possible substitutes from breaking into the gunpowder. After the destruction of the shack with a gun, it does not matter if the explosives under the ground are detonated in advance - as long as the terminal is safe and sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On the wall of the Wangdu West Wall, the steel heart knight Weimas lifted the lookout and observed the movement on the canal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender canal is like a gleaming gold ribbon, which runs through the brown and white wilderness. The snow has already disappeared, revealing the green of the earth. That is the germination of the grass, and it is also proof of the recovery of all things - such a view is so pleasing to the eye whenever it is appreciated. The only thing that doesn't match is the black smoke flying above the canal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
