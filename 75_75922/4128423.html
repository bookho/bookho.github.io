			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, there is an urgent report from the morning sun!" The guard walked into the office and placed a bag of thick sheepskin bags next to the red wooden table in Roland. "Listen to the messenger, it was Sean who entrusted them to send it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Roland couldn’t help but come down, he put down his biplane design , stood up and said, "Get it open and take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exploration team left almost two months after the winter city, the last time it was received Their message is still crossing the gray castle border. At the moment when the source was not in the country, Roland was quite worried. After all, mining and transporting ore is a long-term process. The first army has limited mobility, and the farther away from its sphere of influence, the harder it is to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to get a reply today, he is very particular about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what makes him secretly is that the package is too big, almost reminding him of the express mail of the next generation. Whether it is found or not found, a letter can clarify the situation. What kind of situation did the exploration team encounter, will Shawn send such a big bag of things back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is all paper inside," probably saw his doubts, and the nightingale said to his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Paper?" Roland turned his head and lowered his voice and asked, "Did your ability have evolved to see through objects?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think so, but unfortunately." The nightingale lazily said, "I just touched the hand into the bag when the other person entered the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that her alertness is really...and so on, Roland suddenly felt a little wrong, Evelyn visited with a new chaotic drink, or the chef pushed When the snack car comes in, will she also "touch" it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the weight of tea in the past afternoon seems to be really less? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, all of them are loaded with paper," the words of the guard interrupted his thoughts. "And most of them are covered with ink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this new reporting method? Roland groaned inward. "Is there a letter that can be read?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please wait..." The guards will have all the things in the sheepskin bag. After the pouring out, there was a new discovery. "The bottom is a letter of sealing wax."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take it over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These blackened papers-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all spread out on the floor," he told Tao, "Shawn can't always spend a lot of effort and send a bunch of useless things back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sat back in the chair and uncovered the envelope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the date, it should be sent a week and a half ago. Like the bag, this letter is also surprisingly long, with a total of ten pages - it is hard to imagine that an exploration result needs to be expressed in such a long story. This may be the reason why the other party used the emergency report method, but did not transfer it to the animal messenger after entering the northern part of the gray fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, Miss Achema has found the source you want - just at the northeast junction of the morning sun and the wolf heart, the locals call it the cage mountain. Place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn’s first sentence made Roland put his heart down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this trip is not without any gains. The mining area is still in the territory of the morning sun, which means that he can control the entire mining process through the Quinn family, even though the cost is A lot more, but it is better than being limited by the wolf heart and the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the other party’s wording is not cumbersome, which makes him more curious about the content behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just that the source is not in the mine, but in a very old ruin. What’s even more incredible is that it is neither underground nor The Takira fugitive has nothing to do. We have suspected that it may be from the hands of the devil under the sea, but the discovery of Miss Witch has rejected this conjecture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
