			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, the candlelight walked into the castle hall early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night falls, the book teacher will open the lecture in the hall, unlike the aristocratic colleges in the big cities. The students who come here are the co-helpers. Witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she was not the first person to reach the classroom, Evelyn had already sat at the long table and waved at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness has recently explained to you what mission?" The candlelight just sat down, Evelyn could not wait to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first came, she still called the other person the Lord. The candlelight sneered in the bottom of my heart. "Yes, he asked me to display some odd-shaped metal enamels to make them cure at room temperature, and I don't know what it is."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... is that the case," she glanced. "His Royal Highness has not yet done anything for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exercise Is there any content?" The candle is strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s all my own practice," Evelyn shook her head. "He only occasionally finds me to taste the newly prepared white wine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just that this is what you want to see in your Highness. You have been at the pub and are very familiar with the taste of various drinks. There are not many witches like this." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tasting wine does not require a witch at all," she protested. "A Golden Dragon is enough to recruit a dedicated winemaker." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." The candle patted the other’s shoulder. "I think His Highness must have his plan."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The book is also so comforting to me, but I don’t even know what this ability can do, and I can’t turn the water into wine out of thin air... Is it the best wine to sell? But the civilians only can drink the inferior ale, and the tastes of the nobles are different.” Evelyn put his chin on the table and said with frustration, “And the wine of His Royal Highness is more The more... it’s hard to drink, I suggested to him to add water or juice to reconcile, but he seems to only want to make the strongest wine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what to say at the moment. At this point, she and Evelyn can be called the same illness. After going to the island, they can only do some chores for most of the time - as the fish oil resources become more and more abundant, the curing of the candles becomes dispensable, and drinking is an act prohibited by the adults of Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the previous life was tense, the materials were often distributed according to their abilities. Sometimes the candlelight can only be assigned to a grilled fish without salt. She didn't think there was any problem with this kind of practice, and she was willing to give more food to the witches who were so expensive. But the group and the vague sense of rejection in the witch made her feel a little uncomfortable. Fortunately, the adults of Tilly have taken care of them, and they apologize for this method of distribution. They promised to make adjustments after the materials were abundant, so that the witches did not show the rejection too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Bianbu Town, this situation has almost never happened - the witches are sitting on the same table, enjoying the meal with the Prince’s Palace, wearing There is no difference between the use and the use... The most important thing is that whether they are powerful or not, they will treat each other as a whole, which can be seen from the daily life. Although she came to Bianbu Town for only two weeks, she has already felt this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They really treat each other as their own sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the candle fire very envious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the witches were sitting around, the book teacher came in with a stack of white papers. "I don’t teach new content today, I will learn from everyone. The knowledge is tested in a comprehensive manner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?" Lightning first hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕咕?" McMug is closely following. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have been studying for three months now, and your Highness thinks it is necessary to test your learning outcomes." The book laughed. "All questions are listed in these." On paper, it is divided into three parts: Wang Guoyu, mathematics and nature. There are a total of 60 questions, correct answers, and wrong points. Of course, if you can't understand the problem, you can't raise your hand. I believe that you have already I have mastered the reading and writing of the text, or I can't answer the answer even if I know the answer." She paused. "By the way, His Highness said that only half of the people who answered more than half of the time can enjoy the ice cream dessert on the weekend afternoon. The score is lower than this limit. Yes, the afternoon tea will be disqualified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
