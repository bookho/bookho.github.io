			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the ridge of the Dragon Ridge, lightning found a leeward, skillfully built a tent that could accommodate four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning bonfire dispelled the cold, and the nightingale rolled up the trousers and exposed the bloody calves, only to see that the position hit by the Holy Ghost had swollen. Before I bite my teeth, I didn't feel anything. Now, when she relaxed, she felt that it was difficult to move her legs. If it wasn't for the timely arrival of Mai, she really didn't know how far she could run with the female Marquis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s extremely dangerous to walk through the fog when you’re inconvenient – ​​the changing lines are both ladders and sharp edges. If you don’t grasp them, they can It's easy to cut yourself into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am here to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 smashed out from the big backpack Stacks of first-aid supplies, in addition to cotton and small bottles of alcohol, as well as leaf-processed herbs, the latter is the most important medical treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the smelly pungent alcohol fell on the wound, even the nightingale couldn’t help but squeak, and the brows were tightly attached. If it wasn't for the Highness who said that it could effectively kill tiny creatures and prevent the wound from being eroded by evil plagues, she really felt that it was no different from torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the coolness brought by the herbs quickly dispelled the burning pain. After dressing the wounds, she suddenly felt a lot of comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your back..." The Marquise whispered, "Don't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What happened to the back?" Lightning drilled into the tent with a bundle of firewood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She killed me...by the arrows of those people," Speer’s voice sounded a bit low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing wrong with it, it is equivalent to being hit by a few punches," said the night, "I can't sleep at most tonight." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s better to apply some herbs," lightning bolted the branches in the fire pit, splashing the starting point of the ignition star. "The medicine of the leaves not only stops bleeding, but also has a bruising effect." It’s pretty good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey, I’m squatting on me,” McGonagall sat down and patted his thigh. “I’ll give you medicine.” ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the serious look of the white-haired girl, the night is not over, and finally she nodded. "Okay."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undressing, she grabbed her chest, squatted on the squatting leg, and then heard the woman Marquis sucking her breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not look at it, the original smooth back must be red and swollen, a piece of blue and purple, but just looking scary, she did not think so, This kind of scar can't be anything for a witch with a strong self-healing ability, and it will dissipate after two or three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of the medicine, the nightingale coughed two times and said: "What are your plans for the next, Marquis adults? Your brother, Redwin, was received by the church. I’m scorning and turning away from you. Before that, neither he nor the church knew you were a witch.” She simply told the story she had heard in the tower. “They should be directed at you. If you are not a witch, you will be killed as a devil's minion - this is not a difficult thing for the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "They dared to openly murder a Marquis," Speer gnawed. "I want to let Redwin and the church pay the price!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church The matter is far beyond your imagination," the nightingale shook his head. "Even if it is a king, they won't squint before they start. - Yongdong and wolf are the best examples."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spellton’s moment, after a while, he said: “Is the church really planning to annex it? Great Kingdom? I only heard this in the mouth of some neighboring businessmen, but most of the nobles of Wangdu think that this is just nonsense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wang The nobles also said that Roland Wimbledon was a rebel," she shrugged. "If the Highness did not guess wrong, it was only the first step of the church plan, but I can't tell you the hidden plot behind this, unless You join the Witch Alliance. It is certainly not a day or two for the church to plan this coup. Your subordinates should have turned to Redwin who sells more benefits. If you want to recapture the Dragon Ridge, you can also His Royal Highness is asking for help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
