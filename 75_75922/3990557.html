			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just had just stepped out of the study, and the nightingale appeared from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is Mrs. Roser and Miss Kingfisher? What is the fame stunt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, this is really a difficult question to answer. Roland walked to the window and pretended to be sighing. In fact, it was to prevent the other party from seeing his expression. "Two women who meet each other, I am not with them." They are not familiar with their real names. The communication between the aristocrats is like this, always with a false mask, and most of the time they are playing on the spot. After separation, they will forget each other."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he said that the two miss you very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough...this, they don't miss me, but me The golden dragon, status and power, then I was a prince after that. So after being separated into Bianbu Town, they also had no contact with me - if it is really missing, it will not be so indifferent?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night can only distinguish the authenticity of speech, but can not directly judge the truth of the matter, so Roland Given the art of display misleading, Quxianjiuguo, eliminate doubt from the side of the nightingale. Adding to the fact that these shit are not related to him, there is no pressure in the heart. "As for fame and stunts... this is more complicated. In short, Joel can rely on the skills of the hand to win the woman's favor, just like His name is the same as "the magic hand." I used to know nothing about this and I was naturally curious, but I don't need it now, isn't it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and looked at the nightingale, and the latter did not know why he suddenly turned his eyes away, and a red light appeared on his cheeks. "Calm... yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, this should be the case. Roland gave a slight breath in his heart, although at the beginning you can let the nightingale wait outside, but there is always It hurts her trust, and secondly, it is not safe if there is an accident. After all, Sylvie is still checking the entire palace, and the list of gems has not yet been found. It is better to be safe at this time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dinner, Roland finally saw the great explorer from the fjord, Thunder.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was wrapped tightly, with a hood on his head and a scarf around his neck. If it wasn’t for the nightingale to pick him up and Margaret, I’m afraid that this line of guards will not let go. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After walking into the study, the Thunder took off his coat and scarf and bowed to Roland. "I have been from Margaret and Youra. I have heard your name, Dear Roland Wimbledon, thank you for your care of lightning. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also want to thank you for your care of Tilly," Roland looked at him with great interest. "I heard that she moved to the island after she got to sleep." A lot of your help. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has the same golden short hair as the lightning, with a brownish-yellow skin, a strong figure, and a rough, dense corner. It is connected with the scum, covered with half of the cheeks and chin; when you talk about it, you can see that it is full of people who wander around the sea all the year round. It is exactly the same as the light and silent image when you first enter the room.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a little help, she helped me more on my adventure. Without the help of a witch, the current fleet is probably the Shadow Islands. "Thunder smiled. "I naturally can't reach the sea where I have never set foot before, and I witnessed the existence of the sea line. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sea line? Roland was curious. "What is that?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A wall made of sea water, but the ship can be arbitrarily overturned," Thunder detailed his own story. "This is what I came to you." the reason. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland was completely stunned after listening, the sea water ignored gravity, and the ladder formed a height difference? And the ship can sail vertically upwards. It’s incredible! It’s like a huge wave in his heart. If the other person is not a Thunder, not the most famous explorer, he is even hard to believe in this description.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the gravitational force of this place has been distorted, forming a unique gravitational field - but the principle of the formation of gravitation is not clear in itself, so Roland can not draw conclusions at the moment. The omnipresent magic of the world, he can only guess that the cause of the sea line may be related to magic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
