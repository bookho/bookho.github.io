			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After four days, the high-level officials of the North and Hermes were able to gather in the camp on the outskirts of the Holy City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergency assembly order clearly caused everyone’s concern, but no one showed a flustered look, whether it was the staff or the Western Army officer, just guessing whether With new goals, a similar discussion continued until the king’s sullen face entered the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is an important thing to say to everyone," Roland knocked on the table. "We must return to the Winter City."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This short command instantly caused a commotion in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of receiving the secret letter, he has not made up his mind, after all, the contents mentioned in the letter are all obtained through Luo Jia. People are shocked, but there is no other proof. For the cause and effect of the accidental encounter with the devil, the letter did not make too much description, and the devil's army was unclear, and the change of the combat plan involved a lot, so that he was somewhat uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the next few days, Roland received several direct letters from the West – a variety of animal messengers looking at the dust, he realized I am afraid that this is not the same thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the second and third letters recorded the news that Luo Jia was rescued, the slang devil and the no winter city rang the alarm; the fourth and fifth The letter is about the arrival of the sleeping island witch and the internal discord. Each one is a key event worth reporting. It should be the first one in the order of delivery, but the actual situation is reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can also be seen that as the urgency of intelligence increases, the messenger responsible for the communication becomes more and more advanced, so that the recently issued secret letter is instead One arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with these letters, Roland finally got a general understanding of the whole picture. The lightning-specific map mentioned in the third secret letter also confirmed him from the latter. Luo Jia did go to the ruins of Takira and planned to temper his skills and take the devil and the evil beast. To improve your combat level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the reliability of intelligence is guaranteed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, this attachment of the wolf woman also made him feel a little emotional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it that the persuasion of his first time is too heavy to stimulate her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the end result is good, the symbiotic species of the sundial successfully saved the life of Luo Jia, and the whereabouts of the devil were also known in advance - if it waits until the autumn No winter, I am afraid that the enemy has already stood firm in the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this credit, it’s no exaggeration to give her an outstanding contribution award. Perhaps after returning, it is necessary to satisfy the desire of the martial arts fan, and to arm her into a self-propelled heavy firepower unit - this kind of improvement is at least much faster than tempering skills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reason for the event is this," Roland told the key message on the secret letter, and looked at the people in the room with a solemn look. "Given the situation, The two-ribbed offensive plan can only be suspended in advance. From now on, the troops will prepare for the march and withdraw from the holy city in batches. I will set off in advance and strive to return to the winter city in the shortest possible time."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere on the scene suddenly became dignified. Most of the people who attended the meeting had already heard about the devil, and they knew that they were the enemy of the entire gray fort, and even human beings. I really played against the enemy. I was a bit stunned by the sudden sexyness of this purpose. I didn’t know how to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also knew that the news was too surprising and unpredictable, so there was no urging, but quietly waiting for everyone to digest and think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the staff officer Sir Sir Silt raised his hand. "Your Majesty, is this information... reliable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not so easy to forge something, whether it’s Soloya’s layer imprint or honey animal messenger,” Roland said. “Although no second confirmation, but consider It is not easy to approach the devil and can be treated as a special case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
