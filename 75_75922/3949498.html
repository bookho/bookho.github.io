			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annan nodded and stretched the black fire into a silk thread, gently against the spar column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches couldn’t help but hold their breath, only to see the green smoke coming from the two parts of the contact - it was not the color of the smoke itself, but Under the green fire, there are different shades of light and shade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black fire is embedded in the spar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" asked Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a little hard, but it can be cut," Anna answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the "ice" changed, and with a crisp squeak, several cracks spread from the black fire embedded position, like a spider The net is generally covered with the entire cylinder in the blink of an eye. Almost at the same time, Sawyer propped up the barrier and wrapped the witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the unexpected burst did not occur, and the broken spar collapsed like a fall, revealing a chilly core - this transparent The cylinder is composed of two layers of structure, and the inside is a real ice crystal. In an instant, everyone felt the chill of the face, and the temperature around it dropped sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Anna quickly maintained the temperature of the fall and brought it back to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the baking of black fire, the ice crystal melts faster, the transparency also drops sharply, the shape is no longer angular, and it shrinks like ordinary ice. melt. However, Tilly noticed that there was no water in the big pool on the ground, and the melted parts were all turned into smog, just like “Hail” never existed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the ice crystals melted out, the woman who was sealed in it revealed the true body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still seems to be in a deep sleep, long hair and robes are not wet, everything is the same as when it was frozen. Losing the support of the column, her body was unable to fall backwards, and then was held in her arms by the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you still alive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it is very weak, the heartbeat does not stop," Ashes Pressing on the other's chest by hand, "This...is incredible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s unbelievable, Tilly found that since she came to Bianbu Town, she did not In the time of arrival, more things have been seen than ever before. However, she was also relieved and could survive in the extremely low temperature ice crystals. Its identity has been confirmed - the other is a witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This adventure is not nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for her name, her origins, and why she is trapped in the remains, these doubts can wait until I go back and ask again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Andrea was a little bored by the empty side, and looked at the bottom of the hole from time to time, hoping to see Tilly return in the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no traces of the devil around the ruins, even the evil beasts are rarely seen. Occasionally, the common wolf species emerge from the woods. Or wild boar species, even before they can open the bow, the nightingale has nailed the dagger to their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of time seems to be getting slower. Apart from her, all the people staying at the hole are the helpers witches, even if they want to find a personal chat to pass the time. Not enough. Although the woman named Wendy looked very kind, Andrea could not make the decision to take the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mid-level aristocrat, elegance and restraint are essential qualities for unmarried women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget it, or talk to the night owl, I heard that she had played with the ashes, and played well. Since it is to inquire about the information of the old rivals, it is not an initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is just a necessary job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman, who has a golden curl and looks as elegant as a nobleman, has always been leaning on the basket, but now she has lost her sight. By the way, her ability seems to be hiding her body shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Andrea calms down to feel the sound around, when the vision can’t come in handy, the ears and nose are good for capturing the opponent’s whereabouts. helper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she heard the footsteps of the sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a nightingale? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Andrea feels cold and vertical, these footsteps are obviously not a person can send out - there is a group of people who are approaching here, just in In the jungle ahead, it is only a hundred steps away from yourself! But when she looked around, her eyes were still calm, and even a figure could not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps are soon close at hand, hell, the enemy is transparent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just wanted to give an alarm, and a roar suddenly burst into her ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire shines in the air, and then the air sways, a strange monster emerges - it has a narrow head and sharp eyes It looks like a mutated cockroach, but unlike any insect, it is walking upright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow from the musket shattered its side face, black blood spurted out of the skull and almost splashed onto Andrea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster crashed to the ground, and then she saw the white cloak and hood fluttering at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the second shot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, you care about it! Andrea clenched her lips and she noticed it all earlier than herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She summoned the magic longbow, but did not know where to shoot, but had to slowly retreat back to the basket and stand with other witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four shots, four monsters fall, all are one blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the nightingale appeared again beside a monster, Andrea took up his weapon and walked quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not the evil beast, the devil," she squatted The enemy's minions and handcuffs, "but from the blood color, it is more like a beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did you find them?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the beginning of their appearance," the nightingale smiled. "In the fog, the magical brilliance on them is as conspicuous as the stars in the night sky."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can a beast have this ability?" Andrea frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party smiled, "Hey... probably a mixture of special ones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This At the time, the witch who went to the depths of the cave also returned to the ground. In addition to the original seven, there was a blue-haired woman on the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is the helper in the ruins?" Andrea greeted the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Tilly nodded. "The details go to the Yuanwang and I will say more, staying in this forest for a long time, I feel The more uneasy. Right, there is no dangerous situation on it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “There are a few strange mixed species of evil beasts, but they are all dead, The nightingale shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot air balloon quickly inflated and the basket passed over the top of the treetop and began to move towards the town. At this moment, Sylvie gave a cry, "Scorpio, what is it underneath? Evil beast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evil beast? "The Andrea probe looked in the direction of the ruins, but did not see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
