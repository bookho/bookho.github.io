			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original...this is actually the case! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mein stared at the illusion of this scene, and the shock in his heart could not be added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transformation ceremony of the gods was actually invented by the witch. In order to defeat the devil, they did not hesitate to use their own kind as a victim... There are several people who will stand up on the spot. Reprimand her for her ruthlessness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final result was beyond his expectation. After half a quarter of an hour, no one stood up, even the witch who questioned the ceremony did not openly oppose In the words of Carlis, she just bite her teeth and squat down the table. "I am ironic! Killing many witches by hand, but for the continuation of the witch, there is something more ridiculous than this!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she is right," said an elderly witch. "We are born out of mortals. When all humans perish, witches will cease to exist."<br />< Br /> /> </ br> </ br> Shrug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can God's penalty army be able to defeat the devil?" Someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Akaris said again. "No one knows the answer before I try. The failure of two previous battles of God." A lot of questions have been explained, that is, the power of the devil is far better than us, and only the red fog that limits their actions - this means that even if we create a large number of god warriors, we may not be able to achieve the ultimate victory." Suddenly, "But you should know my style of doing things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illian smiled. "Even if there is only one possibility, you must do your best." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would like to follow you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the continuation of the witch."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to admit defeat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd stood up and saluted the king of witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch who raised the question finally stood up and said: "I hope you are right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "So that's it," Akaris nodded. She could see that she was not surprised by the result. "The next step is to convince the other members of the federation."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They don't necessarily listen to you," said the older witch. "If you want to carry out the transformation of the gods without resistance, the witch can't exist as a high privilege, the union must be dissolved, the past Everything that happened happened to be completely buried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will try to convince them," Akarisâ€™ voice is unwavering. "If they are unacceptable, comet. The city will promote this plan alone and recast the new order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the picture disappears...the darkness swallows everything again, when the light in the closet returns to normal Mein found that his back had been soaked in cold sweat and his mind was dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You seem to be a little tired, need me to help you out?" Jie Luo came over and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you are going to open the door!" He gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the metal door was pushed open, Mayn stumbled out of the illusion, slammed his mouth down the prayer table and stumbled in front of Oberlin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the magic stone starts, the picture will be automatically reflected in your brain, so it is normal to feel uncomfortable," Pope whispered, "I first time The reaction when you touch these is the same as you, and you can recover after a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why didn't I have anything?" Jie Luo asked the Pope's arm to ask . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you are a witch, the body has long been used to the magic of running," Oberlin smiled kindly, "Whether it is endurance or resistance, the witch It is generally better than mortal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
