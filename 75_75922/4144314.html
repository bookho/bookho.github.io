Help, I can’t turn, who will help me?-!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Roland thought about how to make better use of Rubik's cube power, the familiar screams suddenly sounded in the courtyard. He subconsciously looked up and saw that the car did not travel around the courtyard road, but rushed into the central flowerbed, sitting in the car is the mystery after the replacement of Sylvie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, this idiot!" Lily bit her teeth, "Quickly brake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I stepped on... but I can't step on it!" the mystery shouted in a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The out-of-control steam car turned left and right in the flowerbed, rushing out of the flower garden and hitting the castle gate -<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, beware!" Wendy's face changed dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly flies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to go, Roland looks at the mystery of the closed eyes holding the steering wheel, and the car without the throttle can also produce this effect? Is this a female driver from a different world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that none of the surrounding witches had spread out, but stood in front of him. In an instant, all kinds of abilities flocked out - Anna's black fire wall, the lotus gully separated a barrier between him and the courtyard; Iphi's magic cage and Andrea's light The arrow has been aiming at the wheel and ready to go, and the nightingale grabbed his arm and was ready to drag him into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing that prevented the car accident was the self-defeating Filith and Loja. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time they stopped in front of everyone, grabbed the vehicle's anti-collision bar and lifted its front wheel off the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny manipulated the black fire to close the ritual cube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steam engine that lost its pressure quickly subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are big - silly - melon!" Lily jumped over the gully, climbed the rut and gave the slap in the back of the mystery, calling her The sound was taken into the belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter opened his eyes and looked at his head innocently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mystery Month!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see the warmth and the scrolls, the mystery I reacted. "I'm sorry, I was wrong--" However, it was too late to apologize at this moment. The head of the detective regiment was able to defend in the future and was dragged directly into the castle by the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every time you have a disaster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This week's vacation, cancel!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rules of the Witch Alliance, copy another hundred times!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are five sets Exercises, eat only when you are finished!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the mourning of the mysterious moon disappeared into the castle, the witches felt awkwardly - of course, Does not include the Queen's Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The car I checked, there was no problem with the steering and braking mechanism," Anna has completed the inspection work and returned to Roland. "Mystery There are only one reason for the deviation from the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her strength is too small." Anna reluctantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but laugh out, because the strength was small and he couldn’t get enough direction, and finally it’s causing “to eat pears”... Before the steering and brake booster is installed, those who have less than or equal to a mystery month can only decline to participate in the test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please let me first board the car!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Oh, it’s my first come!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtyard is once again covered by everyone’s laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Adult, arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage slowly stopped in front of a pub, Victor Lothar walked out of the carriage and lost two silver wolves Give the driver, then walked into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are here, Mr. Victor!" Soon a pretty woman in a white robes ran over and took the baggage in his hand enthusiastically. "Your room owner has been ready, please come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still the largest compartment on the top floor, all the furnishings in the room keep him away The appearance of the time, including incense, wine and the maid who served him - the bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor nodded with satisfaction. This is the power of money. Although it can't reverse life and death, it has the magic to make time solidify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The time you left this time is really long." The bells and hands open the curtains, set the windows, and pour him hot tea." The boss guessed whether you were a robber or a shipwreck when you went out to sea. You can’t come back anymore. He has to check the gold dragons you left every day to see how long it will cost. While I want to rent the house to others in advance, I dare not violate the contract law of the Winter City. The appearance of the dilemma is really a laugh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the lively and quick-serving maid, Victor felt that the fatigue accumulated over the long journey had dissipated a bit. "You said that you are not afraid of being known by him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The brass bell spit out his tongue. "Unless you secretly tell him. Right, where have you been? How busy are you doing business?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Victor licked the lipstick tea. "I have basically stayed in the South for half a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what about the South? The bell is smashing, "Isn't it a gem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are gems anywhere, as long as you know how to find it." He shrugged Shrug, "For example, in the south, the gems grow on the branches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., you are teasing me again." The maid snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor smiled, he knew that the other would not believe it, and in fact he couldn’t believe it even before he saw it himself. The gems are still beautiful. The seeds cultivated by Miss Yeh can be described as incredible. When the shrub grows up, the cotton that blooms in the flower is large and soft, white as snow, and hardly like the thin cotton mites in his memory. It is the same crop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And during the planting period, he was not idle. From the hometown to mobilize the tailoring team, recruiting people in Bishui Port, and liaising with the people to prepare for the business road, they will be busy immediately after harvesting in the cotton field. The things that followed were even smoother than he had imagined. Once the new cotton was launched, it quickly overwhelmed other similar goods with extremely high quality and approachable prices. From quilts to cotton quilts, each item has achieved considerable sales in every city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course Victor has not forgotten what he said, and when other merchants buy cotton seeds from Miss Ye’s winter, this part of the market is bound to suffer. extrusion. Therefore, he has prepared a series of high-end products on the basis of simple cotton fabrics. The content is mainly based on complete sets of clothing. From design, materials to tailoring, the route of excellence is refined, and the cuffs and collars of each garment are embroidered. A unique five-color gemstone logo to showcase your uniqueness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of clothing with the style of the upper class is quickly recognized by some people, and gradually has a special nickname, "Rainbow Stone" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, he did not give up those low-priced goods, whether it is quilts or robes, they are marked with the same mark - the only difference is that the logo is used The line is monochrome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
