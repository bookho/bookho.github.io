			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner is delivered by the attendant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lid was uncovered, Anne had already smelled the scent. There is a thick stack of golden bread in the iron box. At first glance, it is known to be kneaded with peeled fine wheat flour. In addition, there is a small packet of butter and a pot of broth, which is enough for five people to enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Spoons, dishes, etc. are all in the kitchen cabinet, there will be breakfast to be delivered tomorrow, so there is no need to keep food overnight." The attendant said in an orderly manner. "Before you don't get a formal ID card, please don't leave the diplomatic building at will. In addition, the basement is forbidden to enter. If you want to practice your ability, you can go to the top floor. On the first floor, there is a service room, I will sleep there, what is needed? Please feel free to come to me. Unlike the hotel, all services are free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five people listen to each other until the other person is involved After leaving, I will not return to God for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the way the big nobility entertained? It’s exactly the same as in the drama," Amy said with a sigh. "There is something wrong with the lines." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example?" Broken sword and hero curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like a respected lord, I am honored to serve you...and this is usually the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are not a nobleman, he naturally would not say that." On the 76th, he chuckled. "No matter what, eat first, my stomach is hungry."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s also true." The crowd swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, is this the honey attack launched by the King of Greysburg? There was a worries in Anne’s heart that seemed to be a slap in the face, but the heads of the Witch Alliance did not even ask their abilities. This inconsistent move made it difficult for her to judge the other's intentions. If she is alone, and now has four more companions around her, she must be more cautious and never make any mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safest way to be unquestioned is to stay away from the West – the church is now declared annihilated, and the biggest enemy is no longer there. As long as they find a village or town close to a big city, they can hide their identity and live as they did in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, this method does not work now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the 76th swaying to the table, she couldn't help but sigh. In any case, the Witch Alliance does have the ability to heal the disabled, and the prospects described are quite attractive. Now that she sees the dawn of letting the hero stand up again, she naturally can't take the four people away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, fill your stomach first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie put a buttered bread in her mouth and suddenly felt an unprecedented soft sweetness filled with mouth, delicate to no gravel The bread is almost bitten and can easily flow into the throat without chewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, this honey attack... is too fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she thought so in her head, she couldn’t help but touch her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to eating and drinking in the room, almost no one spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sigh of relief until there was only a few crumbs left in the iron box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we still eat such food in the future?" Broken sword reluctantly sucked every finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Should be...not very likely," Amy lifted the soup pot and poured the fragrant broth into five bowls evenly. The golden noodle soup There are still a few green onions and circle of oil blossoms, which is particularly attractive. "This kind of bread should be something that the upper aristocrats can afford. My father usually eats only rough bread."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very good to have thick bread. Don’t forget that when we first arrive in the morning, it’s hard to fill our stomachs.” The hero blew his breath and couldn’t wait to drink a long drink. Then, a heating is taken from the mouth, and there is a long-lost satisfaction in the low-lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
