			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day after returning to the castle in Bianbu Town, the Iron Axe brought all the information he had tried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These people are just the advance troops of Feike?" Roland asked with a frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is true, Your Highness," the iron axe nodded. "As you have guessed before, sending one team after another to attack the West is a mention." Feike Wimbledon's strategy of combat. In addition to the West, he used the same method to deal with Garcia Wimbledon in the clear water port."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They Are all civilians?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not all, criminals, mice, the most are refugees from all over the country." He replied, "according to the enemy According to the Cavaliers, after Fei Keke forced these people to force them, they first promised to stabilize them with some oral promises, and then took the first batch of pills. In this way, they had to be controlled by Tiefko and wanted to get More pills to relieve pain and craving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they don't know, once they swallow the pill, there is no possibility of treatment," Roland sighed deeply. "More pills are just a matter of delay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Highness. Tiffco did not Drug side effects to tell the militia, after they thought he was full of "new king" combat, you can get the identity and reward his promise. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the purpose of this team? Roland asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bianyi Town," Iron Axe quickly replied, "because the already-dead Sir Vincent believes that the town has no walls, it is easier to consume." In this goal, he predicted that a thousand militia swallowing pills could be exchanged for about 3,000 casualties, which would be a heavy blow to Bianyan Town. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what? "<n /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Snak also confessed that Feike gave him another task, which was to divide the militia into several offensive towns to ensure their own safety. Observe your coping style and combat effectiveness. I think... he should have noticed that the last attack did not return the leader knight. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time, no one is returning," the prince shrugged. "Since it is an advance force for consumption, the two know Tefco's follow-up attack." Planning? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is not much to know, but the scale will be much larger than the previous two attacks. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland's heart suddenly hates itchy teeth, this is a living labor force, so a wave of it is consumed as cannon fodder? Even if it is unscathed Conquering the enemy is also a terrible victory. It is more important to stop this meaningless war than to resist the attack of Tiffco. Otherwise, how long will it take for the population to re-emerge after the unification of the gray castle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the fall of the demon, the entire western land will be blocked by heavy snow, and the large units will be unable to move. By shipping, the queue will be long and costly. Not to mention huge, it is easy to be intercepted by halfway. He spoke. "So if he wants to launch this round of offensive this year, he must act before the winter snowfall." It is necessary to search for the population earlier, at least to complete the recruitment of the militia before the winter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are going to..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland closed his eyes and thought for a moment before continuing Said, "I want to delay this war. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you send messengers to him or send a diplomatic letter?" Tefco Wimbledon may not be as you wish. "The iron axe said in a hurry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s not very useful," he said slowly. "I want the other person to dispel the attack. First, reduce it." He can search for the population, and the second is to make him realize that the war of attrition is of little significance and he is jealous of the West. I originally intended to let Barov arrange to spread the news of the West Front Pioneer, attracting the poor people outside the city to go on their own, but now it seems that the effect is too slow, and the measures are too conservative. If you want to take the population away before Tefco, you must take the initiative to contact and recruit them, just like the last trip to Wangdu. The most important thing is the south of the war, followed by the Kingdom of the North, which is estimated to require the first army to execute. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is only for recruitment, a team of 50 people is enough," Iron Axe did not hesitate to take the lead. "After all, it is not near the city, but also No need to worry about confronting the enemy. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
