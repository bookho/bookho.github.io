"Go outside and breathe fresh air."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... no," Axia saw that the nightingale had reached the body and looked at the wound calmly. In the face of such a bloody scene, she can still do nothing... she must persist, at least not to lose her face. "I... vomit... much better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When was he discovered?" The nightingale turned back and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today dawn, the surrounding residents screamed at the sky and went out to fetch water and found his body - the door was so open, like intentional “Show it to others,” said Ryan. “If it was before, I’m afraid we have to wait two or three days to receive the news, but recently the City Hall is rewarding the report, so someone immediately reported it to the City Hall.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the identity of the deceased?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iron, free people," Rennes looked around the house. Decoration, "Nothing... um, I should have been a mouse before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have anyone seen him at night?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked, no."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sound?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Also...no one heard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To kill such a big person, you have to make a little noise," Fawn frowned. " Even cutting the throat He will not die immediately, and beating the floor or dying should be able to cause a lot of movement. Are you sure they are not lying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This... "Not at all," Rehn hesitated. "There was a murder. The residents here are heart-wrenching. Besides, helping the police catch the murderer can also get extra rewards. They have no reason to lie."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way, you call the people around you, I personally ask again. And... Axia." The night owl looked at the assistant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" The latter trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You go to the castle and call Soroya over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... Ok."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asha slammed out the door and ran to the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, she feels that the nightingale’s command is so beautiful, and there is a strong self-confidence in the gestures. It’s no wonder that His Highness will entrust the security to she was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When returning to the streets again, Axia is surrounded by Soloya. There are two more people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can this kind of thing not call me?" Lightning flew into the room and shouted loudly, "His Royal Highness is eccentric!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" McMug is close behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They...you have to follow," Axia was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I am not here, shouldn’t you protect your Royal Highness?" The night brows, "This is not an adventure game!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, there is Silvi, no one can easily get close to him," Lightning squeezed his eyes. "And His Highness is about to hold a nobility meeting, stay in the castle hall. What are the dangers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s incredible... Axia thought, why can these two people face the bloody terrible murder scene so indifferently? Especially lightning, obviously a little older than myself, and there is still a trace of excitement in his eyes... When the gods are on, become witches, what have they experienced in the end? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is..." Rennes and a policeman looked at the one person and one bird floating in the air and widened their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey..." Lightning muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, did you let me come to paint this body?" Soroya finally walked into the room, Asha noticed that her face was no more than herself. How much better, my heart was a little calmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s a murderer," the nightingale closed the door and told the arrest plan. "With the portrait of the perpetrator, post it to the square." The area is rewarded, this should be the fastest way to find him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deer sir snorted, "You mean, this witch... ...Miss Asha can reproduce the murder process?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't necessarily work, we still need some luck due to the duration of the illusion, you will be there later. I know." The nightingale nodded to Axia, "Get started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the latter closed her eyes and, according to her instructions, A retrospective is placed between midnight and dawn. In the darkness, the magic emerged from the fingertips, intertwined, and gradually formed a clear image - wood, bed, table, room... In her mind, a new house was shaped. The deceased lay on the ground, the blood ran down the rugged mud, and the door that should have been locked was pushed open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... is the witch's ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's simply unbelievable ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, these fantasies are too realistic, and they are the power of the devil." -<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Shut up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispers of the police came around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that he is dead at this time," Axia felt someone patted her shoulder, it was a nightingale, "Don’t waste magic, change time "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second time back to midnight, the figure on the floor suddenly disappeared, and the deceased appeared on the bed, seemingly sleeping well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this mean...he died within the time shown in the two illusions?" Ryan asked doubtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, from midnight to three o'clock - this one and a half hours is the time for the murderer to start."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand! Miss Axia's ability can't last too long, it is likely to miss the murder process, so you said that you need a little luck!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly the case," said the Nightingale. "Thinking that after a murder, it takes a long time to leave a mark, and it will be reproduced from the time of three o'clock."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axia nodded, spit out the turbidity, and again exerted the ability to control the retrospective point between 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock, the magic surged to the empty wall. Virtual constitutes a stranger standing. He is using a blanket of blood and what is on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to have been found," the nightingale raised his mouth. "My luck is really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This person is the murderer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The appearance is ordinary... I thought it was at least a burly man." Lightning disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This can only draw the side," Soloya looked at the wall panel. "Is there any way for him to turn around?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Axia, handed it to you." The nightingale commanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," she didn't need to elaborate on the other side and she knew what to do. The last illusion moved forward for a quarter of an hour. This time, everyone is clear. The ground saw the true content of the murderer - he first strangled the shovel with a rope, then dragged the other to the floor, and took out the dagger and cut his throat. The entire process did not make any resistance to the shovel, which was like sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan seems to be aware of something and turns to look at the water tank at the corner of the house. "He was poured into the dream water?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
