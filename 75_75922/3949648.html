			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, the vessel arrived at the river pier in the Changge District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was news that Pei Luo had already been waiting for him to return to the castle, and a grand welcoming dinner was held in the first floor lobby. Since the complete possession of the long song fortress, Roland’s mentality has also changed. Looking at the aristocrats who are intertwined between the seats, he always feels that Pedro is using his own money to entertain himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two sentences of the eldest son of honeysuckle, he entered the topic, "Will those mice start to come out again?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the reports we received, it seems to be the case," Peello made a gesture of asking to bring the prince to the corner of the hall. "It’s just compared to the previously organized Black Street group, now caught. The criminals are all individual acts, such as theft, robbery, murder, etc., but all that are caught are taken to the square and sentenced to hang. But you ask us to have sufficient evidence, so the prisoners disposed are only a very small part of the report. It’s a lot of time to check these messages, and...” The eldest son of honeysuckle paused. “We recently had a big problem.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone publicly boycotts your policy, Your Highness." Pedro worried, "The specific thing is that Earl Mead knows a little more clearly." I will let him talk to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear His Royal Highness, Elk pays tribute to you." After being called, Rennes bowed to the prince and then began to explain the incident. "There has been a big event in the North Street recently... Well, according to Weide. The Minister’s statement should be called a serial killing case.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, that’s what he said, Roland’s time is coming,” he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Rene Meade sighed. "From three days ago, every night, every household was killed at home, their What they have in common is that they are all male, living alone, without family members. The most important thing is that they have all reported their work to the City Hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince brows up "They are all formal workers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the handyman is officially working," the Earl of Elk nodded, "There is still room in the room of each victim." The next picture: a crown and a red cross, painted with blood. It is because of this mark that I The City Hall asked for the name of several people who were going to build a house in Chishui District."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you think their purpose is... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Destroy your recruitment plan, Your Highness," he replied. "This matter has been publicized in North Street, saying that it is only necessary to report to the City Hall." , will be targeted by the killer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too," Peello took the road. "There were fewer recruits than expected. Now almost no one in North Street dared to sign up." Now, the City Hall has added a number of repentant city people, saying that they are unwell and can't leave the city for the time being. I hope that officials can remove their names. Nowadays, the news is only circulating in the North Street. If it is transmitted to other neighborhoods, it may have an adverse impact on your construction plan. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought for a moment, "Did you find any clues about the murderer?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Ryan opened his mouth and said for a long time, "No one saw the scene of the crime, sent people to search and did not know where to look." Come up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," he couldn’t help but be a little surprised. "How did you solve this kind of thing before?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean the patrol? "The young Elk Earl hesitated. "As far as I know, they have no fixed practice. If the influence is great, the victim’s family appeals to the lord, and the lord decides to give the people a fair word, they will test the Heijie gang and let the mouse hand over the prisoner. As for the scapegoat, the patrol does not care. . If they are outsiders or solitary people, they generally choose to turn a blind eye. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply too lawless, Roland is secretly screaming, so that the judicial power is almost equal to handing over to the mouse, no wonder some people will say that the mouse is The other side of the city is governed. In addition, this era seems to have no criminal investigation at all. Once the murder is unseen, there are ten ** is the case - of course, only civilians.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
