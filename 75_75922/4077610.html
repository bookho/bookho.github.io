			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Doing this... really doesn't matter?" The echo passed through the window of the command post, looking at the sand people who were tumbling over the dock. There was a hint of unbearable color on the surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They never know what discipline is, the life they have experienced has always been a weak meat, and they want to make this group come to use as soon as possible, in addition to war. Only this method is up." The iron axe replied respectfully. "You have not been in the extreme south for a long time. The patriarchs are also very caring for you, so you may not know the nature of these small clan. This level of lesson is not What counts, even can be said to be very necessary, otherwise they will only think that Aosa is not prestige, weakness can be bullied."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of his rare Hesitated, "I think you may not adapt much because it is... Sometimes your Majesty is too kind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly agree," now Andrea at the window shrugged. "There is a saying in the nobles that radishes and sticks are the best way to rule the people. The thicker the radish, the more lord the lord."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is radish?" Hummingbird is curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A food, just like the corn under the arm, is a specialty of the morning kingdom," Andrea explained. "But the radish is thicker than The stick is much finer, so the implication of this sentence is that the punishment is to pay more attention to the reward, and the people will know how to cherish it. The lord like Roland will only be given the title of a defeated family in the Glow City." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a lot of things that make me feel like I agree," Ashes grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably what is special for you?" The hummingbird thought about his chin. "The words he taught Thuram are quite reasonable... ...the collective power is always bigger than the individual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But even Thuram, just forcing those words back," He smiled and shook his head. "If you haven’t been to the Winter City without yourself, you can’t imagine what an incredible new order has been established. I believe that one day, the entire Grey Fortress will become a winter city, but Obviously not now - the whip is more than the language to let them remember the rules of the South."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Echo sighed and did not say anything more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The chief commander," a soldier suddenly entered the command post. "There was a commotion in the Department of Falling Stones and the Qingquan Department. Some people were confronting the Guards. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of boarding?" The look of the iron axe was immediately serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, those who were squeezed into the water called their families and hoped to get the same food and gratuity because they were not unwilling to travel to the Black River Valley. But Aosha refused them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, who is stationed now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The second musket of the musket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call two classes, and the arson boys who want to sign up for the First Army, Let them immediately gather at the turmoil, I will be there soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing the iron axe to leave, the echo couldn’t help but stop him. "Please don't be too harsh on them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter standing The door was silent for a moment, and then she would pray to her. "I understand... Silver Moon, I will take control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the axe The echo returned to the table with some depression. The move of the Shamin to the north is not as smooth as she imagined. It is obvious that as long as the arrangements are made, everyone can live a good life, but someone can always use her words as a lie, even if they have already got a rich land. Still can't believe in her completely, I believe in Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She misses the life of no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she is the head of the clan, she prefers to stand on the top of the castle, overlooking the mountains and the city, singing the days of the songs written by her Majesty, when When the unheard of melody sounds, she can feel the true freedom and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
