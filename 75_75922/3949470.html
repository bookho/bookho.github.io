			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean stood on a rocky hillside overlooking the city ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last time came, Wolf Heart City was far from being like it is now - its walls were made of snowstone from the Kingdom of the Winter, clean and white. It is like a newborn tooth. In just three months, it has completely changed its appearance. The damaged area is filled with local black boulders. When it is too late to repair, it is covered with wooden frames and baffles. The blood of the flowing water is immersed in the cracks of the stone to make it dyed. There was a touch of maroon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a distance, today's walls are rough and covered with dirt, like the weathered old wolf's teeth. Compared to before, it is more like a predator's fangs - it will be even more chilling after biting the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army of the church camped in the position of about five miles outside the Wolf Heart City. In order to prevent the Red Sea Queen from splitting the old holy city, this time the scale was not as good as the last time. There are 5,000 judges and squadrons each, and the gods are about 800. But with a top secret siege weapon and pure, Mayn has full confidence in conquering this wolf king's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The bishop's adult, "The Siege Beast" has been placed in place and can be attacked at any time. "A priest ran to the top of the hill and reported to him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are the pure people who control them?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also ready. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May raised the lookout and observed the position of the "Battle of the Beast" - I saw two huge steel beasts squatting away from the kingdom. In the field, the baffles are placed on both sides and the grass shed is placed on the top. If you don't look at it, it's hard to notice the strange shape of this weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and moving the line of sight forward is the lineup of the gods, they are all transformed from the most devout believers of the church, standing straight in the autumn wind. like a statue. Only the enemies who have played with them will know the terrorist power of these extraordinary warriors. Regrettably, they are unable to act on their own, they must fight through the orders issued by the commanders, who have never appeared in the church publicly. They are also members of the Prisoners in battle, mixed in the ranks, except for the three bishops and popes. No one knows their true identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good," Mayn nodded with satisfaction. "Go back to your position and wait for the attack horn to blow."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is the pure man of the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the two witches, he couldn’t help but frown. They are very different from other witches who are raised by the church, even in marching battles. Still doing my own thing. If you change to the pure person of your own hands, you must be punished by the whipping. But in the church position, they are on equal footing with the bishop, and Mayn can't instruct them either. The Pope is only sending two pure people to "assisted". Fight yourself, not let them "obey" their orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also understands that it is necessary to use their power to completely eradicate hidden dangers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop walked down the hill and came to a tent outside the camp. Opening the curtain, it is not unexpected, the awning is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about Jieluo and Isabella?" He guarded the trial army at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two adults are interrogating the prisoners, and should now be on the east side of the camp," the latter said. "There is a flat open space there. You can see it when you walk over." Do you need me to call them over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you call them, I won't be here. And it’s a captive game... Are they still not tired? Mayn calmly said, "No, I used to look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He quickly found the place where the guards said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw two women standing in the middle of the flat, one leaning forward, and being stuck in the ear of the other three captives who were tied back, whispering What, her expression is gentle and focused, white long hair and robe horns dance with the wind, like an innocent elf. The other woman has a proud figure and a blond curly hair, and occasionally makes a crisp and pleasant laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
