			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can’t help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, for him, the five senses are nothing but the inherent attributes of the world, not a rare thing, and the dream is also regarded as a strange because of weirdness and incompleteness. A fictional fantasy land. But for Felice, this is the perfect world that she dreams of, and its meaning is probably no less than a glimmer of light in the darkness of the darkness of the fingers. No matter what kind of difficulties and obstacles will appear in the middle, it will still Fear in the direction of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If her intrusion is really just an accident, once she leaves, she can’t enter again. What she lost is probably far from what he can imagine – no. It's easy to come to the perfect world that has been lost for a long time, but in the end it only relives the pain, which is too cruel to Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sighed and stretched out and said, "I know, the test will wait until the evening."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days in the dream world is almost equivalent to a whole night in reality, postponed to the evening is equivalent to a few hours late, the problem is not big, but she can use this time to feel Look at this new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Your Majesty..." Felice got up and lifted her elbows to the chest again, and that was what the federation members were upholding. Special etiquette, "I understand some now why you can win the support of the Witch Alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland just prepared to say something, the bedroom door was suddenly knocked The creaking sound came out of the door, "I brew tea, do you want tea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy...again what the hell? According to her usual habits, after being provoked, she will definitely not want to see her for a long time, let alone boil water, and now it is noisy to knock on the door and forcibly drink tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned and opened the door, but the little girl was empty. She first glared at Roland, then the probe came in and looked at Felice, and her eyes were full of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what about tea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the living room, go to your own," Jie Luo coldly snorted, "Right, don't make strange noises, interfere with my homework!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃... Was this the reason? Roland shook his head in a smile, and now the child knows too much. If you change yourself to the same year, you won’t associate it with strange things. I will only ask with concern about where the body is uncomfortable, whether you want to go to the hospital to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-closing the door, he shrugged, "Don't care, the child after zero is this character, after all, the times are different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After zero? The times are different?" Felice looked awkward. "Her relationship with you is...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Residing tenants only," Roland waved his hand, did not elaborate. Although he told the battle of the soul against the pope, he did not tell her that this little devil was the pure Pope. Jielu has gained a new life in the dream world, and has no connection with the past. There is no need to connect her with another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand," she bit her lip. "So... please continue, you can do it in other ways. This time, I will try my best." Sounds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland could not help but hold his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are addicted! There are still many places full of fun in this world, why bother to stare at the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," he cleared his throat. "Since I am in the world of dreams, I will take you out for a walk."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am like this... can I go out?" Felice asked in surprise. "There is obviously not the same as the absence of winter city. It is troublesome to be noticed by others." "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out that she did not fail to notice the drastic changes in her surroundings, but she thought that it was as distinctive as the four kingdoms that discriminate against witches. People will attract discrimination and persecution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
