			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before entering the living room, Prius was searched again. This time, the search was much more meticulous. From top to bottom, every place where the knife or dagger could be hidden was touched, and even the soles were not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he saw the people who defeated the Duke’s coalition in the hall—the four princes of the Grey Fort, the lords of Bentham Town, and the new Westland, Roland Wimbledon. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prince has a long gray hair that symbolizes the blood of the royal family. His face looks very young, at most twenty years old. He did not wear hair and did not wear any crowns. The finger holding the quill pen is slender, and the same, there is no jewelry ring or ring on his hand, not even the bracelet - this is very rare among the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prius Desa, the knight of the Earl of Elk?" Roland leaned back in his chair and looked at the list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness." Prius squatted on one knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been hard to believe until now, that is, a person whose face can’t even see his beard can lead a group of miners and hunters to defeat the Western world. The long-time Duke of Ryan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you read literacy? Read and write? Stand up and answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will , Your Highness, this is the most basic requirement of a knight," Prius swayed and stood up. Suddenly, when some old knights were enshrined, the gray fort was not popular, and Wu Wuquan was added. He added, "I mean , a new batch of knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 30 years, fewer and fewer knights have been enshrined by force and warfare, and other considerations have increased. If you don't write a pen or read a document, it's hard to be seen by the Lord. The rise of outstanding young people like the Hurricane Knight of Wang Du, the dawn of the dawn of the West, is to set the requirements of the Cavaliers to a new height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now, after becoming a trainee knight, the first thing to learn is to read and read, the level is higher, and the etiquette needs to be proficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Prius did not understand why His Highness asked himself this question? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good," the prince nodded. "So I am making a verdict now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sentence made him breathe in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have two choices. One is to mine the mine in the North Slope for 20 years to redeem your sins, and the other is to become a teacher and teach My people learn to read and write words. Miners are not slaves, they also pay, and they can rest for three days a month. Teachers not only have paid, but also free housing, and can rest for two days a week. But if you choose the latter You must work until you are 50 years old to be able to let go of this position. Don't worry, even if you don't do it, the salary will be paid as usual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Prius was relieved a little, and as expected, he did not execute or exile. But these two options made him puzzled. The miners sounded like coolies, but the Highness said there are pay and holidays... Isn’t the teacher’s words only available to people with knowledgeable knowledge? He only knows how to read and write. And what does it mean to teach the people, can you not want to train these civilians as nobles? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that neither of them mentioned how to deal with their territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pris looked up at the prince and cautiously asked: "My Highness, I don't know if I choose one of them, my territory will... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the moment you lifted the sword to me, your territory is no longer yours," Roland said bluntly. At this point, I reached an agreement with the heirs of the Elk family. He will convert the industry in your territory into Jinlong compensation, and after you make your choice, the new count will send the compensation together with your family to Bianbu Town. So that he can vacate new places to recruit knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prius’s heart sinks, but he has a house, a group of chickens and ducks And the fish in the pool, how much compensation can these things be worth? The new count will definitely cut another knife on it... It is hard to say whether there are thirty golden dragons at that time. The count was just dead, and his heirs abandoned himself in this way. This ruthlessness made Prius disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
