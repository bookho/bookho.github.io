			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later, a strangely shaped vehicle slowly entered the test explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the first crawler tractor manufactured by the Winter City Ministry of Industry based on the complete set of drawings and technical guidance provided by the Ashes Design Bureau. It is only the same as the test piece except that the chassis is the same. Surrounded by a thick armor panel, the vehicle looks like a moving square box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After driving into the heartbreaking area, it stayed in front of the melting tower for about half an hour, then turned the front of the car and headed south along the original road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened for almost five kilometers or so, a wheeled truck came close and took all the people in the car, while the square box tractor was abandoned directly in the snow. In the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people went all the way and returned to the winter city from Da Xueshan the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland got the message and called them into the castle for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, haven’t you encountered any surprises?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured, everything It was very smooth.” Felice smiled and presented a piece of stamp to him. “Axia quickly positioned the picture at the time, and we stayed shorter than expected.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because, because there are specific time points, this is not too difficult," Axia is somewhat shy. "I have less control over my ability than other sisters." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, don't be humble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes Really..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took over the seal, but his expression was still serious. He looked to Momo around him, "I am bothering you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you are heavy, kneel." Momo stretched his hand to cover one side of the eye. In order to avoid seeing the king's majesty, and at the same time display the ability. After a few moments, she let go and bowed to Roland. "The numbers and colors of everyone have not changed significantly, which is basically the same as when they started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until then, Roland was relieved and smiled. "It's hard work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You too." The witches echoed in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The living room is ready for meals, chaotic drinks are available in unlimited quantities. Let's fill the stomach first." Looking at the people who are happy, he laughs. Shaking his head. As for the Tachira witch who is involved in the action, it is basically a frequent visitor to the dream world, and there is no need to give any extra reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Axia’s retrospective ability to closely observe the instantaneous changes in the role of weapons, it has always been the most reliant improvement of the engineering department. By adjusting the retrospective speed, you can clearly understand the trend of the state change of the target at every moment, and most of the problems and leaks can be seen at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as mentioned before, the sun's glow is different from other weapons, especially dirty bombs that do not respond completely. Many substances emitting deadly radiation will remain on the scene, and if you rush into it, you will undoubtedly suffer huge amounts of radiation damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, Roland invested in the first crawler tractor prototype and converted it into a radiation-proof vehicle - its left and right rear sides and bottom plate were wrapped It has a multi-layer lead plate with gold foil and enamel in the middle. The overall thickness is up to ten centimeters, which makes it highly shielded for photon, electron and neutron jets. The structural weight of the comprehensive protection is only supported by the steam engine driven by the Rubik's cube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the interior of the vehicle is self-contained with oxygen, which is almost completely isolated from the outside world, avoiding the risk of radiation dust entering the vehicle from the ventilation passage. In order to observe the scene of the explosion, a huge lead-containing glass was placed in front of the car body, and the thickness reached an astonishing 30 centimeters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that the access to the test site may cause the track and armor to adhere to the contaminant, he also specifically requested that the vehicle be replaced as soon as the personnel are sent out of the most dangerous core area. Discard the former directly in the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
