			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aite was frightened and unable to move, watching the other side turn his head and looking at himself, the mucus dripping on the gray-brown tooth can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, I won't eat your cockroaches," the monster suddenly made a murky voice, almost letting Aite scream. Mom, this thing actually speaks! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More surprised him is still behind, a woman jumped from the back of the monster, step by step to the side of Tongshan, turned him over and explored for a while, "This guy is still alive, Mai Mai, send him to Nana Va."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" The behemoth seems to understand her words, lift Two front paws grabbed the captain and fluttered again. The strong airflow rushed to Aite and could not open his eyes. When the snow is a little bit, he looks at it halfway, and the city is empty. For example, everything just happened is just a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not a dream... The woman is still there! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is dark, he can only see the other person's figure, there is no light source around, her pupils are different from the golden awns, like The stars in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reinforcement." He was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What...what?” Aite feels that even a dream is more real than this one. “Are you helping me?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the meaning of His Royal Highness," she crouched down, looking for a long sword from the squashed corpse, and smashed it with her hands. The flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aite feels something in his stomach is tumbling, he retched twice, but nothing can be spit out except for sour water. At this moment, there was another screaming noise from the downstairs of the city. Obviously, the movements and stunned people caused by the giant beasts shocked the enemy - but it was just shocking. They could not see the amazing scene of the city. The movement calmed down and they started to move again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are talking about your Highness... is the prince of the prince of Bentham?" He wiped his mouth and gasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to him, is there a man named Roland?" The black-haired woman began to look for another body weapon, Aite simply turned his head, no Go see her move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Bianbu Town has been at least three days away from here... How can His Highness know the aristocratic rebellion so quickly?" Aite swallowed, " And the monster just now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not a monster, but a witch who saves you," she turned cold. "I don't have time." Answer your questions and stay on the side quietly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the musket blocking, this time the enemy successfully climbed the city, the torch swayed The light illuminates again, only when they find that there is only one woman standing in front of them, they are all in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But very quickly, this stalemate was broken by the unscrupulous low laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aite naturally understands what the laughter contains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the attention of Laozi, don't be overwhelmed by this gang."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't worry, boss, we will help you watch, but later..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I finish playing, it's yours."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿嘿...no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick, retreat to me!" Struggling to climb from the ground, but the next scene made him stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a silver light, and the laughter stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy headed by the sword was smashed into two, and even the shield and the leather armor could not block the blade. He didn't even see how the woman shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is only the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired woman took a step forward and swept the sword, and could not see the other side’s movements, but Aite heard a series of flesh-and-blood friction and broken bones. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the three people had no time to react, and they were cut open to the abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intestines broke out and mixed with blood to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Aite opened his mouth, but didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman looked back at him and said, "Go and bring your remaining companions together on the wall. Someone will pick you up later." Jumping down the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall section here is 30 feet tall! He endured the pain of his body, crawling up to the wall, and looking down, only to see the crowd below turned into a pot of boiling water - the woman ran rampage, the invincible, the arms in the hands flew up and down, like the harvest of wheat Anyone who dares to stand in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy collapses when it is less than half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have never seen such a terrible opponent, they are faster than the Snow Wolf, stronger than the Grizzlies, no one can walk under her sword One round, you can't avoid it. The subordinates of the nobility fled, and the siege was lifted by one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She followed the broken crowd to kill, leaving a path of blood. Aite sat down on the floor and felt the cold sweat soak the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a witch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what... he survived! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The fortress castle was surrounded by dozens of bonfires, and the four family's people were surrounded by water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a day and night of fighting, the second floor of the castle was also conquered, and the rebellion of the honeysuckle family has now shrunk to the top, believing that it is suffering from the double suffering of hunger and fear. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques Meade looked at the lord's castle in front of him, and his heart felt a bit hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After his father died, he rushed back to the territory from the king, just to inherit the position of the count. Now, I have a further opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secret letter of Tiphoco mentioned that if the king can control the long song fortress, when the snow is over, the king will go to the place. , crusade against Roland. Wimbledon. As long as the power of the rebel can be completely eradicated, it is not impossible for the West to hand over to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding the territory acquired by the Earl of Honeysuckle, he will become a veritable duke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Meade, what a wonderful name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this castle will be its permanent place in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Earl of the Earl, the sixth offensive team retired," a knight came over and reported. "They said that the gunfire of the other party has been sparse. Did you change the armored team?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques Meade nodded. "You can arrange it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; The so-called Iron Armor team is a team dedicated to the setting of firearms, usually composed of three or four people. The two held a shield that could cover the whole body and was made of several layers of iron-wrapped wood, with a lookout slot and a shooting hole in the middle, which could be used by the gunmen of the party to fight - in order to make more of these shields, He reluctantly removed ten of the Knights. Of course, the thick iron shield also has weaknesses that are difficult to move, and it is easy to become the target of the opponent when going up and down the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, honeysuckle can’t last long, Jacques sneered in his heart, even though the reaction of the other party was a little too unexpected, before the four family coalitions stormed into the fortress. Some patrolling soldiers and knights have already been transferred to the castle, but after all, they are less than a hundred people, even if they consume it, they can kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
