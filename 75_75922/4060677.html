			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon moon has no sun, this is something that has not changed in thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is always a dark and dark curtain. When you look up, you can always see the snow falling with the wind. The difference is just the size. Like today's weather, occasionally two pieces can be regarded as a snow stop; most of the time, white spots will occupy the entire sky, and densely fall into the white earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this white mans is particularly eye-catching, and the gleaming glow of the earth instantly illuminates the surrounding snow, as if the gray world is bright. A few points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice involuntarily held her breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The line of sight is like a stop at this moment, everything seems quick and slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light quickly dimmed and turned into an orange-red fireball. With this change, the ground outside Baizhang was arched! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely not an illusion. She clearly sees that the flat snowfield rises upwards, forming a supple arc, like the earth under the snow. And the rock, but the water that can change the shape at will. The top of the arc is the red fireball, which is still rising, like breaking free from the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it did it - the next scene was almost in the blink of an eye, smoke and flames erupted from the ground, tearing the curved surface to pieces! The fireball vacated, and the black smoke rolled up a few feet, and it opened into a high wall in front of her vision. Whether it is a cage or a beast, it is turned into a fly ash in front of it. Until then, the roar of the screaming earth was passed to her ear, and at the same time, there was a tremor of horror! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Boom———————Boom———————”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an instant, the ground shakes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis subconsciously seized Ai Gesha, opened her mouth and wanted to say something, but was blocked by the airflow coming from the front. The audience on the wall was also blown away, and it took a while for me to recover from this incredible explosion. No cheers, no cheers, everyone was shocked by this scene, the only thing that can be done, can only look up at the rising smoke wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the...key? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swallowed, and mortals now have such a terrible power? Even a high-level devil can't survive in such a raging fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red sun is getting darker and darker, only a few scarlet flares are looming in the black smoke, but the tumbling smoke has jumped into the air. For example, it is in contact with the cloud. The earth and evil beasts that were sent to the sky were smashed down, and there was a bloody muddy rain in the surrounding snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this scene, Felice finally understood where Aegis’s confidence came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this earth-shaking force, even with the cruel devil, mortals have the opportunity to compete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she never understood why Roland Wimbledon wanted to call it art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the explosion an art? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Litnin is completely intoxicated in this smoke-filled cold wind, that sound The roar completely awakened the desire in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is chemistry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the chemistry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked to his companions - the former King's chief alchemist Rayleigh and Achill, and found the same light shining in their eyes. This kind of radiance is incompatible with the external forms in which the two are gradually entering aging. He vaguely remembers that only when he entered the alchemy square in his teens and was officially accepted as a disciple, he showed such a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to attract everyone's attention like the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only chemistry can do this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he is now nearly 50 years old. If you can see this scene in the early 20 years, I will understand how good the power of chemistry is. . It is not the rough flame and smoke produced by the burning of snow powder, but more pure light and heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, now he finally knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the astrologers who are still stunned, Wright couldn’t help but smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From now on, the study of the sage will only leave one name, and the other will be completely forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants everyone to feel the power of the explosion, praise the greatness of chemistry! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that there were so many chemical explosives to try in Medium Chemistry, he couldn’t help but want to invest in the experiment immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you waiting for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apply to Kaimo Spit Let's have a lab."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same as I thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people agree The opening, but also the same proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrighting finally looked back at the long-lasting smoke column and walked to the laboratory with the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you understand why I want you to stay in Wintertown ?Itis touched Cole's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter was silent for a long time before the voice said dryly, "Because of this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was drawn that he was scared by this amazing explosion. Now his face is still pale, and one hand clasps his sister's arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because no one can resist Roland Wimbledon," said Itis slowly. "The aristocrats in the land are insignificant in the face of such power, as long as he wants What makes the kingdom look like, the kingdom has to become what it is. He said that no nobles are needed, and from that moment on, the nobles should give up their position - unfortunately, most people still don't realize this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are regrets on the mouth, there is no regrettable look on the face of Beidi Pearl, and there are even some feelings of gloating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col. Kant licked his lips. "We... are also nobles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But it is no longer a part of the nobility," Itty said with a ribbon that he was walking to the wall. At this moment people are gradually leaving the wall, and there are many empty spaces around them. In the distance, the black ground that has been plowed is clearly in the eyes of Kohl. The reason why the nobility is admired is because of wealth and power, not the land under the feet. So the nobles will not really disappear, just like this plain, whether the surface is broken or neat, snow or grass The essence will not change. No winter city is the starting point of a new era. To become a nobleman of the new era, it must be integrated into the newly established rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Cole feels that he seems to understand, but he does not seem to understand, but under the sister's many years of accumulation, he still nodded, "I will stay here, no longer clamoring to return to the North." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the right thing. And you don't feel that you are running a business." Is it not as interesting to explore new rules and new forces?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cole looked up and looked at her sister’s pretty face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the north wind, her long hair is like the most silky satin, and the narrow eyelashes are lifted upwards, matching the nose to the lips. The curve has a beauty that cannot be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that puzzles him is that the tidal flush on the face of Isis is like a woman’s unique expression when she is excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
