			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A storm is brewing in the eastern waters of the fjord islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray clouds are very lowly laminated, and there are occasional electro-optic lights passing through the clouds. The dull thunder seems to come from far away, like the gods’ anger. roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty Morgan is in the same mood as this bad weather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been more than two months since I sent Effie and Yu Yu, and there is still no news to this day. This is really unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the two places are far away, it is difficult to transmit the news, as far as she knows, honey is also in the west of the gray fort, as long as the threat to the little guy, grab one Only the animal messenger will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to the lord’s site? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty irritatedly closed the window and isolated the roaring sea breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation on the recently sleepy island has become more and more unfavorable to myself. Since Tilly’s "Sleeping Curse", the non-combat witches have stood upside down. On her side, and it turns out that the demand for the auxiliary witches by the fjords is indeed far greater than that of the fighting witches. After all, there are not many foreign enemies in this place. The Chamber of Commerce hires witches mainly for commercial use or to open waterways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the status of this group of unconstrained guys has risen steadily, and there has been a tendency to compete with the fighting witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also mortals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, why didn’t you think about it at the beginning, Heti hated to think that there were only two factions on the island, as long as she always represented If the fighting witch speaks, it will not be weaker than Tilly. The number of ordinary islanders who have migrated to this place is increasing now, and the influence gradually becomes three factions. The latter is influenced by the Chamber of Commerce, and almost only recognizes Tilly. This can be seen from the fact that she will leave the island once and for all. - Especially after receiving the support of the Thunder, she has become a VIP of other islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the thought of this, she will have a nameless fire in her heart. What is good relationship with ordinary people and promote integration? This is to strengthen their own power. The trick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly has deceived everyone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is selling a little home belonging to the witch to ordinary people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to such a situation, I can never replace Tilly Wimbledon. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty is still the first time to take a 20-year-old Huang Maotou, and the feeling of wanting to win the battle witch to leave the island is getting stronger. Just when she was going to go to the sleepy island housekeeper Camilla to ask about the situation, when the Qumeimei could run to the west again, the door was suddenly pushed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, not good!" Tian Yan rushed in and said with an anxious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the longest and most capable person to follow her, Tian Yan is very Less revealing such a flustered look, which made Herti feel a little strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new witch came to sleep on the island, and she heard that her name is Annie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about that?" Hetty did not understand. Since the news of the merchants going to sleep on the island, there are occasional wandering wild witches coming to the door, which is really not a rare thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She came from the wolf!" Tian Yan lowered his voice, "I have seen her!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a thunder in the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty’s heart could not help but tremble, and soon realized what the “bad” in the other party meant. “You mean... she is blood The loser who refused the tooth? This is impossible! Will it be just the same name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought so at first, so I hid it in the crowd. At a glance, although she was carried to the palace, the appearance was very similar to Anne a few years ago!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
