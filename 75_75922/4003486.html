			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you already... extract the stone of the sage?" asked Achille. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sound in the hall for a while - this is probably the answer everyone wants to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stone of the Sage is the culmination of alchemy in rumors, it has the ability to transform everything, and it is why alchemy is called the scholarship of the sage. When used as a medium, it can turn ordinary iron and lead into precious metals, and people have a wealth of inexhaustible wealth. This is the origin of the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A stone that transforms everything...that thing is nothing more than an ancient alchemist who wants to be lazy to make up a thing," Kemo waved, "I want to show What you are watching is the mystery of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw him take a strange crystal glass tube from his pocket and show it generously in front of the alchemists. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has stretched his neck, and Lighten is no exception. The tube was about two fingers thick, and both ends were sealed. The tube contained some brown-red powder, which was unpretentious. It looked like dry soil and didn't know how to fill it in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Cayman took a cup of clean water and picked up a piece of green vermiculite from the table and smashed the end of the glass tube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a commotion in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Lightning has a big heartache, the transparent and flawless color is clearly a good crystal glass, and I want to burn it into such a well-balanced tube, I don’t know. It takes a lot of effort from the craftsman, and the other party actually opened the pipe directly. However, this also made him realize that the four princes previously said that the crystal glass has been developed in the territory is not a lie - the Wangdu Alchemy Association will never produce such a strange container. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water was quickly sent up, and Kemer poured the powder from the tube into the cup, the water slowly turned yellow-green, and the powder disappeared. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have a lead bar here," he turned and said, "Take two of the best quality."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Rayleigh said. "Since it is an alchemy reaction, who is going to do the same? I have seen some street performers who are very good at the obstacles and can be seen in full view. I changed the copper eagle into a golden dragon... I am not suspicious of you, but in this case, it is better to be careful," he looked at the other two chiefs. "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true," Achille said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrighten hesitated, anyone can see that Rayleigh is clearly suspected, and it is a bit rude to compare the other to a street performer, but this time He must stand on the side of the Alchemy Association. "I also... agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that the chief alchemist in Bianbu Town would be furious but did not expect Camo Spoel just smiled. "Of course, the last step is done by the alchemist and the apprentices. As I said, the essence of alchemy is simple, orderly, and sturdy. You Who is coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me come," Lightning felt his heart beat so badly that he didn't even dare to look at Kemo, but he could face the stone. The golden age of the surgery can not resist the temptation of curiosity - can this cup of yellow-green liquid really make lead into gold? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apprentice quickly took the material, which was a re-extracted lead stick with a blue-white appearance, usually placed in a wooden box with cotton. It is the best quality inventory. Lightning picked up one and carefully placed it in the cup, and then surprised to find that the surface of the lead stick showed a golden touch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt his hands tremble uncontrollably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look! It seems that something has grown!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden... God, it's golden!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is gold?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's also possible It’s copper!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
