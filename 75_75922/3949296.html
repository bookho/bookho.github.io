			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushing open the thick wooden door of the secret room, the scent of the scent of the sedge is coming, and the Archbishop Mayn likes the candle mixed with herbs and spices. Especially in the confined space without windows, the smell it exudes makes him feel calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is small, only the next round table and four chairs can be placed. The other two archbishops have already sat in their seats, and they are facing each other. The first door of the wooden door is still empty. The physical condition of the pope has gone from bad to worse, and it has not appeared in front of everyone for almost half a year. Only when you encounter a difficult problem that is difficult to solve, will you go to the secluded area of ​​the Hermes institution and ask the Pope for the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we are all together, let's get started." Mayn plugged in the door and sat between the two. "Tefren, the winter kingdom How is the order maintained?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the nobles of the kingdom, the rebels in other places are very small, and civilians even welcome us to take over the kingdom." Teflon touched With a beard, "Of course, those nobles who hold the past glory and obsessed with the end will be eradicated one by one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's good," Heather I licked my lips. "If you give me a trial, the people will have a deeper understanding of their ugly and dirty side. Unfortunately, I still have a lot of things to do here, and I can't go to the Yongdongwangcheng."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean directly ignored her words and said to Teflon: "The empty positions, our people should fill in as soon as possible. The church has cultivated a large number of talents, now It is the moment of use. Yongdong is the most influential kingdom of the church, and the smaller the waves, the more we can Empty to deal with the wolf heart and the morning light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is natural."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Going to the wall of the church - I mean the nobility, what should I do?" Heather asked, "The reason why the church can attract so many good believers is that we don't ask the blood, just look at the ability. If you accept the idiots rashly But it will shake the foundation of the church. My advice is..." She made a gesture of wiping her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before letting go, wait until the situation in the kingdom is stable, then pick them up, so that you can reduce the resistance to change." On this point, Mayn specifically asked After the pope, "the church can provide the same authority as their title, but it must not be inherited to future generations. Don't forget that we are going to destroy the king's power after all, without rushing for a moment, Heather."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather was born poor and suffered from hunger and wandering before being taken over by the church. But with her natural keen mind and extraordinary judgment, she has stepped into the position of today. Mayn can understand her dislike of the nobility, but this time we must focus on the overall situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the situation at the Grey Fort?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Intelligence said that the new king Tiefco did not return to the king after the failure, but went directly to the east." Tafren replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smart choice," Heather snapped a finger. "Take the Duke of Fran to challenge the Queen of the Waters. After the Duke died, he immediately went to the East to divide him. The territory to stabilize the military, and by the way, draw other aristocrats, oh... not all fools in the royal family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we can save a lot of money Heart, let the high priest of the Greyhall King's Church contact him. Presumably, under this predicament, he will not refuse the bait thrown by the church. The supply of drugs in the clear water port will be reduced by 30%, balancing the balance between the two. Strength. This is handed over to you, Master Teflon.” Mayn arranged, “As long as two years, the entire Grey Fort will have no soldiers available.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Reassure," Tefron nodded. "But... the long song in the west of the Grey Fort has a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What problem? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The four princes Roland returned to Bentham after defeating the Duke of Lane. The invitation from Taylor was not Get a response, does he really has no intention to compete for the throne "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"?? Ah ...... how do you see "Mayne look to Heather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter shrugged: "What else can you look at... What was the rumor about him at first? Nothing to learn, bad character, incompetence, greed. I don't think anyone like this can capture the long song fortress? So the answer is simple. He deceives everyone, be it nobles or us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
