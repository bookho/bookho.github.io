			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do Dortmund and Somme mention this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time there was a serious riot in Silver City, and several successive mine disasters caused hundreds of absenteeism to die, and employers were only willing to compensate for free losses, for those The invisible attitude of the low-income displaced people has provoked the anger of the families of the victims. Residents who did not want to wait for death came out from the mining area, burned and looted all the way, and finally relied on the suppression of the Knights of the Kings to restore order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parents did not return for the long time, until the two brothers and sisters were sent to the old Graham home, the nightingale heard the death of the parents from the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the meaning of the viscount is not the same thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not expect an accident that had been more than a decade old, and there was still the possibility of subversion. If, as the other party said, the investigation is no longer just a relationship between Hyde and the Somi family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale sneaked out of the room, through the slabs, to the ground floor, and then began to carry the listening notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was originally prepared to let Roland call her back at any time, but I didn’t expect it to come in handy in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's really suspicious," Roland, who was at the end of the remarks, replied after listening to the story. "So you have to stay longer in the mansion?" Br,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I want to wait until the evening, ask Hyde to ask him... He may know something." The nightingale hesitated, "Sorry, Your Majesty, I... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing to apologize," Roland quickly interrupted her. "I will wait for you in the camp before you investigate. Rest assured, It's very safe here. As long as I don't go out, it's not a violation of the agreement. But you should pay attention to your own safety, don't be too impulsive, report it to me every two hours, no matter what the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale has a warmth in her heart. She silenced for a little while before she whispered. "Yes, I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight disappeared until the skylight disappeared, and the nightingale left the cellar and walked toward the room where Hyde was - here Before, she had confirmed the location where his brother. The moon sinking means that time is close to three o'clock in the middle of the night, most people have fallen asleep, even the guards of the vigil, it is inevitable to sleep, so it is the best time for her action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyde’s bedroom is located on the first floor of the mansion, close to the back garden. Generally only servants and less important guests will be placed here. From the side confirmed the words of the two guards - Dotce did not regard the successor of the Gram family too much, but also let the night owl realize that the friendliness of the childhood beauty is probably disguised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the attitude of the other person’s contempt makes her a lot easier, and there is no one in the entire hall to the aisle, so that even if something happens, she will have enough time. Get away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the bedroom, the nightingale straightened the younger brother out of the quilt. When he woke up from his dream, he had not completely recovered. The dagger with the cold light has already reached his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Screaming, asking for help, crying will die, understand?" She stood behind Hyde and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter hurriedly nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, now turn around and see who I am?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyde It’s a snapshot, but when he looks at the face of the person through the faint moonlight, his eyes are suddenly widened! If it weren't for the dagger on his neck, he would almost scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he finally managed to hold back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that the other party’s mood has stabilized, the nightingale slowly recovered the dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...what is it here?" Hyde said, suppressing the trembling voice, "Don't you die early?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the person in front of her, tearing away her most vulnerable side and exposing it to the outsiders who are not at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you say that?" She bit her tongue and let the rust smell dispel the thoughts in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because, because..." Hyde swallowed, "Tefco rummaged the king and the surrounding cities several times and declared that all witches I have been executed by him. No, but, Veronica, I mean, my sister... I didn’t want you to die. I was shocked when I heard the news, and thought if you didn’t leave, maybe There will be nothing wrong with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veronica...She hasn’t heard of this name for a long time, but she’s no longer like It was so easy to believe in each other before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of string-like jitter has already told her the answer - the latter half is full of lies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you get along with Dortmund Somali?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hey, this..." He was slightly stagnation. "After the death of Old Gülen, the family often clashed constantly. I don't know the specifics. I only know that when I inherit the title, there is almost no savings in the house. At this time, the Viscount was found on the door, and I had no choice." [Lie]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He forced you to merge into Somé ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, he said that if I don't promise, I will get rid of me..." [Lie]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing for him now?" The nightingale is quiet, "Relief the poor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Hyde gnawed the tooth "He just used me to be a scorpion. It was actually selling dream water! The mice that transported the goods for him were mixed in the crowd. I also discovered his tricks recently!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first half of the magic has no anti- Yes, but the latter half is still a lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale found that he was not angry, and even quite relaxed... Yes, it is this feeling, this is the state that should be in normal conversation. The lie is constant, the truth is mixed... The heart is always changing, even if the blood is connected, you can't hear the true heart of the other person. Since her ability has awakened, she has long been accustomed to such a situation, whether it is to face the lie without changing color, or to strip the truth from the layer of scam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Roland’s conversation that rarely detects the magical beat, which makes her difficult to adapt for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, the shadow killer lurking in the darkness and tremble the aristocrats in the central region is back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are your plans for the next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Hyde suddenly flutters Falling to the ground, screaming and pleading, "Sister, please help me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help you?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He climbed two steps forward. "I know that I was not good before... but I am your younger brother! The Viscountess did not treat me as a nobleman, you saw it, he actually Bring the servant's house to me, and repair the house just to hide the eyes and ears, continue to stay here, he will start to me one day sooner or later!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So you want me to take you away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go? Isn't there nothing left?" Hyde shook his head in panic, then hate Tao, "Is Gloria killing you? Although I don't know what ability to use, you can easily enter here and you will be able to enter his bedroom. Sister, kill him! As long as he dies, I Have the opportunity to become The real Somalia nobility! Then, then you kill the other heirs one by one, this territory...and all the Somalia industries are owned by us!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night eyes stared at his eyes, and for a long time did not answer, until Hyde lowered his head again and again, she began to say, "Before that, I want to ask you a question first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes..." The younger brother responded quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
