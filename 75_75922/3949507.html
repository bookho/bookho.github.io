			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... Is this a high-level awakening?" asked the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha didn’t know what to say for a while, there was only one thought left in her head – why? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City was forgotten, the Federation was destroyed, and it is reasonable to say that there is no special training and guidance, and the witch’s ability should be greatly retrogressed. But what did she see now? A young adult witch has already won two promotions. This is not a good luck to describe. It is known that even in a genius federation, there are only a handful of such witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if you didn’t get it wrong, are there three other people like Anna? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha stared at the gray-haired man, and it took a while to return to God. "This...should be it, but I have no balance." Magic Stone can't test the size of the ability change.” She paused and her throat was dry. “I want to ask, what happened to Anna when she was awakened? She seems to have just grown up, how can these two changes happen? In just one or two years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha said after she finished, she used the honorific words unconsciously - the witch could not Inheritance, even if a large number of ordinary people are entangled, there is no guarantee that a powerful witch will be born, so the high-level always decides the order by ability, not by life. According to Anna's current ability, she already has the qualification to enter the top of the federation. Compared with herself, even if she is not a superior, she is at least an equal person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any high-level awakened person is a worthy respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time was because the magic was exhausted against the evil beast, and the second time I thought it should be caused by learning knowledge."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowledge..." She groaned, "What kind of knowledge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, this can Let's talk about it later, "The prince clears his throat. "Now, come back to the topic we just talked about. What does Akaris's God's penalty test mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, if he didn't lie to himself, this knowledge must contain a very bad truth, so Anna can awaken new abilities through enlightenment. Before he did not gain trust, he was not willing to elaborate and it was normal. Ai Gesha can't help but feel excited. Increasing the chance of promotion is of great significance to the witch. If we can understand the principle, it is not difficult to re-revive the Federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, where did he come from? Here is a backward wild land, how can some villagers understand the magic of magic? She is full of confusion. In the four hundred years, what did the world look like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha temporarily moved these intractable problems to the side. "Akaris is extremely powerful, even after wearing the stone of punishment, even if faced with several The Lord of Hell does not fall into the wind. However, there is really too little supernatural. Or... We are lost in the diversity of abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sex?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, a witch does not know what kind of abilities she can have before she wakes up, but according to the statistics of the federation, 10% of witches Only 10% is suitable for combat - the same proportion applies to the extraordinary. And in this battle witch, how many people can be promoted is not fixed. The Federation has not appeared for 50 years. The embarrassing situation of the promotion, so the witch’s combat ability is very unstable.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The mortal may not be able to wake up, the awakening may not be able to fight, the battle may not be able to It is strong, is this what it means?" The prince fumbled for the chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s almost like this," Aegusa sighed. "So we formed a Guardian-made Guard to make up for the Witch's deficiencies, but... mortal Can't defeat the devil. Even if they are given the stone of God's punishment, it is far from enough to compete with the insane madness. In this unfavorable situation, Akaris ordered the Quest to learn to start a warrior who can break through the limits of the human body. Looking at this scribbled note, she seems to be successful..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems?" The prince curiously said, "You don't say that you are the first one." Are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
