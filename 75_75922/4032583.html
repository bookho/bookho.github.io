			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are piercing roars everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo can only hear the screams and screams in the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front is a shield composed of a sacred warrior, followed by a slowly advancing Judgement - this was originally designed to deal with the formation of the evil beast cluster impact, However, the giant shield is equally effective for bows and muskets. A thick iron shield is enough to block the powerful smashing, and the rifle of Tipho's imitation can't penetrate it. The only drawback is that it is too heavy. Only the gods can carry it on the march. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it has failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From time to time, there are gods and warriors who are screaming and screaming into two pieces, and even those behind them are also smashed, and the broken mouth is very There will be a bloody fog, and the warrior who is not killed on the spot will hold his own internal organs or pains in his hands and feet, and continue to wear the war of the same robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This will not work, let God punished the charge!" the deputy shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Soli," another commander clenched his fists. "The iron ball can only go straight, the hit is not fast, spread out." It’s the right thing to do, we can’t be the target anymore!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I know, pass my orders, spread the formation, all the charge!” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo heard Soli Dahl issued an offensive order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this moment, a new weapon has joined the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like a raindrop that never stops, and like the humming of King Ge’s screaming - the front of the front line is covered with smoke, the charge The warriors fell to the ground like wheat, and she couldn't even see where the attack came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commanders’ faces turned pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that this battle has been decided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there was a squeaking sound of the air that was cut through the ear, and it was sharp and concealed, like a poisonous snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her eyes to the direction of the sound, subconsciously want to avoid, but remembered that this body does not belong to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Soli Dahl is not as alert as she is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An iron ball fell from the air, squatting on the ground in front of him, and then leaped high and passed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo only felt the angle of view spinning, then fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood rushed from the shoulders of Soli, and the position where the arm was originally was empty. He clenched his teeth and didn’t make himself cry out. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around me hurried around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Bishop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, God bless, your hand..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retreat, let them all fall back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring up Soli to leave first Here, I am coming off!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall to this interruption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo opened his eyes, and the deep stone prism and the secret temple in the depths of the earth returned to her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out to be the case, she bowed her head and couldn’t help but open her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So everything makes sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continuous roaring, the smell of smoke floating on the scene... all prove that they are all a new type of firearms - the snow powder tube of the Tefco imitation, even the fur of the other side can not touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not “visually witnessed,” Jielu couldn’t imagine that the snowflake weapon could have such a huge power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She certainly wouldn’t believe that this is the secret of the Wimbledon family, otherwise it would be impossible for Tiefco and Garcia to know nothing about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that Roland encountered something in Bianbu Town that he has achieved today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it is a seclusion family that has mastered ancient secrets. Since the dissolution of the Federation, some builders who have helped the locals have lost contact forever, and there are many skilled craftsmen. It is not impossible to honing these delicate devices. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or or in somewhere in the ruins of the desolate mountains - the history books in the library mention that there are some strange ruins on the edge of the wild land. The reason for the final split of the federation is also due to the existence of a labyrinth of underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she is more inclined to be the power of a witch, so that ordinary snow powder has extremely deadly power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, the four princes will change their previous attitudes, recruiting witches and helping them clean up their grievances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But your own guess is not important... Whatever the reason, Roland Wimbledon must be clear about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as they can swallow Roland, the ins and outs of these weapons will surely be mastered by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jie Luo...Adult?" The guard captain who was at the exit of the cage saw her delay and could not help but worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo pressed down the passion of the heart until the raised corner of his mouth was completely calm, and slowly walked out of the cage. "I am fine, inform the intelligence agency, call They called back the pure people who were still in the morning kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All?" The captain shouted, "You can make a plan..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The decisive battle is about to begin," said Jerry, word by word. "I want to see everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the situation in the morning is negligible compared to the things in Roland’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power is huge, the range is amazing, the mortal is available, just think about it, you can understand its meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the weapon can be assembled on a large scale before the arrival of the Red Moon, the victory rate of the Holy City against the devil will increase dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she can get closer to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Gray Fort North, Glen Valley Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Iphi returned to the castle bedroom and could not help but yawn. In the past two months, in addition to performing the tooth extraction operation, she did not idle after arriving in the town. First, she helped the First Army to prepare the camp. Then she followed Itis and others to the Hanfengling to transfer the local residents. Although it was very busy, it was very busy. It’s quite fulfilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mood calms down, she is now a non-combat witch who has her own unique flash point, and even if she doesn’t talk about her ability, she is more common with most There is no difference between people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the daily life, she was also accepted by the Witch Alliance a little bit, even when performing the alert task, Mai Hao also beat her to the ground. Say hello - although the lightning around her looks unpleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iphie did not send a message to the other side to forgive herself, but intended to use actions to make up for the mistakes made in the past, she did not even care if she could eventually become their mouth. Sisters, all they do is for atonement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymous to her only friend, Anne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
