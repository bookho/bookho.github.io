			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North slope mine, firing room backyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale picked up the glass of wine on the table and raised it over his head. The crystal clear cup shimmers in the light, and no variegated color can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that this cup is called a crystal cup, and the firing process and recipes have always been the top secret information of the royal alchemy workshop. This goblet in the hands of the light is worth about a golden dragon. Crystal glassware with exquisite silver cutlery has always been a favorite of big nobility and wealthy businessmen to show off their financial resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays, these crystal containers brought from the palace will soon be turned into raw materials for smelting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Highness, you are not burning a cup, it is a golden dragon." The nightingale exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have time to study how to burn sand into colorless glass, so I have to do it in this way." Roland throws a beautifully shaped crystal pot Into the black fire of Anna's dingding--the nightingale remembers that the prince used it to hold the ale, and filled the cups with the sisters in the afternoon tea and the demon's moon celebration in the castle garden. I couldn't help but feel a pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At stable high temperatures, the pot softens quickly and then turns into a viscous paste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Using sand...burning glass?" Anna asked, "Is they the same substance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Well, the main ingredients are similar, but the sand contains a lot of impurities, the burnt glass is mostly brown and green, can not meet the requirements of use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So, is glass pure sand?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smiled. “You can think so. When I write this part of the book into a book, you will read it again. Understand how those small balls make up the substance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, I won't understand... the night licks, and again, the glass of different colors does not affect it. The function of the container, anyway, you are not using it as a water cup, why do you have to use a transparent crystal cup to burn. She walked over to Anna and looked at the glassware that had been recast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they still look colorless and transparent, the appearance is far from the previous crystal cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some look like tubes, the bottom is round, thin and long. Some are like bottles, and the bottom is as big as a kettle. There is only a bottle of thumb on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strangest thing is a tube that is bent into a horseshoe shape. There are no seals on either side, and it is impossible to do even the container. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do with these crystal glassware?" Nightingale couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not for me, it is for the alchemists in Bianbu Town," Roland stirred the mucus in the black fire with a glass rod. "They can use these." Utensils to extract some acids and bases, the chemicals needed to produce new weapons for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acid? Alkali? Chemicals? At night, I blinked and found that I couldn’t understand what my Highness was saying. This feeling made her a little depressed. But if I had to ask one by one, it seemed too ignorant. She didn't want to expose this face in front of Anna, so she had to focus on the only vocabulary that she could understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the alchemist in the town? Even if it is a long song fortress, there is no alchemy workshop. You can only find the alchemist in Chishui City, and I heard that their salary is higher than the lord minister. It is very difficult for them to recruit them by Golden Dragon alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know a lot," Roland responded with a smile. "This is indeed true. The people I sent are already on the way to Chishui City. I will get news in about two weeks. But I am not recruiting them with Jinlong, but some alchemy. Secret. As for whether I can be recruited or not, I have to try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first half of His Royal Highness praised the sorrow of the nightingale, she was satisfied Returning to the center of the yard, pinch a group of cakes placed on the round table into the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
