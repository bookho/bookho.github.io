			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean stood at the top of the Tongtian Tower and looked through the window to the city of Hermes, which was covered in silver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last group of evil beasts attacked the new holy city, the icefield has temporarily calmed down, and the snow has weakened a lot. Urban residents have ushered in A rare leisure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days should be a day to celebrate, but Mayn’s heart is still empty. In order to kill those terrible giant mixed species, a team of gods and warriors rushed out of the city wall from the side door and resisted them. In the end, 19 people were injured and two died. After the two beasts were cut off from the limbs, they snarled on the ground for a long time, and finally the guards on the walls killed them with spears. However, compared with the loss of the gods, the fear of what he fears is the time node represented by the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a long time, he sighed and sighed, sat back to the table, wanted to open the holy book again, and read it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just turned it over and the results will not change," Tefron happened to be carrying two hot drinks into the ring hall, he will A cup was pushed to the front of Mayn. "Isn't you still promised to see you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have made a request to the Privy Council for the third time. "But there is still no response," Mayn said with anxiety. "I don't know what it is, what is the key moment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't worry," Teflon interrupted him. "You said that the Holy Scriptures were written by the first pope. It is inevitable that mistakes will occur. After four hundred years, who can guarantee everything? Right?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, this is not the same," the Archbishop shook his head. "If the time is wrong, it will be a disaster for us!" Now we have invested a lot of strength and energy to unify the kingdom, in order to gather the power of the whole continent to fight against the devil, but if the time is cut in half, we can't accumulate so many gods in the war! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet, Mayn," the old bishop smiled and he slowly sipped hot drink. "The facts have already happened. Hell fangs appear in us." No one can change in front of him. But there may be two reasons for this. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the reason? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to take a bite before I say," he touched his beard.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean Picking up the cup, it looks like a cup of goat's milk, close enough, but there is a scent of fragrance into the nose, "What is inside? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Winter," Teflon tilted his mouth. "Although you can't drink dream water directly, it's good to come here. It can at least help." You relieve tension, and you can help sleep. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean sipped her goat's milk and sent a burning sensation in her throat, although the mellowness of goat's milk dilute the stimulation of winter flower juice, but for He didn't often drink this kind of drink. He still couldn't get used to it. He coughed twice and he wiped his mouth. "Even if it is a dream water, I can't let me fall asleep at this moment. Can you tell me now? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One may be that the Pope is wrong. For an old man, there are often dizziness and memory mistakes. Deep experience. "Tefren shrugged.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's unlikely," Mayn frowned. "It's about the layout and arrangement of the church, and even the destiny of mankind." He must be careful and careful to write these things. The second point? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The second case is that everything has changed because of some unknown situation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop waited for a moment and saw that the other party did not continue to say it. He said, "So? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's it. He repeated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...what a joke, everything has changed?" For this reason, all our efforts will be paid! Why can you understate it--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May Daren! "Tefron's voice suddenly increased by a few degrees. "What are you urging, a road that will surely defeat the devil?" Still think that only you want to hold Hermes, keep the devil's footsteps outside the ice sheet? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
