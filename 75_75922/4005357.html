			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let her go!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several sounds sounded at the same time, Ifeah grinned, raised his right hand, the cage suddenly disappeared, and Mai Mai fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You bastard!" A golden figure vacated and rushed straight towards her - it was lightning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the little girl’s fist had just been lifted up, and she was trapped by the magical cage. The distance between the two sides was less than one arm, but she could not touch each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of here, there is nothing for you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yi Fei is unwilling to hold the cage Pulling out, the lightning followed the cage and rolled a few laps on the ground until it was out of the ability to escape from the disappearing cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning wiped the dust on his face, ready to rush again, but saw Roland walked to Effie and raised his hand high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sigh of thought, everyone is in the same place . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ifeiu was surprised that she did not go to the red cheeks on the half, but looked up at Roland’s eyes, as if she could not understand his actions. . After a moment, she slowly fell down on one knee. "I am rude, kneel down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is also somewhat surprised, he would not want to The woman started, but when she saw that Mai was down on the ground, she didn’t even think about it, and the body acted. Looking back now, there was a feeling of ignoring my daughter being bullied by other people’s bears and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean by this?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, the power that a person can explode in a critical moment is far better than usual, I just want to make the test results more accurate..." Iphi's The tone is extremely calm, as if it is a trivial matter. "It seems that advanced non-combat witches are no different. The evolution of ability can't make up for its own gap."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can't help but be dumbfounded. What kind of environment does this person live in, and feel that it is natural to hurt a person for testing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is McMug?" He looked at Wendy, who had already brought back the original white-haired girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately... it didn't hurt too much, just a little red," Wendy frowned and picked up her sleeves. The white arms were clearly visible. I saw a red seal left by the cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕..." McMug buried his head in Wendy's arms, his voice was wronged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, Your Majesty," Iphie said dismissively. "I have a lot of strength in contraction. This kind of minor injury will be a day or two for the witch." Self-healing -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apologize to her!" Roland interrupted violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter opened his mouth and looked at him strangely, his face instantly rising red, "Sorry, Your Majesty--"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not me, is McMug."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time she bit her teeth and bowed her head, no longer snoring. Looking at Iphia’s look that she would never apologize to the other, she almost laughed at Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the atmosphere of the sleeping island may be worse than he imagined. The group of bloody people will go to the territory of the worldly lord, put in the witch. The main sleeping island, I am afraid that I will be dissatisfied with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the most important thing is that the parties think that their approach is no problem, if it is simply punishment, Roland can come up with countless ways to make her suffer, but That would not help to reverse the three views of her deviation. When he thought of Tilly’s purpose of sending them here, he couldn’t help but sigh. Since he had slaped his chest and praised Haikou, who had “who had trouble to come to his brother”, it’s natural not to just toss her up. It’s a matter of throwing it back. If you can't help Tilly to calm the contradictions in the back, Sleep Island will fall apart sooner or later - of course, you may be able to attract some witches, but you will lose Tilly's trust forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think that you are stronger than others, you can ignore the feelings of the weak?" Roland's voice is getting colder, "In fact, you are the real weak!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence allows the other party to react in an instant, and Effie suddenly raised his head and looked dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You think that the fighting witch should be above the auxiliary witch, it is in the face of foreign enemies, the fighting witch is the core to ensure the group continues, right? He went on to say, "This kind of thought is pitiful and ridiculous. You really have to start, and you are overwhelmed by your ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her brow Closely, the eyes are exposed to dangerous light. "Your Majesty, you want to say, can non-combat witches beat me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, you don't believe it... ..." Roland sneered, "Most people in the Witch Alliance can do this easily, even if they have never used the ability to fight." Here, he turned his eyes to the side of the lightning, and the latter was a glimpse, then He quickly realized his meaning and nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just your dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then let McMug and you be serious Let's compete," he said quietly. "She will tell you personally that you are not qualified to override any witches!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What?” Ifeh widened her eyes. “You mean... with that stupid pigeon?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The showdown is set for tomorrow,” said Roland One sentence said, "You will naturally understand that you are not as powerful as you think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;************* ******<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the room, lunch is already on the living room table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dishes are filled with broth, bread, mushrooms and stewed greens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, they don’t have to go to the lobby today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh? Is there meat and bread?" Yu Yu was surprised. "I thought I could only drink cold water to hunger today."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this not wanting me to go to a duel with a hungry stomach," Iphie smirked. "He really believes in the stupid bird."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, there is a drug in it, such as the one that makes people diarrhea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iphie does not care Grab a piece of bread and put it in your mouth. "You can't eat it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The duel is not me," Yu Yu rolled his eyes and climbed. On the stool, drag a plate of roasted mushrooms to the front. "In other words, do you really need to do this? Heti is letting us confirm that the situation is correct, but I didn't ask you to be in the presence of the lord." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a rare opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Interesting, "not for other reasons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iphie turned his head and stared at Yu Yu coldly until the latter retracted his head. "Well, when I didn't ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the witches who went to the West returned to the island, the atmosphere on the island became more and more detrimental to the blood. I heard that the brother of Tilly’s elders built a territory for the witch’s body across the sea, and also treated the non-combat witches who were uncomfortable with the power of the chickens. This made the incompetent generations on the island increasingly louder. Master Hert suspects that this is the message Tilly deliberately created to win the majority of supporters. After all, according to common sense, the witch who can fight for the lord and win the land and power is more valued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today’s temptations surprised her, and this secular lord seems to be treating all witches equally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the most unexpected for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The most unexpected is Mai Mai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
