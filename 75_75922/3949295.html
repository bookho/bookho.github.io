			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This half-month is the same as the festival, even if you stand on the terrace at the top of the lord's tower, Farion can feel the rising atmosphere in the city. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goods and population moved from the Eagle City have greatly expanded the strength of the port city, the looters have gained a lot, and the slave market has followed the crowd. . After experiencing this series of battles, the Black Sail Fleet not only did not have much loss, but instead made up a large number of slaves as sailors, and is currently in the midst of intense training in the port. A few days later, they will travel to the fjord route and begin the first plunder this year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Mausoleum also issued a slave development decree in due course, as long as these slaves from the Eagle City can capture new cadres in the looting as a substitute, they I can jump from a slave to a Bishui port. Presumably, with such an inspiring decree, the residents of the Eagle City who are slaves will also do their best to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Tefco has lost, there are no more people in the Greysburg Kingdom who can block the Queen of the Water. As long as it takes time, Garcia Wimbledon will inevitably become the master of the Grey Fort. Farion thought this way, but why is there not much happy look on the Queen's face, but there is a long shadow in the eyebrows? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"", the patriarch of the sandstone clan and the black bone clan seeks to see." The voice of the guards came from outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farion looked at him and saw the latter without any indication, then shouted: "Bring them in."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether you are resting, holding a meeting, or meeting someone who meets her, I like to do it at the top of this tower. As long as the weather is right, the terrace is the longest place in Garcia. Most people do not adapt to standing in the air, facing the slightly scent of the sea breeze. The sand people are no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriarch of the sandstone clan is a petite woman and a goddess in the family. When Farion first heard this introduction, he sneered at the bottom of his heart. What a goddess, but a fallen witch. The patriarch of the Black Bone clan grows tall and big, his face is covered with scars, and his arms are thick and thick. Every time there are meetings, there will be three to four guards around him, in case he is not competing against Her Majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the two patriarchs wrinkled their eyebrows on the terrace, but they quickly converge and bow down to the clear water queen. May you have an oasis in front of you, and the stars in the sky will shine on your path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up," Garcia sat down against the guardrail, "How? Are the new residences satisfied?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything is fine," said the goddess Kabbah, "there is a forest with water in the territory, and iron sand over the sand." The city is much more comfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's fine. What are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Your Majesty, the last time you gave -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black bones were interrupted by Kabbah when they just opened their mouths. "It is like this, kneel down. After the battle, many warriors showed signs of weakness and wilting. Only by regularly taking new pills can they get better, but the pills in our hands are not much. I am here. You paid more pills to our "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;". I also mean the "black bone stared goddess look, muffled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The material for this thing is very complicated. I don't have much spare time now. Don't worry, I will send it to you as soon as possible after the new batch of pills is made. Don't forget to prepare Golden Dragon. If it is not enough, you can use the water of the river to pay the bill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I will take the liberty to ask," Barbie hesitated for a moment, "I don't know when the next batch will be made?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't tell you this," Garcia yelled. The hair that is blown up by the sea breeze, "All the news about the pill is a secret. Go back and wait patiently. Those warriors are just wilting, and it is not a problem if you rest more."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards got the hint of Farion and walked up to encircle the sand people, and they would "take" the two more questions about Kabbah and the black bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farion rarely heard that Her Majesty would make such a voice. He volunteered: "Your Majesty, do you think it is inappropriate to give the land of the southern border to the sand people? If they have a strong day..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Farin," Garcia shook her head. "I have never worried about the sand people. They don't pose any threat to the clear water port. That land. The lake is just in the middle of the two clan sites, and the upstream passes through the clear water port. As long as I block half of the river, the reduced water will let them fight for themselves. The reason why I choose sandstone and black bones is Here - their relationship has always been less harmonious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you worried about the pill problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia did not answer, just then, the guards knocked on the door again: "Your Majesty, the church priest Dikar asks for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take him Come in," the Queen stood up immediately, her face getting darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jiasia. Wimbledon, I am asking you on behalf of the Holy City," the priest climbed onto the terrace and squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pills? Why are the first few batches delivered normally, but these batches are late?" Garcia asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wrath of sorrow, I am coming for this matter," Dikar wiped the sweat from his forehead. "The quantity you ask to buy 5,000 is too More, even if Hermes is fully committed, there is no way to meet your needs in a short time, this time I brought back a new batch -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much?" Garcia interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One thousand." Deca said, "The back will be sent back and forth."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And how did you promise before?" Her face looked a little better. "How much is there. Where is the pill, I send someone to take it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the church, I don't know Jinlong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Golden Dragon I won't miss you one," Garcia walked In front of Dika, he said in his ear, "But if the pills in the back are too late, your head will be hung on the corner of the flagship of the black sail. I think the Archbishop will not drop a tear for you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the priest retired palely, she returned to the railing and looked at the distant sea antenna. The sea breeze lifted her long gray hair, like the flag fluttering on the fleet mast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right, I am worried about the problem of pills." Garcia's voice seems to be very far away, "If Tiffco is two months later." My preparations will be more complete, and I will be able to defeat his Knights of the Knights without relying on pills. Unfortunately, he came too fast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have It’s done very well.” Farion thought, who else can do better? From occupying the Eagle City, she formulated a response plan, ordered people to take away materials and residents, and at the same time excavated ditches in the city and poured black water. In the absence of manpower, the wilderness of the Southland was exchanged for the support of the Saudis, and the clan warriors who took the pills were attacked by the Knights from both sides. Her loyal supporters fought against the last wave of the sea. Did not hesitate to swallow the secret medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The secret medicine provided by the church is not as bad as life as I said. If you don't get it later, the drug will become mad. And then die in weakness, pain and limb atrophy. I don't care about the life of the sand people, but the people who work for me should get the best return." She paused, "Farian, you take people to take Return the pills and distribute them to the heroic warriors. Let them eat in half and keep them for a little longer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Be sure to follow your wishes "Your Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Faryon was preparing to retire, the third time outside the door, the shouts of the guards were heard. "His Royal Highness, there is a letter from the king." Secret letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Read and go," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Farion took the secret letter and skillfully cut the seal and took out the stationery. Most of these secret letters are information sent back from the eyeliners of various places. There is no signature, no recipients, and the content is usually as concise as possible. But when he saw the first sentence, the whole person suddenly stood still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
