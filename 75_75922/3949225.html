			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice and rain are flying, diluting the bloodyness in the Holy City, Elei Ya was stationed in a big sword and gasped fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not the first time to participate in the Hermes defense line, but she never thought that the new holy city may also have a lost day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall is completely finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleania has never seen such a terrible monster, huge insect-type mixed beasts are pulled out from the ground, the body is attached to the glacier cliffs, and the bones are clawed. If the barb is generally embedded in the wall, step by step up the top of the wall, and its body is not completely exposed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just a big body, but everyone didn’t expect it, the monster actually opened his mouth and spit out a lot of mixed evils from his mouth. The beast, the wall suddenly exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The originally well-organized team was attacked by the evil beasts, and the trial army’s advance camp was also split. She watched as one of her comrades was swallowed up by the evil beast, but she could do nothing. The warm human blood mixes with the black blood of the monsters, flowing along the cracks on the slate floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the horn of the retreat, the trebuchet placed in the holy city was also started, and the granite blocks of half a person descended from the sky, completely ignoring the city. Many people and the king team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleania only remembers that a boulder happened to slam the captain of Dikatto who guarded his side. After he climbed up from the ground, he saw that he had Together with the armor, it is embedded in a cracked slate, the body is like a piece of parchment full of folds, the intestines are pulled out from the cracks in the abdomen, and the blood of the hot air is integrated under him with a small otter. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not jumping before the stone falls, I am afraid that the end will be like him, she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how to get out of the wall and retreat to the wall, Eleania has not remembered it. There are screams and curses everywhere, everyone is wielding weapons and slashing, and they don’t know whether they are fighting the evil spirits or killing them with their companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A team of more than 100 judges, only 12 of them, including themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do next, Captain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain Alleia!"<埃尔 /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleania has come back to God, yes, according to the rules of the trial army, if the captain is killed in the battle, the vice captain should take over the captain. Position, lead the team to continue to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clenched her lips until a sizzling taste filled her mouth. "We go to the north gate of the Holy City, and the evil beast wants to attack the new holy city. Pass there." This command means that the residential area between the city wall and the inner city is handed over, but she has no choice but no place more important than the church center, Hermes Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is still a sentence she did not say, the glacier cliffs can not stop this group of monsters, and the remaining eleven people can play What is the role? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps today is the day of her dedication to heaven. May you be kind, she prays in her heart, and shouts, "Judges will never give up! We are out!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Judges will never give up!" the other people shouted in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve people lined up as a column to sprint all the way to the North Gate. The killing sound of the city wall area gradually weakened and eventually disappeared into the wind and rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at the North Gate, Allexia saw a lot of trials gathered in front of the suspension bridge. It seems that everyone is thinking about the same thoughts, which makes She felt a little better in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in this crisis, the suspension bridge is laid down. Eleania frowned and walked up to a handsome warrior in the red dress of the presiding judge. He clenched his fist and said: "The judge is the grown-up, I am the captain of the fourth squad, Adriah Quinn! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
