			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash sits at the top of the castle, waiting for the duel day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, her persuasion has made no progress, and the stubbornness of the witches in the assisting society has greatly exceeded her expectations, whether it is an older book or not. Adult Lily has refused her invitation. The only difference is that the way to refuse is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some chose to stay because of Roland, and some did not want to leave the sisters of the Co-Help, resulting in ten witches like a piece of iron. As for Anna and Nanawa, who belonged to Bianbu Town, she didn’t even have the mood to try. Especially in the former, when the ashes stood in front of her, the magic felt was very different from the previous witches. The magic in Anna's body is like hard steel, smooth and dense, like an iron wall spanning between two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the many witches that Tilly called, no one ever gave her this feeling. As a result of inquiring to other witches, Anna’s ability is an unusual manipulation of the flames. Why the invisible flame in the magic makes her feel like a physical barrier, and the ash is puzzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for this town, it is also very different from the towns or villages that have been seen before. If you want to describe it, it is full of vitality, and people seem to have nothing to do every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can look at the panoramic view of the town from the top of the castle. The most densely populated areas in the town centre are building new houses. They have made the planned site a whole community. The houses in each community are similar. The carriage that transported the bricks from the north did not stop for a moment. The stonemasons first dug out ten similar pits and then started the brick construction. This construction was so fast that it was almost a day. A half-man high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking northeast, there is a thick smoke coming straight into the sky - not a fire in the forest, but a brick kiln at work. There are also a few particularly strong brick towers that are being erected, and they look like a red giant tree that has been cut down. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the riverside pier, several sailboats arrive in Bianbu Town every day. From the banner hanging on the mast, most of the sailboats come from the Long Song Fortress. The cargo unloaded from the ship almost filled the yard. Around the yard, there was a team of guards armed with wooden guns. Unlike most city garrison players, they don’t take a lazy walk for a while, or simply find a place to hide and sneak in, but they line up in a straight line, walking between the dock and the yard, sometimes Will also take the initiative to help unload the goods, which in the memory of the ashes, is a scene that has never been seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland. What kind of magic does Wimbledon have, so that these people can be so passionate about building a deserted and barren town? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a screaming bird on the top of the head, and the ashes looked up and saw a huge fat pigeon descending from the sky and falling on her. Shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I finally found you." The pigeon licked her cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tilly sent you?" Ashes took a handful of wheat from his pocket and threw it on the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pigeons fluttered and flew past, suddenly realized what they were, "I am not a bird!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then become a person to talk to me again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, oh," the voice just fell, the feathers of the pigeons suddenly expanded, white The light shines through the gaps in the feathers, and then a head is drilled out, and the inflated feathers shrink quickly, turning into a long white hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how many times you watch, Ashes will be amazed. Mai Mai, a witch who can change into a variety of birds, in addition to the body shape will be a big circle, other details are beautiful. Sometimes she even envied her ability. Compared to the extraordinary magic of not afraid of the stone of punishment, she is more eager to travel through the two places quickly. In that case, whenever I want to see Tilly, I can leave anytime and anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even with tracking marks, it’s not so easy to locate your direction," Mai said shaking his fluff. "Distance Far away, my magic stone statue can hardly feel the fluctuations of the prints. Fortunately, the shadows know your approximate destination, I have been flying over the Dragon Ridge, this statue has some reaction."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
