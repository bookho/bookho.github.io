			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Duke of Calvin walked into the Jade Forest, Itis was already in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My sister--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you?" She did not Resolutely interrupted, "I wrote a letter to you a month ago, to fully cooperate with the first army's assembly and preparation work, and their requirements should be as satisfying as possible."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open man’s arm suddenly stopped in the air. “I informed the Earl of Glen in Glentown and sent a butler to supervise the matter. Isn’t that all the effort?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Isis was holding her hands on her chest with dissatisfaction. "You will be able to show the sincerity of the North in your presence in the town, and it will be of great importance to the church." I don’t think too much.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But this is the territory of Earl of Haier after all—”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Please, father, nobles are gone. Are you still thinking about the vassal territory? I thought that after the "rebellion" of the Hors and Lista family, you will be a little more decisive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Calvin felt that his face could not be hanged. "I thought it was not seen for a few months. My daughter would at least give me a hug and burst into a miss." Instead of sitting down and talking about business. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said Itis, smirking. "I don't know who is thundering in the study, shouting this idiot daughter, it is simply eating and unfamiliar." Wolverine? If I guessed it right, you still want to pick something up, but you can't bear it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke can't help but swear, "I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, which is this bastard? Leaked out!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t thought about how to respond, Itis has come over and held him in her arms, “Welcome to Glentown, father. Is this OK? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the heart immediately vanished, he touched his daughter's long hair, and mixed feelings.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; It is clearly born to the first lady, but the personality is very different from the biological mother, and even completely different from herself. Sometimes he does not understand how Itis grew up to be what it is today. There is no shortage, if it is not on her face to see some of the ladies' appearances when they are young, he will doubt whether Itis is his own daughter.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;But when the two of them embraced each other, the Duke felt the kind of closeness of the blood - she was still raising the big Northland pearls.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After a while, Isis just pushed him away. "A sweaty smell, you still have to take a bath first." I brought a few pieces of soap from the winter city, take a piece to try, the cleaning effect is much better than the saponin. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kind of thing can be slowed down first," Calvin looked around. "Right, the Earl of Haier?" Why didn't he greet me in the hall? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I drove him back to the Earl's Court on the outskirts." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? "The Duke looked at his daughter in surprise.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He did not agree with his will, and did not take your order seriously, if not, I arrived in time. He is afraid that he will get angry with the leading troops. "Itis shrugged. "Not everyone can see the road under their feet, and some even have the courage to open their eyes." For such people, I will not talk more about it. It is the most convenient choice to drive away. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will give up the castle and the town? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He won't, but I have the first army in my hand," she smiled. "This army had captured Wangdu in one day." What do you think can be done by a dozen or so knights? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know if it is an illusion. In just over two months, Isis became a little different from the past. Her smile is more natural. Rather than deliberately decorating the aristocratic smile in a communicative occasion. And her eyes are full of a sense of freedom, Calvin thought, this look has been gone for a long time after her adulthood.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
