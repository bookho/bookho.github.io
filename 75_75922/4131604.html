			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning only felt like a whirlwind, and when she came back, she found that the black long needles were filled with thick fingers - these non-reflective spar A black blade is equally distributed around the track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several similar explosions coming from the camp, completely breaking the silence of the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy is using the spider magic to launch a sneak attack on the expeditionary army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she realized this, the second wave of roaring had already appeared, but the voice was obviously much more dull, and not from the air, but through the ground. The tremors passed to the feet, as if there were any heavy objects that broke into the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Worse, bad..." Luo Jia snorted. "That is the position of the fortress position."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night without lights, accurately distinguish the location of the camp, and start from the artillery at the beginning, is this really what the devil can do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why is the alarm not yet ringing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to remind everyone!" Because it is sneak out, the lightning does not wear a special flight suit, the signature used to contact is naturally not Carrying it with you, there is no other way to fly than it is - although the sound of the explosion over the camp is obviously much denser. She grabbed Luo Jia, but she could not pull the other person from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Lightning turned back and was surprised to find that the latter was nailed into the leg by a long needle, and blood was flowing through the wound. The trousers have been dyed red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly felt her chest tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Luojia is not trying to save her...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think," Luo Jia "Oh, even if I didn't meet you, I would be attacked as usual, maybe even worse. At least the stone needles that fell on the outside were not stained with the blood of the devil. This can only be a skin injury." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What skin trauma, obvious bones have been broken, and this amount of bleeding is not known whether there is damage to the large blood vessels, if any, can not even easily pull out Long needles. But put her here to find Nana Va? In case the Spider Devils attack again, Loga is almost a live target lying on the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning felt a lot of thoughts in his head for a moment, but for a moment I didn’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to me," Luo Jia held her shoulder. "You have to contact the big guy who runs on the railway..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean the Heihe River?" Lightning glimpsed, "but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now even if there is no The alarm, as long as it is not a scorpion, should also hear the attack." The wolf gasped for two breaths and endured the pain. "The key is the next counterattack - if I didn't get it wrong, at least half of the enemy attacked. It’s all directed at the fortress, and it doesn’t sound like a simple stone shot. I don’t know what it’s like now, but in case... if you’re succeeded by the enemy, we won’t be able to suppress each other. Weapons. You know what it means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It means that the spider magic can pour black long needles into the camp unscrupulously, and the entire line of defense will not be safe. All. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call...just go..." Luo Jia pushed her. "Don’t look here is the first place to be attacked, but actually Nothing is dangerous... The blow is not directed at us. Look there..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning looks in the direction of the other’s finger, only seeing There are only half of the wooden sentry towers at the end of the track, as if they were swallowed up by the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is right, and I want to inform the crusader train between the front line and the zero station that there is no faster way than flying past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning clenched his fist and finally glanced at her, forcing himself to turn around and pull up and flew toward the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time there have been scattered gunshots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Luo Jia said, the entire camp has been awakened, although no one knows where the enemy is coming from, but no one will sit still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of the witch’s barracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer witch is the fastest-reacting group of fighters. Not only does not sleep for a long time, but even the armor does not need to go off when going to sleep. At this moment, they are going to the battlefield in twos and threes. . She plunged into the house and saw the wheat rush that was in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are you going?" The latter saw her, and rushed up and hugged him. "Why don't you tell me when you go out!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry," Lightning felt a guilty feeling. She thought that the wheat was thick and thick, and she didn't know what it was, but it was not. Mai Hao will not put the fear of high-level devils in his heart for too long, but it does not mean that she will forget her companions. "I will say later, I have to go to the Heihe River now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will go with you!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I need you here." Although I really wanted to agree, Lightning finally refused to the other side. "It’s hard to rely on Sylvie alone to take care of the entire camp and detect the devil’s movements. The more people, the better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get up! She can't delay her for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, before that, I need you to do one thing." Lightning sets the flight suit at the fastest speed, then dials the wheat Long hair, holding her cheek, "You must promise that I must do it - this is the most important trust of the expedition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕?" Mai lost his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found Nana Wa, take her to the end of the railway. Luo Jia was seriously injured, lying in the area. Take her safely back, understand? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜powered his head, "Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is handed over to You are." Lightning touched her forehead with her, then turned around and flew straight out of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the height climbed, she also noticed why the alarm was not being heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five towers set up on the outer ring of the line of defense did not have one left - obviously the first wave of the enemy’s attack was directed at the guard post. . Originally, these guarding points should be solid cement bunkers, but the tower No. 1 site has just been put into construction, not to mention the complete fortifications, even the barbed wire outside the ditch has not been able to hang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes lightning even more disturbing is that the sound of the gunshots comes from inside the camp, that is, the soldiers are fighting the enemy in the camp. So far, the entire line of defense has not been broken. Although the enemy's attack is still going on, it is a long-range strike. Who are they fighting with? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more so, she became more aware of the importance of her responsibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a coward, yes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lost to the high-level devil, and that’s right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I still have what I can do -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is flying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afraid to make it scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want to go north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the ordinary devil does not need to face it personally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
