			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Anna opened her eyes, there was a red-hot part, and the hot air rushed to the surface, causing hot skin pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are flames everywhere, and the smoke rolls from under the shed, making people breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cry in the inner house, or just an illusion, the wood sizzling under the flames of the flames, from time to time there are Mars and burning wood from The top of the head fell. She climbed down the haystack and tried to walk two steps into the inner room, and was quickly pushed back by the heat wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last she only fled the ground to escape the huts, watching the house being swallowed by the raging fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbors also came around and some people started to help save the fire, but the recent source of water is the Chishui River outside the town, and a few cans of water are in the face of the fire. To no avail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After running back and forth, Anna finally saw her father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just came back from the mine hole, wearing a dirty coat on his body, his face was gray and dusty, standing on his face with a blank face The wooden side of the residential side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I saw the heart of the heart, she could no longer hold back the panic and panic of her heart, tears rolling down like beads, crying and running to her father, tight Hug him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the father did not comfort her as she hoped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about your mother?" He grabbed her shoulder and tried to make her cry out loud. "And your brother!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna shook her head, but did not expect that it would be a slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You actually escaped alone! Why not save them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn How can you just look at yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ann’s fiercely sitting up from the bed, gasping for a big breath, screaming as if still reverberating in her ear, long time never Scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the cup from the bed and drank the cold water, and it took a while to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the month, Anna will dream of this scene, just like someone in the brain is reminding her, looking at the desk calendar on the desk, today It is just the end of the first weekend of the summer, and it is also the day when the Witch Alliance pays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dressed and simply washed, then walked out of the castle to the Witch Building in the backyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anse Sister!" When she saw her, the bell immediately opened the flower. "You come so early!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning," Wendy said softly. "Today's weather looks good. Would you like to go to the North Hill Hill later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna...Adult," the two former students also quickly went to salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just like calling me Anna in peacetime." She waved her hand and sat down at the long table, hesitating. "I still have something else to do." Do, I will go there in the afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? It’s really rare," Wendy showed a look of interest. "It’s hard to be with Roland." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walk in the street!" Bell said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pearls and gray rabbits on the side can't help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna shook her head, but did not go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter did not ask, but took an envelope from the drawer and handed it to her. "This month's salary, two golden dragons."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witches don’t have to prepare themselves for food, clothing, and shelter. Even if they are luxury goods sold in the convenience market, they will basically try them out first. Even if they want more, it’s not a problem, so most people think that pay is not useful, nor I understand why I insist on doing this. Anna could probably guess Roland’s intentions, and this move invisibly helped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the salary back to the castle hall, the chief knight Carter Lannes has been waiting there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Anna," he asked, "as usual?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Um," she took a golden dragon out of the envelope and handed it to the Cavaliers. "As usual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Bianyan Town was rebuilt, all the aborigines were assigned to a house, and Anna’s father was no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sold Anna to the church at the price of twenty-five golden dragons, and Anna never had any communication with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From that moment on, he is no longer her father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are things that she can’t completely stay out of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, this is the golden dragon for living expenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably like most poor people who suddenly get a windfall, he didn’t keep the money for too long—gambling, fraud, and theft made him short Within half a year, it fell into a poverty-stricken situation. At that time, Anna had not yet made a name for herself. However, she was recognized by some aborigines when she sealed the wall with a fire. He tried to entrust his neighbor to visit his daughter but was rejected by his neighbor. Got a bit of ridicule. Later, the matter was passed to Carter, who was responsible for forming the militia. Carter revealed it to Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, she understood that she had to do something to let her father who sold her cover the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t want the other person to bother Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two came to a quiet neighborhood in the east of the city and climbed to the second floor of the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter turned back, "Miss Anna, you are here waiting for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "You are in trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, just raise your hand." He walked over to the door and slammed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the door slammed open. "Ah... it turned out to be a knight, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did you open the door for so long, what?" Carter yelled, "Let it open, don't block it at the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes, yes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna leaned against the wall of the aisle and sighed in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, she didn’t want to pay attention to this former father at all, but she knew that putting it aside would only make the situation worse. Moreover, she can't come out personally, otherwise the paranoia and the arrogance of the situation will make the other side habitually put forward the father's prestige, so that it will not serve as a deterrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of begging him, let him realize that the status of the two is like a world apart. As the chief knight familiar to the people in the Bianbu District, Carter is already a great aristocrat in the eyes of ordinary people. The cost of sealing this golden dragon as a seal, plus some strict warnings, should make him no longer vocal, no need to kneel down. For this purpose, carry a bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between Anna did not understand before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since she was arrested and imprisoned, she lost interest in everything, and the world completely turned into a dead gray, until Roland rescued her, she Only then saw a different color from the past. After living in the castle for a while, Anna gradually understood the complex relationship between people, and also had a new understanding of her father's anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
