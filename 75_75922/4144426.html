			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Victor’s most anticipated moment finally arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The premiere of "The Dust of Destruction" was scheduled to start at 3 pm, and he came to the door of the theater early and waited for the ticket to enter. Not seen in a year, this theater dedicated to the Shadows has expanded a lot. Not only have several movie viewing rooms been added, but also waiting halls and courtyards have been added outside. Although he arrived half an hour earlier, there were still many people gathered in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Mr. Gamol of the Crescent Moon Chamber of Commerce, and I will be lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Where, I didn't expect to see the big businessman in the morning here. Please pay more attention to the business in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not the card standing there. Do you know the master of the Golden Theatre? I don't know if I can see the master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you know, please help me introduce it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people gathered together in twos and threes to talk about each other. As he expected, the price of dozens of Golden Dragons is basically the upper celebrity, and this is one of the hidden value of the premiere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, isn’t this Mr. Victor? I heard that you have changed your career and are no longer doing jewelry business?” Among the crowd, occasionally someone recognizes it. he comes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Still doing it, it’s just not very recent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Chamber of Commerce new The bed that I got out was very much liked by me. After the hotel was replaced, I had a lot more repeat customers. I want to order another hundred sets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thank you for your affirmation. After watching the shadows, we can talk about it in some places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then it will be fixed."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exquisite side of the singer is very vocal, probably for her, it is unimaginable to make dozens of hundreds of Golden Dragon transactions. It’s hard to wait until no one is talking, only to pull Lavikdo’s clothes corner. “Sir, are these people coming to see the shadows or talking about business? And I have seen many people and you didn’t know before. "Don't you be afraid that they will lie to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, this is commonplace for businessmen, and habits are good." Victor smiled. After all, the merchant who is willing to buy the premiere ticket is a kind of strength. Once he enters this circle, he can gain the recognition of others to a large extent. The shadow is not a real thing, nothing will remain after reading, so in a sense, it is more convincing than a full-bodied jewelry necklace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he walked and explained, he suddenly collided with the people passing by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...sorry," Victor noticed that the other woman was a woman and took the lead to apologize, but when he saw the appearance of the victim, he could not help but stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a lifeless face. It’s not bad for the five senses. If you dress up a little, you should be above the exquisite. But the pale temperament and empty eyes almost ruined all of this, and people couldn't help but feel the feeling of disgust and escaping - such a gloomy look, it really seems out of place with the atmosphere in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman did not say anything, just looked at him and continued to move forward with no expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a weirdo... Victor secretly swears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr.!" Didn’t notice the exquisiteness of this scene, grabbing his hand and shouting, "The shadow is coming, let's go in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... um." Victor shook his head and threw this unhappiness behind his head, followed the exquisitely toward the cinema. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened just now?" Joe looked worriedly at Farina . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say and say it," Joe hesitated to hold her hand, but finally failed to reach out. "Don't forget that I am by your side at all times."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina did not answer, and he came here to be the biggest reward she could give. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been nearly half a year since I arrived in Winter City. The ancient witch who claimed to have come from more than 400 years ago did not lie. Her injury was cured a little. From the moment I can't move at all, I can walk on my own. Although the whiplash and the mark on the body still exist, Farina has no complaints. If she is a witch who falls in the hands of the church, she will only be ten million times worse than this. She can do this for the enemy, she What else to say? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the expected trial did not arrive, even the king of the Grey Fortress did not see her, but sent someone to ask her dozens of questions. There will be no more. Some problems she deliberately lied, wanting to trigger the anger of the other party, but in exchange for a sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being released from prison, Joe bought a house to settle her down. Unlike her, Joe, who was a nobleman, quickly got a job in the Executive Office and quickly adapted to his new identity—or he shouldn’t be a church member. But this did not bring a turn for Farina, but it was a torture. Because the longer she stays in winter without the winter, the more she knows about the city, the more she realizes the mistakes of the church. Witches have nothing to do with hell devils. They have the same magical power as ordinary people. Roland Wimbledon, who used the power of witches, did not make his city a magical cave. Even if it was a blind man, he could not deny the thriving scene here. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side is her half-life loyalty to the church, on the one hand is the negation of everything she does, and the two thoughts alternate and conflict, making Farina very painful. Perhaps this is a trial in itself, and sometimes even more severe than torture. If Joe doesn't need her, she is afraid that she has already chosen herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, Farina didn’t know how long she could support, she thought that the two tickets sent by the Star Flower Troupe would be overwhelming. The last straw. Kajin Fez was inevitably entrusted by Roland to write this script. The purpose is undoubtedly to completely reverse the world's views on the church and further consolidate the Wimbledon family's throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can already imagine that, after this, the church will become the object of everyone’s rejection, the last effort of Tucker’s adults... and countless to him The trial judges who sacrificed on the wall are just a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina didn’t want to see this moment, but she promised Joe’s invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she despised the escaping church executives, they still accepted their commission and stood up to stabilize the order of Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she was needed by Joe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... this is probably the last reward she can make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights are getting darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the darkness enveloped the entire viewing room, the shadow began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story begins at the Hermes Plateau more than three hundred years ago. The new holy city is still a piece of stone. The picture passes over the steep mountain wall. After leaping into the snow, the panoramic view of the desolate mountains is unobstructed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there have been several experiences of watching the shadows, when this scene overlooking the earth is in the eye, Victor still feels direct to the soul. Tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the big gap, he saw that many believers are busy building their new city, as if this was really the world three hundred years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the picture pulled again to the ground and fell vertically into a huge deep pit - under the narration, Victor listened for the first time It is the name of the "central institution" of the core organization of the church. From the whispering sounds around you, the feelings of others are similar to him. Starting from the unknown secrets, this is the most attractive topic, and the propaganda on the “history that only the royal family was qualified to know” has greatly contributed to the audience's interest. Soon, Victor's attention was completely attracted to the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
