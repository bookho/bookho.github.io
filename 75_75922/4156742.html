			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a drizzle on the shore of the Twin Bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the change in the sky caused by the test explosion, or a coincidence, Ai Gesha is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent explosion set off a spectacular water column on the sea, even if it was fifteen kilometers away. Unlike the gray-blue background, the rising water column appears pure white, as if it does not belong to the sea. The water column rises slowly, as if losing weight – the whole process lasts for tens of seconds, and this scene is beyond the common sense of most bystanders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It eventually turned into a raindrop and returned to the sea, replaced by a twisted white mist, which is larger and taller than the water column, until now, Still able to see that strange cloud of smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the sailboats that originally gathered around the test point, they have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain is coming up at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to participate in the first snow mountain test has always been her regret, and now it is finally added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha can’t help but think of the winter two years ago. After the winter city’s demonstration of artillery, Roland’s conversation with Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exothermic reaction between chemical materials is just one of the lowest in the explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reproduce the sun's glory is his goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the nonsense of "sputum radiation", the overall situation is quite reliable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a little surprising that she didn’t have any applause in this audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrat who was invited to sit in a chair seems to have forgotten his head and ears, many people look extremely complicated, and even a flash of light in his eyes Fear of meaning. As a representative of the gray fort, Aegis originally prepared a large number of passionate words in accordance with Roland's intentions, but after seeing this scene, he immediately got up and left the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can fully guess the thoughts of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes silence can explain everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, His Majesty has fulfilled his promise that the morning monks attending the conference have witnessed human capabilities through their own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next data collection work is naturally carried out by a dedicated industrial staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than half an hour, the preliminary conclusion was sent to her: the test explosion achieved the expected results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha tied the "everything goes smoothly" note to the flight messenger and raised his hand to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger spread its wings and soon disappeared into the west sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the air raid on the other side is going well, she thought quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the castle of Glow City, the staff is combing the integrated air raid The latest information coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this attack is very ideal. The devil probably did not expect that humans will launch a new attack so quickly after the failure of the desperate mountains, plus the empty knight is born. The flexibility of the enemy makes the enemy react when it approaches the god of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation means that the devil has the ability to fly this tens of kilometers of land, but has no ability to fully monitor the area, which not only allows the first army to With a bottom in mind, it also gave the Seagull the opportunity to record the position of all the beasts. They are different from the two-wing aircraft and do not require a flat open space to take off and land. Unified scheduling in wartime. Therefore, the large black stone tower inhabited by the beasts is undoubtedly a target worthy of attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Air Knight not only discovered its existence, but also confirmed that it could be weakened by continuous bombing - although the principle is unknown, this feature is almost the same as the high-order devil's usual barrier capability, but the range is much larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the relationship between the two can be established, the staff can roughly calculate the firepower required to break through the barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the above information, the loss of the four Skyfire has been the smallest price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Manfred Kastein?" Roland put down the report and said, "He really deserves a good reward."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a determination is not difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty is to have the determination and the ability to achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the devil city over the sky, with his own understanding to complete the dive bombing, and finally led the teammates safely separated, this talent can only be described as extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will pass on this award to him," Tilly shrugged, then whispered, "I have never seen..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, nothing. I still have something to do, just go first. One step," Tilly turned and walked outside the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland heard a chuckle behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...do you hear what she said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Night grin, "but basically can guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Say it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She is five fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So much?" Roland was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is going to be her Royal Princess, this is already a discount."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Okay, deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale happily licked his lips. "The talent of the empty knight is really good, but you boast too much. Among all the empty knights, whose talent is the most outstanding is not a clear-cut thing? You seem to take what you can do as a matter of course, but not for the parties.” She said a little bit here. "After all, this thing is not something we can take the initiative, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Indeed, ability is also a gift...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sat by the window of the Rose Cafe and looked out at the streets where people from outside came to the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a high starting point, but if you want to play it out, you can’t do much with it. I’ve really ignored this recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland draws his gaze and sees the tile Kiris sat down with two cups of coffee opposite him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I’m thinking about how to get to the bottomless," he temporarily threw a happy distraction and told the general process of the air attack on God. Again, "Is this magic barrier covering a large area related to the ability of a high-level devil? Is it a technology that has only recently been researched?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I If you are yours, you will no longer use the name "Devil". "Wakiris is not very airy. "The specific ability of my family depends on the type of magic stone. The choice of shield magic stone is just that it has good compatibility and high practicality. It is not necessarily the ability to have it - for example, I There is no fusion of such magic stones. In addition, no matter how the scope of the magic stone can not cover a whole tower of birth, it should be another research result of the mask. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
