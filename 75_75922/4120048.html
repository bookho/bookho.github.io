			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it’s unheard of. If the devil had this ability four hundred years ago, the witch empire would not say that it would last for ten years. I am afraid that it will be devil in a year or two. Get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, relying on a small number of extraordinary people, can not compete with the endless enemy, once each outpost is placed a stone of the gods, witch Just sit and wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland naturally knows how difficult it is to cut such a sacred stone pillar. The more complete and firm the characteristics of the stone, the primitive boulder at the bottom of the northern slope mine. Even with a musket at a close distance, only a few white spots can be left. The only method of mining is to use a magical blood to erode and peel off and then cut and polish. Therefore, the larger stone is worth a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if the stone in the town hall of Hermes Cathedral is not so great - from the description of the ice witch, the devil actually It is like cutting a piece of rough stone directly with a certain weapon. If the other party has mastered the incredible processing technology, it is a deeper understanding of the magic power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which is not good news for humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking at the new weapons of the devil, they haven’t been idle for four hundred years..." Roland beat the desk, "The third time." The battle of God's will probably be more difficult than expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial fears were fulfilled, and they are now more cunning than the devils of the federation era. There has also been considerable progress in technology. A mixed life like a crawling monster is a weapon specially designed to deal with ordinary fighting witches. The two-kilometer range is enough to make them fight against the opponent's unprepared situation. When the witch army reacts, it is basically too late to use. Ability. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you have an observer like Sylvie, as long as the enemy is covered, the witch who is limited to five meters can protect the next teammates? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I don't want to admit it, the devil's evolution rate is indeed faster than us." Zoe said, "If this is a war in the federation era, we I’m afraid I’ve been defeated.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can imagine it, being clipped by two breads, broken in the back road, high-order devils in the sky, and on the ground The number is far more than the witch's madness, plus the new devil with a wide range of killing ability, it is estimated that only a very small number of witches can escape from the ambush circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question now is, are these five crawling monsters the only trump card of the devil, or a small part of the advance army? In addition to the aliens like crawling monsters, has the devil developed other weapons of war? What will they look like, how should they respond? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the information that no winter city needs to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting the results, the next is the casualties of the First Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this part, Roland knew about it after the battle, and the detailed statistics after four days did not go too far, no doubt, This is the credit of both Nana Va and Lily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were more than 190 people injured in the army, and 75 people were killed, most of them were caused by crawling monsters - from above the trenches The stone needles that were injected made the soldiers inevitable, and they did not enter the soil after penetrating the human body. It was almost nailed into the ditch. In order to send the injured to the ambulance camp, the emergency squad had to pull out the stone needle more than one meter long, which caused massive bleeding. Many of the key injuries and incorrect rescue methods have caused many people to stop breathing in a matter of minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland certainly won’t blame the ambulance staff – in fact, the first appearance of the first aid squad has already gained a lot of time for the injured soldiers. What's more, Nana Va's magic must not be able to treat so many injuries at the same time. Therefore, it is only possible to use the method of running water, and then start to heal from the fatal wound, so that the emergency treatment of minor injuries is particularly important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, as the scale of the war continues to expand, Nana Vawa will be able to take care of the wounded, and the first army will still have to rely on its own strength. Solve the problem of treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bring back the ashes of the sacrificial warrior," he said, "the grey fort will not forget them."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
