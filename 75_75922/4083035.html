			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ashes said, Zall Silvermoon was very pleased with her arrival, and the warm embrace after the meeting made Luo Jia’s raised hands Knowing where to put it - it is reasonable to say that the tribute is the way the patriarch greets the patriarch. Although the age of the silver moon is one or two years younger than her, from the status point, she should be the first to the clan. It’s right to hold the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no high-profile attitude after the conversation, especially when she admitted that she planned to go with them to the Winter City. Treating her as a sister, she also asked Luo Jia to call her back, and introduced the situation where the witches lived there with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Luo Jia is not completely serious, after all, the content of the echo is really exaggerated, even if the gray fort is richer and more abundant, it will not make every Individuals fill their stomachs. If that is the case, is there not enough food to eat, and a witch to expel sickness and plague, is it not like the God of heaven? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she has never been to the desert, she has heard many stories about the northern kingdom, and like Tiesha City, she can live a life of arrogance and extravagance. The small group of people who are in the high position, and the echo should be one of them. She doesn't think she can win the favor of the great chief like the Princess of Aosha - no longer inherits the goddess of the fanatic clan, apparently not as valuable as the echo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Luo Jia does not care about these. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as there are stronger enemies there, it will be possible for her to continue fighting. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s when the fanatic clan also plans to move to the clear water port, the reaction of the people is not as pleasant as Luo Jia’s expected, especially staying The "Aosha Zhonggou" iron axe on the side also frowned slightly. Only the echo showed a happy smile. "Really? Great! So how long will it take for the clear water port to restore the prosperity of the past?" The purpose of His Majesty can be realized soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough...Echo," the iron axe gave her a wink. "This is just them. The plan does not necessarily come true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s also, I am too impatient," Echo smiled slightly embarrassedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia immediately understood the problem. As the head of the former clan, the fan of the flames together with the vassal, there are more than 5,000 people, than the current arrival in the clear water port The number of Saudis is even more. Compared to a prestigious big clan, it is obviously easier for small clan to compete with each other and compete with each other. They probably did not expect that the tribes living in Tiesha City would be so determined that it is reasonable to say that there is no need to worry that the six clan of the oasis will not leave their own territory in the end, and will never even rely on the chieftain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she did not continue to talk about this matter, and the flames will bring them higher influence, and naturally change the balance of power in this region. . If the Aosha clan, or the king of the Grey Fort, does not have the ability to control it, it would be fine for the father to be anti-customer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still the third princess of the Fanyan clan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few days, Luojia will have nothing to do along the Clear Water Bay Strolling, since she has seen the ashes, she is not in a hurry to rush to the winter city. Taking advantage of this time, she intends to carefully examine the immortal land that this mad flame will settle in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia soon discovered that the speed at which the Grey Fortress built the house was somewhat beyond her imagination. On the edge of the river, they built a row of hemispherical kiln, using a mixture of river sand and mud to produce a batch of bricks every day. The fuel is not the wood that is cut down on the ground, but the gray-black stone that is transported from a ship in the northwest. It can be burned all day long by filling it into the stove, which is better than charcoal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the most popular work of the sand people, and most of them are women and seniors. They seem to be divided into several groups, each of which has a pile of dirt or When carrying a frame of black stone, a manager will press a mark on his arm. According to the results she observed, the amount of food delivered per day is determined by these imprints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the construction section, it is rare to see the figure of the sand people, and the gray castle people almost everything. They used another gray powder to stir the water into a paste and stacked the bricks layer by layer. Each house is built in the same way and in the same way, and new changes can be seen almost every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
