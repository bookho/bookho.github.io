			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland silently recalled and confirmed that he had not remembered correctly - the high-level devil stood on the high platform at the time, guiding the two promoters to kill each other. The white gauze flying on it has a sharp contrast with the red foggy Tianchi under the foot, and the eyeball on the top of the head is shining with a dazzling brilliance. Such a scene with a sense of picture can be immediately seen by closing your eyes a little. The mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after excluding the biggest difference, there are some other places, Roland can't help but the devil's martial artist named "Wakiris" Produced a strong curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it was his turn to shake hands, he didn’t finish the process as before, but stopped at the bedside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also a resident of the community?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are already ready to go A ward, I can't help but hear this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakirith looked indifferent, she seemed to think about how to pick up, and then shook her head after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the female devil in the memory fragment should be much older than the one who was swallowed by the scorpion, and should not be a prisoner of the soul battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then do you have siblings? Are you particularly similar to you?" Roland pointed to the index. "For example, if there is one more eye here?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some commotion in the crowd, and the guard coughed twice, "Mr. Roland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I will be right away," Roland waved. "I just think she is inexplicable like a person I used to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mouth, "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could it be, I have never seen anyone from the Kajid Peninsula have three eyes," someone whispered "There are a lot of three fingers down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Roland held the last thought of trying, suddenly said coldly, "Xia Li Tower!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person’s eyes are nothing but as if he is stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Wakiris is the devil from the other side of the memory debris, you should always respond to this devil language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it looks just like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shrugged and extended his right hand. "I hope that you can get better soon, return to the association, fight side by side with everyone, and fight against erosion."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She obviously hesitated, then slowly reached out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when the two hands were held together, Roland couldn’t help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian screamed, "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her hand is so cool... ...and there is still some wetness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who can't help but laugh out loud. In the deliberately low laughter, Roland also heard a few whispers of dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flirty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did the old school choose such a person?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the patient needs rest, please go to the next victim," the doctor shook his head helplessly. "Really..."<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shrugged, as the creator of the dream world, he did not care much about these people's views, but since there is nothing to ask, it is meaningless to stay here. Finally, I swept Wakiris and he turned and left the ward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
