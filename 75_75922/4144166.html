			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third side of the city, the underground laboratory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the report, Roland arrived here with Anna for the first time. Through the thick protective glass, he saw the center of the laboratory covered by the lead. The two ritual cubes are inactive - one of them looks normal, and the other bursts of red light are significantly shorter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The red cube with the short red light... is the latest imitation?" Anna asked sharply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, in fact, its appearance is entirely due to a mistake." Serin replied cheerfully, "The internal lines of the Rubik's Cube are usually made up of thin wrists." To engrave, if the material is damaged, it is easy to be ruined. Generally speaking, these erroneous 'stones' will be discarded, but when the tweezer was engraved on the 236 component a week ago, it was not until the end of the problem - - A small crack in the center of the stone has caused this component to appear paralyzed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The materials used in the ritual cubes are all from the extreme south, inferred from the murals. These relics have been sleeping for at least a thousand years on the ground, and the wind has been soaked for so long. The poor texture is very normal. Roland thought, "And you didn't throw 236 away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin little bit of the Lord, "I felt a pity at the time, after all, it The whole has been completed, and maybe it will still come in handy. So I replaced this part of the early Rubik's cube with this 236 and wanted to see if it can work properly."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, this is a nuclear power torture tool, Roland wiped the sweat in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured," said Celine as he saw his thoughts and raised his sarcoma-like head. "I am a weapon in the mountains of desperate mountains." The tests carried out on the test site, if there is an accident, will never affect the absence of a winter city. This is the basic belief of the members of the Quest. Even if I am unfortunately killed, you don’t have to be sad. In order to seek the truth, I have already personally been at risk. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the endless appearance of the other side, Roland’s original fear of dissipating quickly dissipated, "Say business!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough...is rude," Celine cleared her throat. "In short, as you can see, the Rubik's Cube can still be activated normally, but the range of red light. Shortened to less than one-tenth of the original. But this does not prevent the heat from being supplied to the three-cylinder cube power, so I did a heating test to determine if the shortened red light heating efficiency has changed - this test is intermittent. It lasted for two or three days, until I checked the uranium tablets, I accidentally Now it hasn't changed much, even the consumption of magic has been reduced a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthing indulges for a moment, "It’s hard to be... most of the Rubik’s Cube’s cost Used to maintain the red light?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a high-level awakened person who is younger than Ai Gesha," Catherine applauded. "I think After a long time, I also tend to answer this question - if the light is composed of countless small balls, it is not easy to want them to move in the same direction. And the test proves that as long as it does not touch the red Light, its front and sides are not affected, so it seems that the shortening of the light really saves a lot of effort for the Rubik's Cube."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait," Roland said suddenly. "That is to say, the 236 component of the flaw determines the distance of the Rubik's Cube?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a breakthrough Sexual discovery is even more significant than solving the problem of endurance! There are more than 300 components in the ritual cube. These stones with different shapes and textures are pieced together like bricks. No one knows how the magic works in it. But now, the problem seems to have a way of analysing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can think so." Celine's tone also faintly reveals excitement. "Maybe the lines on each component play a specific role. If you can analyze the meaning of those glyphs, you can understand how the magic cubes use magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One component is responsible for a function, From this aspect, the way of thinking of the radioactive family is quite similar to ours," Anna said with a smile. "I should say that this is human luck?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Of course." Roland nodded without hesitation - he naturally understood what Anna said, the difference between different civilizations is huge, not only in form, language, but in thought, they are separated from each other. The chances of finding an object that can be understood and enlightened can be described as minimal. The underground civilization is an example. It is also the core instrument for manipulating the magic. But it can only control its operation after becoming a carrier. Celine has been studying for hundreds of years and still can't understand its principle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
