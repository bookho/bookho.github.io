			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny is sticking to him like this, listening to all the experiences of the witch who accidentally entered the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So they can all recover the lost feeling and return to the normal life?" She gave a sigh of relief, most of the tone was sincere I am happy, and some are embarrassed and regretful. "It’s good... if I can go and see the world you have been to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's too expensive for you to do this only by turning the soul into a light column," Roland stroked her hair and earlobe. "And we can build a winter city into an ideal look. Reality doesn't lose dreams at all, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is nothing wrong with this," Anna chuckled. "But do you have a dim sum now?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诶?" Roland groaned, "No, I am just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No need to answer, let me listen," the girl put her head on his chest. After a while, he whispered. "Well... there are two guilty consciences and a bit of worry; The illusion is that because Felice is a woman, she is very beautiful. The worry is that I am afraid of thinking more. I guess it is right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Uh..." In the face of this correct statement that can't be correct, Roland didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny snorted out. "But there are still seven points that are frank, so your worries are all too much. Don't worry." She paused. Suddenly, the tone became serious. "Roland, you made this decision to help them. Just like saving me and the co-help club, how can I care for this little thing? This is exactly one The duty of the king, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was relieved a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you change to a nightingale, he can't guarantee that the other person won't think about it, but Anna is different. What she believes is that she really believes, without a hint of disguise. Moreover, it can be seen from her expression that she is supportive of the fact that she gives the Taqila witch a home and let them regain lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna's kindness is a nature, and this has not changed since the day she met her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But after you do what you do in your dreams, tell me, understand?" She licked the blue eyes of Lake Biwa, in his ear. I whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded, "I promise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annan smiles with satisfaction, slow Climbing to him, his hands holding his cheek, "Then the next time, you are mine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girl gently bites his clothes Collar, all the way down...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sweet gasping of the two in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, when the amazing news of the Philip Ribbon came back, the first The three sides of the city are like blasting pots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you interrupt consciousness within the scope of the light column, you can regain your original appearance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is not important at all. The key is to restore touch and smell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it really so delicious? How about honey sauce?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you take me to the world of dreams?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"And me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also want to go..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People Surrounded by Felice, he snarled in a slap in the face, completely without the usual indifference. Even in the face of the beasts invading the labyrinth, they were not so excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
