			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cage Hill, the command post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head, another piece of the same information..." The clown took a piece of paper and walked over to Hill Fox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if things have passed for several years, the original circus partners still habitually call him the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you send it from?" Hill took the paper and swept it. "Can it be traced back to the source?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The location of the messenger is flying in the south of Yongdong, there are three cities over there, and there are no other tips on the seal."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill frowned for a moment, then suddenly stood up, "Help me to inform the Iron Man and Lord Itis, we may have trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 minutes later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis dropped the information and tapped the table, "...that is, this happened at the same time in the winter?<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill nodded. "Although it is impossible to confirm which cities are actually implementing this order, from the perspective of the distribution of intelligence, it is not an overstatement. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few days, the intelligence department has received several similar secrets.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The letter shows that the nobility is using compulsory means to move local residents.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their movements are all north.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The similarity is so consistent, but the intelligence from different regions is almost impossible to misrepresent or forge. In other words, the aristocrats of Yongdong are launching a unified action.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the letter simply mentions the word "migration", it is by no means a trivial matter. The carrying capacity of a city has its limits, and too few or too many people will cause it to collapse. There are more things to be considered on the migration road, such as food for people to eat, temporary shelter, belongings, etc.... There is no such thing as a winter city. It can even be said that the cities ruled by the old nobility simply cannot afford to complete a large-scale migration. Without strong strength and material support, the so-called migration is just a road to death. Indeed, most aristocrats do not care about the lives of civilians, but only when civilians are "individuals." The taxation and domination of the lord is inseparable from the civilian population. If there is no cure for the next person, then the powerful power will be meaningless. Once these civilians find that they cannot benefit from the migration, they will inevitably lose all their hearts. What's more, when a large number of people gather together, it is easy to cause riots, so even if it is a ruthless aristocrat, it will not easily do such amazing things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now more than one aristocrat is doing this, but the whole North is doing this, clearly being instructed by other forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Winter Kingdom has the ability to do this, and only the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But why does the devil do this?" Itis said suspiciously to himself, "If you just want to weaken the war potential of the Grey Fort, you can All the civilians have killed... If there is a spider, the nobles are unwilling and unable to stop it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe the devil thinks...they are useful." Xiao Xiaochen tried to speculate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not necessary to force them to migrate," Hill shook his head. "Yong Dong is the least of the big cities in the four kingdoms, even Wang Du It can only accommodate 20,000 to 30,000 without pre-preparation, let alone their mobile route is not the end of the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The northernmost big city Yes..." Itis looked at the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Snow Castle, backed by the source of the desolate mountains, only half of the size of the king." Film immediately added the relevant information, "because of its unique terrain, often live The lower population is also the first place where red fog appears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the enemy will never do more than one thing," Itis nodded in agreement. "I feel that there must be something we have not noticed, and the devil has taken this seemingly unexplained action." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What will happen to that change?" asked the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know..." Itis slowly said, "But it shouldn't be good news. Let's inform the front line and let them raise their vigilance." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This red cloud...is it the location of the devil's obelisk? "Tilly muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," said the lightning starely. "At this distance, we should not see the red fog..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't see? Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the red fog is flowing down!" It’s Mai Mai. "I have seen the scene of fog falling from the edge of a desperate mountain, just like a waterfall!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I don't know if red fog is heavier than air, which makes them easier to gather at low altitudes, but one thing is certain. When the red fog invades the eastern kingdom from the mainland spine, the mountain is not red." Added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean, they were squatting down the ravine?" Terry browed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she will say that there is no red fog in this distance - now they are hundreds of kilometers from the highest mountain in the continent, if red If the fog does not rise, it will inevitably be hindered by the layers of mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than that," Lightning surely said, "I visited the north of the desperate mountains a month ago and approached the edge of the red fog area, but At that time, there was no such red cloud on the mainland spine. It... does not seem to have risen from the Great Rift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly can’t help but feel behind her rise She was chilling, and she gradually noticed that the red color on the mountain is not a thin layer, but a whole from top to bottom. More precisely, it is like a pour from the cloud. The huge cloud column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stared at the vision in front of her eyes and said after a short silence. "There is a way to make us see more clearly."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning looked up and looked at the dark clouds overhead. "I think so too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly High, the farther you look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as they can incorporate the continental spine into the fundus, it is possible to see the true face of the red cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If that's the case, then try it out -" Tilly added the throttle to the maximum again, pulling up the nose and climbing to the clouds, and lightning was tight. Follow the cockpit and try to cover the Tilly with the same magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the collaboration of the two, the altimeter pointer on the Phoenix deflected to the end a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it rises to the height of 7,500 meters, the earth has already shown a clear arc, and the clouds have become intermittent, not a whole piece. There is also a shallow blue color at the edge of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a dense sweat on the forehead of the lightning. Obviously, the high-altitude also had a heavy burden on her coherence barrier. Through the glass window, Tilly I found that there was a piece of hoarfrost on the fuselage. If the other party had been using the magical coherence to slow down her discomfort, I am afraid she could not concentrate on driving the plane as it is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost," Tilly can clearly feel that the thrust of the engine is rapidly weakening. "Just look for a gap here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me!" Mai Hao poked his head and turned into the Hawkeye mode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour or so, she found an excellent point of view - from the gaps in the clouds, just to see the spine of the distant continent A short outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
