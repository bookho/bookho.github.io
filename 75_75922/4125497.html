			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor pressed the doubts in his heart and sat down on the third row of the number 10 according to the seat number indicated on the ticket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the one in Losa..." There was a sudden opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head slightly unexpectedly and found that the other is a woman dressed as a luxurious woman. Unlike Linglong, this person is a veteran of love. At any time, you can show your most attractive side, "Victor Lothar, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A long time to hear about you The name is big," the woman smiled and raised her chest. "My name is Denise Payton, from the morning glow city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was originally Peyton's home. Missy, "Victor suddenly realized, "I didn't expect to see businessmen in the same city in a foreign country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't expect to be there. Here I met the rumored business genius," Dennis pointed to the person beside him. "Introduction, this is the appointment of the ambassador of the morning prince, who invited me to come here."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, I will be lucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After talking with Joel, Victor also met a group of upper-class people in the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As expected, the ability to enter the theater at the premiere is basically non-rich. For example, the audience sitting in the front row are mostly the real powers in the city hall. Listening to the statement of the appointment, their tickets are all donated by His Majesty, and there is no need to pick up a copper eagle. The middle and back row are the merchants and guests from all over the world. He even saw the figure of the Grey Fortune King Duo Troupe in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threshold of forty golden dragons turned the theater into a small banquet. If you can deal with these people, the harvest is worth the last fare. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone arrived, more than a dozen waiters pushed the car out of the other door and put a bag of strange paper bags into the armrests Inside the groove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this something for us?" Linglong curiously picked up a bag and looked around. "Hey, the word written on it seems to be popping... popcorn ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And French fries and milk - so these are all eaten?" Victor noticed that the bag with the word milk was quite Peculiar, it looks like parchment, but it feels soft and soft. It’s just a whole body, and it’s impossible to start. Fortunately, under the large characters, there are also pictures of the access, which has undoubtedly taken into account the initial use of the guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he followed the steps shown, inserting a transparent hose into the top of the bag and sucking the milk inside, he couldn’t help but feel a hard time. Describe the sense of accomplishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really fun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the plain milk in the weekdays, it seems to be a lot sweeter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm reminders, ingenious designs, and packaging that you have never seen before - even if it's water, you can sell it at a good price! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who designed it must be an outstanding businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Victor realized that this is not just for the novelty, but different from the traditional porcelain and glassware that are angular and angular. The bag is obviously very difficult to harm people. This is especially important considering the identity of the viewer. At the same time, the storage slot next to the chair is completely attached to the bag, and even if the unpacked paper bag is placed inside, there will be no slight drop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a mature match is hard to imagine appearing on a new product that debuts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Victor was going to try the taste of the bag of popcorn, an ethereal voice suddenly sounded above the hall. "Welcome to the Grey Fortress." The Magic Theater, "Wolf Heart" is about to perform. Please go back to your seat and listen carefully to the filming rules. If you encounter any problems during the filming process, please follow the code to avoid accidents. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
