			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheng Yan feels someone is calling him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, wake up..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t leave his head, but the sound still didn’t go away It is getting bigger and bigger. He felt someone pull his hand over and gently pulled his sleeve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, His Royal Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheng Yan stunned his eyes and the familiar screen disappeared. The desk was gone, and the walls covered with paper strips were gone. Instead, there was a weird view of the low-rise masonry house, the circular plaza that rushed over the head, and the door-type gallows that were erected in the middle of the square. He sat on the high platform opposite the square, not under the buttocks, but a cold, hard iron chair. There was a circle of people sitting around, staring at him intently, and several of the women dressed as ghostly medieval ladies were covering their mouths and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this ghost place? Shouldn't I be rushing to the progress of the drawings? Cheng Yan’s mind was in a state of turmoil. Working overtime for three consecutive days brought his spirit and body to the limit. He only remembered that he couldn’t hold it anymore. His heartbeat became fast and slow, and he wanted to rest on his desk for a while...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, please announce the ruling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker is the guy who secretly pulls his sleeve He was old, about fifty or sixty years old, wearing a white robe, and it looked a bit like Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am dreaming? Cheng Ke licked his dry lips, ruling, what ruling? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he soon knew that the people in the square looked at the direction of the gallows, waving their fists, and occasionally one or two stones flew toward the gallows. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheng Yan only saw such an ancient torture tool in the movie - the two columns are about four meters high, the top of the column is framed by a wooden beam, and the middle of the beam is inlaid. The rusty iron ring, the yellowish hemp rope passes through the iron ring, one end is fixed under the gallows, and the other end is placed on the prisoner's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this weird dream, he found that his vision became amazing and easy to use. He usually couldn’t see the words on the display without wearing glasses, but now Every detail on the gallows, fifty meters away, can be seen clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoner with a hood, his hands tied behind his back, the rough gray singles dirty like a rag. The body is thin, and the exposed ankle seems to be pinched off by hand. The front chest is slightly bulging and it seems to be a famous woman. She shivered in the wind, but still tried to stand up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this guy is guilty of blasphemy, so that so many people are waiting for her to be hanged? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking just now, the memory in Cheng Yan’s mind seems to be suddenly connected, and the answer comes to me at almost the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a "witch." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incarnation by the devil and degeneration, the incarnation of the unclean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness?" Gandalf cautiously urged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He glanced at the other side, hey, it’s not called Gandalf, Barov is his real name, the assistant of the Finance Minister, was sent to handle it for himself. Government affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And himself, the four princes of the Greysburg Kingdom, Roland, came here to graze. The residents of Bianbu Town caught the witch and immediately sent it to the police station. No, it was sent to the trial center. The warrant of the execution of the witch is usually issued by the local lord or the bishop. Since he is in power here, the issuance of the warrant has become a matter of division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Record presents the questions he needs most to answer, without screening or reading, as if this was his own experience. Cheng Yan was confused for a moment, absolutely no dream can do such details, then, is this not a dream? He crossed the dark ages of Europe in the Middle Ages and became Roland? From a drawing dog that has been working overnight, has become a four-prince prince? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the kingdom of the kingdom seems so poor and backward, the name of the Grey Fortress Kingdom has never been seen in history books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to go through this unscientific thing can be studied later, but this farce must be terminated. It is the normal state of uncivilized civilization to attribute the disaster to some poor ghosts, but it is necessary It is unacceptable to hang people to meet the dark mentality of the onlookers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed Barry’s hand and threw it on the ground and stretched out. “Sleepy, and sentenced again, it’s gone today! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheng Yan does not act recklessly, but carefully recalls the prince's style of acting in memory, and reproduces the kind of enthusiasm that goes its own way. Yes, the four princes are so fucked, their character is bad, and they think of one out. In other words, I can count on how good a prince is in his early twenties and no one can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocrat who sat on the high platform looked strange and surprised, but a tall man wearing a armor stood up. "His Highness, this is not a joke." Once the identity of the witch is confirmed, it should be executed immediately. Otherwise, what should the other witches take to rob her? The church knows that it will not sit idly by."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter. Lannis, this decent man is actually his chief knight. Cheng Yan frowned. "Why, are you afraid?" The naked sarcasm in his speech is not entirely acting. A strong man with a thicker arm than his body is worried about being jailed by the other party. Is the witch a spokesperson? "How many more than one net is not better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that he no longer speaks, Cheng Yan waved his hand and called the guard to take him away. Carter hesitated, or kept up with the team and walked on the side of the four princes. Other nobles got up and bent down to pay tribute, but Cheng Yan's afterglow can see the unsightly contempt in this group of people's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the palace - that is, in the castle south of Bianbu Town, the guardian guarded the anxious ministerial assistant outside the hall, he was a little loose A tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a person who deals with computers for 90% of the time, it is super-level to play in front of everyone. Cheng Yan found his bedroom according to the position in the memory, and sat down on the bed for a while before suppressing the intense heartbeat. The most important thing at the moment is to make the situation clear. As a prince, don't stay in Wangcheng, what are you doing in this ridiculous place? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t want to be okay, my thoughts just came out, and he was stunned by the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland. Wimbledon actually came for the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origin of everything comes from the wonderful purpose of the king of the Grey Fort, Wimbledon III: To inherit this kingdom, not the first born prince has the highest order right But the person with the best ability to govern the country can be in charge. He sent the five children of adulthood to various territories under the rule of law. Five years later, he decided to establish a prince according to the level of governance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to live, plus equality between men and women, sounds like a very advanced concept, the problem is that the actual implementation is completely different. Who can guarantee that the opening conditions of the five people are the same? This is not a real-time strategy game. As far as he knows, the territory acquired by the second prince is much better than that of Bianbu Town. Well, as such, there seems to be no worse place among the five people than Bianbu Town. It is a bad start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, how to evaluate the level of governance, population? military? economic? Wimbledon III did not mention any standards and did not impose any restrictions on competition. What if someone had to play the assassination in private? Was the Queen watching her son killing each other? Wait... He thought about it carefully, and it’s a bad news. The queen passed away five years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheng Yan sighed, obviously this is a brutal and dark feudal era, from the hunter-hunting witch can see one or two, wearing a prince is already very high The starting point. Besides, even if he does not get the throne, he is still the blood of the king of the gray castle. As long as he can survive, the land is also considered a lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And...what can you do with the king? Without the Internet, without the nourishment of modern civilization, he would like to be like this group of indigenous people, nothing to burn a witch, live in a city where the feces are dumped at will, and finally die from the black death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheng Yan suppresses the chaotic thoughts in his heart and walks to the floor mirror in the bedroom. The person in the mirror has a light gray curly hair, which is the most vivid of the gray castle royal family. feature. The five senses are still correct, that is, there is no formality in the face, and there is no temperament. His face was slightly pale and lacked exercise. As for whether or not he was addicted to wine, he recalled that it seems to be okay. There are several lovers in Wangcheng, all of which are voluntary, and have not done anything to force others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
