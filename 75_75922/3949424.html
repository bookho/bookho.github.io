			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first batch of wheat planted in Bianbu Town finally ushered in the harvest day. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serfs were burning the sun, cutting the straw with a sickle, bundled and transported to the other side of the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows that it is a very cumbersome process from wheat to wheat. Before the mechanical tools and combine harvesters are yet to become popular, the grain needs manual separation. , cleaning, screening, drying. Now, he has witnessed this process again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the straw was returned to the camp, the serfs spread them flat on the ground and then used various tools - what is the use of everything: sticks, Stones and scorpions are all in battle, repeatedly hitting the straw and wheat ears, and letting the fruit go out of the outer shell. This process usually lasts for three or four days. In Roland's memory, the countryside uses cows or scorpions, pulling the stone to crush in the valley, not only saves a lot of effort, but also has a much better shelling effect than the beat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that the agricultural level of the town is really too backward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the game is over, it is also used. If you don’t have a fork, use a wooden stick instead, or grab the straw directly with your hands and throw it at the sky. It is like cooking in a pan. After the previous knock, most of the shells of the caryopsis have been broken, and the process is to separate the fruit from the ears of wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheat straw after threshing actually has many functions. It can be returned to the field after crushing, can be used as livestock bedding, and can also be used for making feed and paper, but Roland is not at the moment. When the time was to show the green industry, I had to watch the serfs pile up the wheat straws on the riverside and unify the fire. In the next few days, the gray smoke was flying all over the town, which was comparable to the previous cement powder pollution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the two spindle islands of Chishui Bridge have also been cleaned up and the construction of the retaining wall is being carried out as planned. The foundation pier is the same prefabricated way as the main bridge. First, the concrete column containing the steel and steel bars is poured out in the open space, and then the “lifting and hoisting” is carried out. Finally, the lotus is responsible for sinking it into the soil, only the half is exposed. Steel plate, waiting to be connected to the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this week, Roland basically swayed between Chishui Bridge and the valley, and the skin was sunburned a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the wheat straw was forked, there was only one layer of grain and chaff left in the valley. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serfs swept them together and piled them into small hills, then stood on the mountain bag, shoveling the mixture with a shovel and throwing it toward the open space ahead. Because the chaff is much lighter than the fruit, the distance from the wind is farther away, so the grain is scattered under the feet, and the shells and debris are scattered in the distance - everyone is doing this step by step. Collect food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s impossible to completely clean the chaff, and this process will also make the grain mix with mud and sand, so Roland It is a good idea to wait until the harvest day next year, he must prepare a batch of mechanical tools in advance - the combine harvester is estimated to be impossible, but the shelling machine is still very easy to achieve, but the stone mill is replaced by a grinding disc And install a screen below and separate the broken chaff with a blower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a full grain of wheat is evenly laid on the valley, it seems to have dyed a layer of gold on the northern shore of the entire Chishui River. Looking at these golden fruits, Roland is filled with a sense of accomplishment. Regardless of the harvested food enough to fill the stomach of more than 10,000 people, at least for Bianbu Town, this is a memorable day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From today, the food in his territory will gradually shift from being completely dependent on imports to self-sufficiency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After three days of drying, the wheat entered the bagging and weighing stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, this time is a big harvest!" In the afternoon, Barov rushed into the office, "according to the preliminary statistics of the City Hall, The yield of the block responsibility field is at least four times that of the previous one, and the highest is currently six times. So, this year's harvest is enough to fill the stomach of the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Roland couldn’t help but smile. "It seems that the new granary in the castle area is not always empty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Do you know what it means?” The look of the town hall manager seems to be more exciting than him. “The town needs only two more 5,000 farmers to meet the food consumption of 50,000 to 60,000 people! This is incredible. The town can be expanded into the largest city in the Grey Fort, no...” He paused, “the most magnificent city on the Big 6!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
