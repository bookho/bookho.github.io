			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, trapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakirith is gradually thinking about it. At that time, it was tracking the undulations of the stocks, and continued to go deeper into the lower level of consciousness. After crossing the shallow and deep dividing lines, consciousness would become difficult, not only against the turbulent turbulence, but also its resistance. It will suddenly increase, as if it is struggling in the quagmire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the first time to enter such a deep field, every move is cautious, if you lose your way, the end is likely to never leave. If it weren't for the feeling of the volatility, the more it became apparent, it wanted to interrupt the search several times, and returned to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the locked area is getting smaller and smaller, and finding the entrance is a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it decided to stick to it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is that Hecksod seems to be dissatisfied with the way he has closed his eyes in the Dianchi Lake, especially since the birth tower has been successfully transplanted. Humans have not reacted yet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that it also wants to make it clear as soon as possible whether the changes in human beings have anything to do with inheritance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris did not expect it, just as it moved closer to the source of the volatility, the conscious community suddenly had a strong tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling is like the mud instantly turns into a waterfall, or there is a huge crack under the foot, the thick deep layer collapses down, it struggles If there were no chances, they would be involved in the turbulent flow. When they woke up, they found this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that this should be part of the ideology, but it is not related to the male human being, but it is uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the corner of the window, Wakiris can see an extremely wide city, comparable to the towers of the birth tower, and look at it at a glance Not at the end, even the king's "master of the Holy See" is also eclipsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that makes it suspicious is that if the place is really the field that the male has developed, the other party should be aware of the intruder at the moment it is involved. presence. The creator of the field has the power of omnipotence, and it is the deadly enemy of mankind. The other party cannot be indifferent until now. Looking at it from another angle, if a witch's consciousness accidentally breaks into the dominion, I am afraid that death is the most benevolent ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is, if this field has nothing to do with the male, then where can it be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the shock comes, it is indeed above the source of the wave, unless it finds the wrong clue at the beginning, otherwise it can't think of anything else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakirith thought for a long time and couldn’t figure out what to do, just throwing these questions behind him - since you can’t get an answer, it’s no good to think about it. . In an unfamiliar environment, adapting to a new body as soon as possible will have the opportunity to get out of trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing is certain, its new body is far weaker than before, and the injuries to the legs have not recovered, showing that the healing power is extremely low, plus The magic barrier does not work, and this feeling of no precaution has not been experienced for a long time. It seems to have returned to the beginning of the promotion ceremony, the era when anyone can pose a threat to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, it still uses magic and has a good power, which is somewhat similar to the supernatural in the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Wakiris was checking his own state, footsteps suddenly sounded outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was pushed open and the two humans came in with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It almost subconsciously wants to fly up, the future will be torn in half, and when the elbow is lifted in half, the hard life will be suppressed by the will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the real world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reminds itself that when it first stunned, it seemed that humans saved it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the spirit is quite good, Miss Wakiris." The female opened the corner of the quilt and checked all the feet that were entangled in it. "It’s not a martial art... it’s so big. I didn’t hurt my bones. If I changed to me, I’m afraid that both legs will be crushed into pieces.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is there such a thing in front of the patient? "The male took a look at the former and then looked at it. "I am your doctor. Just call me a high doctor. From the X-ray, you are only a matter of time. Don't worry, as long as you nurse, you will not It will affect the future martial arts competition. Any other uncomfortable place can tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party’s words are mostly unintelligible, and the best way to deal with it is to have fewer openings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it notes that these human attitudes are very friendly, not like looking at a different kind of expression, which makes it quite puzzled. Even if there is no hostility, the differences between the two ethnic groups are extremely different. How can such an equal conversation be possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris even noticed that the female seemed to be particularly interested in it, and the eyes had never left its body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is the best." The male who claimed to be a high-ranking doctor turned over the booklet. "The association has a condolence arrangement in the afternoon. I have already helped you to get rid of the meeting. The group of people is really true. They all hurt like this. I want you to go to a wheelchair. It’s just a mess. But there is no way to refuse the condolence. This hospital is a martial artist. It’s basically impossible for the association to start, and it’s basically impossible to let them in. Fortunately, you only have to lie down.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...Thank you.” It mimics the human tone. Go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're welcome." The male smiled. "Yes... It’s boring to sit here. After all, the association didn’t take the phone when you sent it. It’s also brought together, or will it be boring if you watch TV?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile? TV? What are these things? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakirith was dumb and didn’t know what to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the other party used its silence as the default, picking up a small box on the bedside table and fiddling twice against the blackboard on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the blackboard is actually emitting light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then rest well." The high doctor waved his hand and left the room with the female. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiri looked at the scene on TV with a stunned look and almost failed to maintain his image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...how to do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture in the blackboard has been changed and changed, whether it is a person or a thing, it is vivid in the inside. If it uses magic, it is nothing strange, but it is not a magical creation. From beginning to end, it does not feel a magical fluctuation inside the blackboard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took a while for Wakiri to adapt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It found that the content displayed on the TV was related to the small box. Just press the "Direction" button above and the TV will show something different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it doesn't make a mistake, the content is probably related to the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an effective way to understand the strange world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as it keeps looking through it, a special word breaks into its ears - the "War Taoist Association." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysis of the rhetoric of the male human before, it seems to be a member of the association, or was mistakenly recognized as a member of the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a floating space on the TV. The angle of view is from the sky and should be a magical creation like flying magic stone. To. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
