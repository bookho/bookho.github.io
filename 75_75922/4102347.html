			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not the pope, the Pope has already been -" Isabella just wanted to deny, but was stopped by Ai Gesha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The task is important, you won't mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seemingly unrelated words Isabella instantly understood the meaning of the other party. She also knew that this method was more convenient, but for the king who valued power, this was a dangerous signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling what I saw and heard in the absence of Winter City, she hesitated after a moment of hesitation, and refused to resign it. "What do you mean by saving you? Judgment Where are the samurai and the priests?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They ran!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, some People are called away by the Holy City!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We committed crimes and killed the priests..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not her fault!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No food, no clothes... No replenishment for two months, have we been abandoned?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What a stupid thing, isn’t it coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene suddenly sounded for a while A replied voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything is quiet!" Isabella was impatient. "A person can say it." She swept the crowd and reached out to the leading nun. "You come first, stand up and say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty." The nun first respectfully touched the ground and struggled to climb from the ground. "The last time I received the news from Hermes, it was more than a month ago..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Isabel Pull finally got a general understanding of what happened here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Cold War Ridge, the supply of the monastery has gone from bad to worse. At the beginning, the food was shrunk, and the number of times was reduced by half. Since the three courtyards are all closed management, the news is all based on the outside world, and the order is still stable. The priests and trial warriors stationed in the camp encouraged everyone to pray and live through this predicament with a strong attitude, saying that the situation will soon turn better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called final message of the other party is that the church took away all the judges and priests a month and a half ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuns are not sure what order they received, only knowing that those who have not been transferred out of the hall are ashamed, like losing The soul is general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monastery became a place of catastrophe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the principle of automatic replacement, they are self-proclaimed as new priests, but they no longer lead everyone to pray, nor are they willing to follow the predecessor’s contraction diet system. . Not only did they enjoy the few foods in the warehouse without restraint, but they further deducted the food of the orphans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the nuns went to talk, they learned of a devastating news, that is, the collapse of the Cathedral of Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church has reached the end of its life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to fight the enemy, the high-level decision to abandon the old holy city and return all the staff to the plateau. The last order left to the monastery is to resist the enemies of the invasion and to dedicate life to the gods until the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these changes sound unbelievable, the passage of the passage connecting the reflection church seems to verify their claims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faced with this bad news, the nuns also split into two factions, some people were completely disappointed, joined the "new priesthood faction", and others were hesitant I don’t know what to do. According to the lead nuns, the church used to be so powerful, so strong that they hardly need to think about it, and never considered their own destiny... Because of this, the news almost completely plunged them into chaos. It is as if the world known in the past suddenly collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
