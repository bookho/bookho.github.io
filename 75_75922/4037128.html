			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light penetrates into the dark, the blurred vision adapts to the light source, the first thing that comes to mind is the white ceiling - the Luo orchid takes a few seconds to get rid of the wake up Stunned, the more he became clear as the field of vision became clear, the more he felt uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is it here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat up so hard that he actually slept in a modern bedroom-like room with a soft bed underneath, placed on the side of the bed Table lamp and paper, and the other side is a reddish brown wardrobe. The glare of the sun shone through the blinds and poured evenly on the mat and his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell! Is this fight not finished yet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleepiness in Roland’s brain suddenly disappeared without a trace. He rolled down from the bed and reached out to summon a self-defense gun, but for a long time. The hands are still empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but sink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could it be... the battlefield rules have changed again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be a hassle. With the skill and degree of the pure man, he barely competed with his bare hands and only had a beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, what is the most profound scene in memory as a battle platform? He didn't have any impression of this damn room! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland walked lightly to the bedroom door and put his ear on the door panel for a moment, and there was an intermittent sound coming out of the door. It seemed that someone was talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully held the doorknob and opened the door with a slit - outside was a more spacious room, and the display was like a living room. Beside the empty sand, the old desktop fan is shaking his head and making a sound. In front of the sand is a coffee table and a wall-mounted TV. The picture is still flashing, and the voice should be from there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, no one in the living room can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is too much too strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took a deep breath and walked slowly into the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red ribbon on the fan cover is drifting in the wind, and the cool breeze makes him feel refreshed - then he noticed that there was something in the room. The sultry, and the resounding humming outside the window also means that the world is in the midsummer season. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few magazines scattered on the sand, and Roland has picked up a copy of it, the content is actually fashion news and constellation divination, the style is very immature, simply It was like watching a little girl with no hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brow wrinkled deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible for him to buy such a book, either in his previous life or in this life. Obviously this room does not belong to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the news on TV attracted Roland’s attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the evening of the evening, a student of the city had an unexplained explosion, and a school building was damaged. The photos from the scene can be seen, the entire roof. It’s all collapsed, and there are scattered glass fragments everywhere. What caused this? Now let us contact the reporters at the scene.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t help but grow up Mouth, I can hardly believe my eyes--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon everyone, my current location is next to the teaching building where the explosion occurred." A female reporter appeared on the screen, and the building as the background is the battlefield when he fights with the cleansing! "According to the witnesses, the explosions were continuous and the fire illumined half a sky. Fortunately, because of the summer vacation, there were not many students on campus, so no casualties were caused. The police have now The campus was completely blocked, and the students who stayed in the school also moved to the nearby hostels and were looked after by the teachers. However, the cause of the explosion has not been ascertained so far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What do you think of this accident?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," the host nodded. "Next, please read the next news. Summer is hot and the heat is hard to bear. Students should enjoy long-lost holiday life at home instead of participating in various extracurricular tutoring. The Education Department has already banned classes. If you have this kind of situation, you can call the report number..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content behind Roland did not listen at all, his teaching is all in his head The scene of the collapse of the building - the battle of the soul should not be a fictional illusion! How can this be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After standing for a long time, he suddenly realized what he was, hurried to the front of the living room door, opened the security door, and a heat wave suddenly poured into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a modern city that appears in front of him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall buildings in the distance are one after another, connected into a dense concrete jungle, not far from the busy streets, the cars and pedestrians are constantly coming and going; and the position where he stands Probably on the walkway of an apartment building, I looked back and saw that the material of the low-end door panel was hung with the o825 gold nameplate. If there is no mistake, this should mean the eight-story twenty-fifth room. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trouble let, don't block the aisle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is a little bit stunned, Turning around, the neighbor's door is not known when it has been opened. A middle-aged woman is staring at him impatiently - until she leans over, the other person snorted and walked past him, while drifting into the nose. There is also a rich inferior perfume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's true, it won't work during the day, and you can run around in a vest crotch. It's not too shameful to be old." The other person seems to be Speaking to himself, the sound just happens to float into Roland's ear, and this skill is already handy for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland returned to the house and slammed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jie Luo! You give me out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t waste time hiding "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the trick of your new design? Put things in my head to the east?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't laugh at the dead, but it's just some illusion!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, there was still no movement in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland grabbed the glass on the coffee table and slammed it on the wall, and the cup was instantly split. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way you will not let me go? He sneered in his heart and wanted to trap me forever in this consciousness? You can't shut me down, Jieluo! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without hesitation, he immediately acted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming this is another illusion similar to the battle of the soul, how can we get out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suicide is definitely the last option, and Roland decided to start with a simple one - make a fall together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved a few chairs, stacking them from big to small, and the back of the chair was against the sand, so even if it failed, it would not hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the erection, he stepped on the constantly swaying chair and slowly climbed to the highest point, when his head almost slammed against the ceiling and turned his back to the top. It is really scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now Roland has experienced death, or changed to a trick, this psychological barrier is hard to beat him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he rocked the chair back and forth, the sound of unlocking sounded outside the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the real owner of this room coming back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a solid body in the future, the stacked chairs have crashed down--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the rush of falling, Roland tried to lean over and saw a young girl walking outside the door. She was carrying a shoulder bag and was about eleven years old, but the long white and light red eyes made him recognize immediately. The other party! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
