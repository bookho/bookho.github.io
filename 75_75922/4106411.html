			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s never a problem to solve the Lord of the Morning, the question is how to control the order of the morning kingdom, if the followers are still Moya or support the royal family People, then this action can't achieve the purpose that should be. You should be very clear about this truth." Roland looked directly at Andrea's eyes and went on to say, "My original involvement would make this sweeping righteous. But now I am afraid I have to let the three families come to Taiwan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is very simple, someone must take over the city of Huiguang after the fall of Ampein Moya The chaotic political situation, and the name of the king of the Grey Fort and the strength of the First Army is enough to convince all the aristocrats who want to move, even if the rank of Queen Quinn is regent, it will be regarded as the spokesperson supported by the Wimbledon royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new plan, this major premise of the involvement of the gray fort has been difficult to achieve, and the punishment of the witch itself is not a political force, so it can only be summarized into three In the name of the big family, otherwise the diplomatic war will become a retaliatory assassination, which is absolutely to be avoided by Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program has advantages and disadvantages for the Quinn family. The downside is that it needs to be the target of the public. The advantage is that the prestige will multiply if he can take the opportunity to control it. Glow City, the regent spokesperson will have the opportunity to become the real new dawn king. Considering the power of Count Quinn himself, it should be that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia hesitated for a while and quickly figured out the key points. "You can do this... the benefits you get are very limited." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s better than letting Anpein continue to be right with me. If you don’t help, you can save Otto’s life.” Roland is undecided, “as I was before. As mentioned above, I will not easily give up anyone who has contributed to the Grey Fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out...I understand," Her look relaxed and she was grateful. "Miss Itis is not wrong, you are a benevolent king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Um... Hey?” Roland gave a glimpse, “Itis Kant? What did she say?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey, her statement is the same as yours— - Before the expedition, she knew that you would definitely lend a helping hand to Sir Otto. In fact, if it is not the persuasion of the North Pearl, I am afraid I will not make a decision so quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is such a thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pretended to be quiet and nodded. "In this case, I will write a letter to Count Quinn, in addition to the action steps. It also represents the covenant of the Grey Fort. Although most people will make the right choice, I hope that the result is 100%, so you have to go to the Glow City with the god witch and make sure he acts according to the plan I said. To be honest, I trust you, not your father, Quinn, so you can only stay here for a while. Of course, once the problem is solved, you can return to the winter with the witches." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After laying down his concerns, Andrea regained the elegance of the nobility. She lifted the skirt and shook her body. "You have done this, I Naturally, I can't resign. In addition, I also have a letter that I want to send to His Royal Highness, and I also ask you to transfer it for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a matter of work," Roland smiled. It should be down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Andrea left, the nightingale frowned. "What kind of ghost is that guy doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you talking about, Itis?" He touched his chin. "Hey... maybe it’s just a chat when I talked about it. After all, both of them have attended the decision-making meeting before the expedition. Why? Can she not think that I am a kind person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel that even if you are a good person in the world, she will not praise you so much." The nightingale shrugged. "She is not like a person who will mention kindness..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is also ready to say something, the guard outside the tent I opened the curtain and reported, "Your Majesty, Isis Kant wants to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh? This is a bit interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the nightingale and then promised, "Please come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
