			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has recently been immersed in a happy mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sitting alone in the office, he will occasionally slap two small songs, and recall the good times in the hot air balloon basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna’s eyes closed and the look of the kiss was so cute, just thinking about it would make him unable to hold his mouth. And the most important thing is the meaning of her words, which have revealed the hot emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing he could do at the time was to respond to her more enthusiastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of landing, Roland felt that his lips were faintly painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably a kiss that was too long for her to breathe poorly, and used teeth when she was in a panic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, this feeling has not been experienced for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When life is close to a quarter, the skills that appear in TV movies and novels have finally come into use, and the objects are still so beautiful. Miss Anna, Roland feels that she has finally taken the first step in winning the life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfied with a breath, he reached into the drawer and wanted to chew snacks to calm the joy, but the result was empty - these beef jerky is clearly I only put it in yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked back at the nightingale by the window, which whistled and pretended to look at the scenery casually. I specially changed the dried fish into beef jerky, just to prevent the nightingale from stealing. I didn’t expect her to come to the beef jerky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, footsteps sounded outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, Sir Barov is seeking to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale did not hide the figure as usual, but pulled down the hood and sat down on the recliner seat near the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant of the minister pushed in and saw other people in the office. He later stunned, but quickly recovered his normal look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Highness, this month's demographics have been made." He handed a roll of parchment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So fast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the registration file of the people, it is now more convenient "The minister's assistant laughed. "Your previous decision was a wise move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, now they are starting to flatter...Roland spreads the paper roll, I saw that according to the different occupations of the people in Bianbu Town, it will be arranged at a glance. Compared with the report that did not even divide the paragraph when it was just crossed, Barov’s ability has also made substantial progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first line is also the largest group, serfs, currently a total of 3,628 people (including family members). There is also a line of notes underneath: the number of serfs engaged in farming is 1,500. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, is the population of farming a little too small?" Barov pointed to the first article, "According to the Ministry of Agriculture’s Seny Erie estimates If you want the town to stop importing food, I am afraid that it will have to double the farmland and manpower to meet the food needs of Bianbu Town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roland had some impressions of the name of Sene, and should be a knight of the wolf family. The 1,500 people who were engaged in farming were the first group of serfs that were sent, and the subsequent batches were transferred to the mine or Karl's construction team by Roland – they also got the same guarantee, as long as they worked hard for a while. Time can be promoted to free people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't plan to do food self-sufficiency this year. Now there are a lot of wheat stored in the castle warehouse, enough for two or three months. And, this year's new The wheat that is planted is not the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not the same?" Barov stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
