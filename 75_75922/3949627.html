			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Axia is right... don't worry," Wendy stepped forward and took her hand. "The witch alliance is not what your family thinks, you too. It doesn't have to stay in the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" she whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is true," Wendy smiled. "We live in the castle because there is nowhere else to go... before the Highness did not contain us, All witches live a life of wandering, the family is either fragmented, or the sisters are strangers, so you have a family that belongs to you, and you are already lucky enough." She paused, " Let's go, it's big here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... um," the girl lowered her head and followed her into the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the newly awakened witch?" The book has already been waiting at the door. "What is the name?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Axia." Wendy looked at the guard. "Can you help me to inform Ms. Ai Gesha and let her go back to the castle? It is said that the town has a new witch. She should now In the chemical laboratory by the river."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am happy to help you," the guard turned and left after the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed, if Nightingale and Sylvie are not there, only Aegis can distinguish the type and size of the magic," the book nodded. "Her ability is What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not knowing,” Wendy touched her head. “How old are you this year.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten...18 years old." Probably seeing a few strangers in front of her, she was a little nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"18 years old?" Speer said differently. "Is that already adult?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "When did you find yourself awakening as a witch?" asked the book, "Let us explain the process in detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On... ... three days ago, on the adult night," Axia replied in a fine voice. "My brother took a fish from the river and wanted to give it to me. I was taken away by the second sister. I only left half of my tail for me." I cried for a night with my quilt at night, and dreamed that the fish had returned to the bowl. When I woke up, I found that the fish was still there, and I had an older sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"More than one sister... What do you mean?" Wendy was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A second sister sat at the table eating fish, and a second sister was scared on the ground, but soon the fish and the second sister disappeared..." Axia recalls, "I was able to feel that...the extra things should be related to me. But when I told them, I was beaten by my father and said that I should not scare my second sister. I really haven't. Deliberately scare her, who knows that dreaming will become true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is not a dream," Wendy affirmed, "but awakened Calling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the magic is brought together in the witch, it is also the so-called awakening day. In the process, the witch can not only feel the vision of changes in the body. And because most people can't suppress the strange magic, it will also lead to spontaneous ability to display. So the main reason for the loss of witches in the past, apart from the extremely difficult adult days, the second is the awakening day - the unconscious masses show the singular effect of magic, and everyone knows what will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the awakening day and the adult day are exactly the same day, but it is a situation that Wendy has never seen before. Of course, this is not impossible, because the adult day itself is more special. The awakening day is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Later, the second sister said that I am a witch, can no longer stay at home, my brother said that the witch has anything to do, there are so many witches in the town, The family had a fight for this..." As I said later, Axia’s voice was getting lower and lower. "In the end they decided to send me here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp It seems that even the southerners who have just arrived here have already begun to be influenced by the propaganda of the town. Fortunately, she will not be tied up to the church like many sisters. Unfortunately, the family is always unable to complete Accept a witch. But Wendy believes that such things will change over time... the town's locals are the best example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
