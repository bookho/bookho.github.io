			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...the god of imprints! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night eyes widened, no, she did not see the star of the magic stone being lit, but a huge, dark black hole formed in the hands of the enemy - - This is its own ability! The magic of the scorpion is constantly inhaled by the black hole, like a sharply expanding vortex. It can be seen from the appearance of other witches that they have closed their eyes, but in the fog, it is getting darker and darker! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the devil then forced the sword to the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark wave is centered on it, sweeping through the woods in an instant - in an instant, the magic shines like a candle swaying in the wind, shaking two times All went out. The foggy world was broken again. Not only that, but the heart of the forest was also erased. The leaves and Iphi were forcibly pulled out of the trunk and fell heavily on the ground. Especially the former, when the ground fell to the ground, the mouth slammed the blood, and the station could not stand up for a while, obviously it was not hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sees the hustle and bustle of the woods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... The nightingale shook his head, and the leaves were very covert as soon as possible, but it’s not surprising to see the difference from the air. What’s really hard to understand is the way it cracks! It is clear that the magic is released. Why is the glory the same as the stone of God? Even the effect is comparable to the god stone, even more flexible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now is not the time to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She puts on a new bomb nest, forcing the discomfort of the ability to be interrupted, and rushing toward the devil - obviously the shock just now is only a prelude to the enemy. It has turned to the leaves that are not moving, and the latter has almost no resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching to ten meters, the nightingale quickly pulled the trigger - only within this distance, she was sure to hit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's armor arm shot Mars and blue smoke, it didn't seem to think that someone could interfere with himself at this time, an angry scream, the big sword Blocked in front of you. The nightingale suddenly fell a half in the heart, the bullet did not penetrate the arm as usual, and then penetrated into the body, directly smashing its chest into a porridge, even if there is no breakdown of the armor is not clear, as for the blue sword of the door panel It is even more hopeless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five rounds of bullets were shot, and the nightingale pulled out the dagger and leaped to the head of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can't hold back its actions here, the leaves will be unrecoverable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red light in the devil’s eyes is so strong that it cuts the sword obliquely, not so fast as a normal person can do – and the other’s reaction In the nightingale's expectation, she greeted the blade and saw that it was about to be split into two. The fog emerged again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the light ripples can eliminate the power effect in a wide range, but can not ban the magic, the chaotic cyclone returns to stability, you can re-apply ability - this point It is well known for the nightingale that can observe the flow of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outline of the giant sword in the black and white world was instantly distorted. She found the "breakpoint" on the blade at the fastest speed, and "passed through" the thick side. The sword front will tie the dagger to the gap of the devil helmet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only heard the "when" sound, the dagger broke down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s actually...the magic barrier? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, how many abilities it has! ? The nightingale pulled back and slammed back, and the armor that had come back to the gods followed, and swept the sword again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reinvented her skills, but this time she was not so lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil is waving his sword while reaching out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale that is crossing the blade is forcibly dragged out of the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of returning to reality, the blade has a small half left in her body - a bloody light flies out, and a long wound appears in her waist. Roja's protective clothing was also torn from the inside out. The night screamed, and couldn’t care about the tingling from the waist. After landing, I borrowed my strength and tried to avoid the other side’s attack. Unfortunately, the devil’s step was more than two meters, and it was no less than the same. The swiftness of the extraordinary witch, such evasion is completely futile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the magical cage of Effie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crush it!" shouted the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't do it!" Effie bit his teeth. "It's too much strength!" Her fist was completely closed, but the light column could not shrink further. Instead, it trembled as if it were going to break up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy made a deafening roar, his hands raised, and he smashed his prison, and he could lift the sword in the future, and another circle of light was set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let Ann... Miss Na uses the golden thunder...fast!" said Efe, word by word, from the perspective of her face, such a cage insisted It won't be long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the distance between the devil and Effie is very close, and there is no doubt that the divine signature will cover both of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's now!" Anna, who was far away from the night, shouted, "Activate the seal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The line of sight is opposite, Anna immediately understood her thoughts and lifted the metal piece in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a golden glow in the woods, and the sky shone with the light--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil 嚎Screaming, it has probably seen such a scene, the original angry tone contains a hint of fear, and the extent of the struggle is even more intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tricks of the other party’s ability to disperse cannot be used continuously, and the Nightingale realizes that this may be their only chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a series of thunder, God is coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night licks the wound, unfolds the fog, and when the dark thunder is about to fall to the top of the head, the body appears behind Iphi, and her hands clasp her, Do not stop, and jump to one side at the same time - the whole movement in one go, two steps will pull her out of the scope of the attack of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move requires not only will and courage, but also Anna’s cooperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the latter controls the magical power, the first road will be thundered in a slightly forward position, and subsequent bombardment will seal off both of them. Retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night believes that Anna can do it - no one can do better than her in the control of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts also prove this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground of the high-order devil standing is covered with golden light, and the weeds and vines are also turned into fly ash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny swayed twice, and could no longer hold the weak body, and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna!" The leaves finally recovered a little strength and stumbled toward her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She's fine, but the magic is exhausted!" The night screamed, every time she said a word, she felt the pain of tearing her waist - unfortunately Fortunately, although the wound is quite scary, it does not have deep organs. As long as it does not continue to exercise vigorously, the wound will rupture and there is basically no danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...wounded," Iphi looked so complicated. "I will help you pack it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale nodded, just about to pick up the robes, and suddenly became a stiff one--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a black figure in the flying dust Go out slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp corners of the devil's helmet broke a few, like a collapsed stone tower, delicate armor covered with cracks and dirt, an arm and a giant sword Missing, but it is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party has resisted this fatal blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil screams - the nightingale is not sure if it is laughing, but can hear the uncontrollable excitement and killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
