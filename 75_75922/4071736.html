			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has always been interested in the central carrier mentioned in the previous talks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined a number of witch souls, at the expense of the mind to obtain the ability to decipher the legacy of the underground civilization, and can only answer yes and no two answers, the beginning This is no different from the dead thing... all this is covered with a mysterious and tragic atmosphere. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when Roland saw the central carrier in the underground secret room of the hall, he couldn’t help but breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a sarcoma much larger than Pasha and others being entangled in layers of iron, and several thick tentacles were even pulled apart, using iron Stud into a wall or ceiling. The damaged epidermis is scarred, and many of the tentacles have traces of breakage. Obviously it is not the first time to be treated like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he remembers correctly, the central carrier is as conscious as the original carrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can feel cold, heat, sweetness, bitterness... and pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Roland couldn't help but frown. "Isn't the souls integrated into the carrier all witches? And one of your three seats, ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eleanor, Your Majesty," Pasha sighed. "This is no choice. The carrier has no power better than the warrior." How low is low, our tentacles can drill through the dirt, and the light wells are excavated above the dome. Naturally, we can attack the enemy and tear the captured prey into two halves. If you don't do this, an unconscious carrier that can move freely, I am afraid It will cause more trouble than a mixed kind of evil beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that...Roland suddenly understood her helplessness, and the sarcoma itself may be underground. The basic unit of warfare. A carrier that is located within the ground and has no ambitions, if it is out of control, poses a great threat to the relics and magic cores. The Tacula survivors apparently could not accept such a risk, and there was no other way than imprisoning it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately knowing that he knows, he still has some embarrassment in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the voluntarily integrated witches gave everything to Takira, but now they can only be trapped in this dark corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably seeing the thoughts in his heart, Pasha’s tone is somewhat grateful and mixed with bitterness. “We also tried to ask them how they feel. But I haven't been able to get an answer—the souls of the fusion can no longer be extracted through the core of the magic, so they will not feel the external stimulation, and they will never know.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Integration with Eleanor is the ultimate destination of every Taqila witch, and we are no exception, so you don't have to worry about it." Elsie, who had been silent for a while, spoke again. Just don't know if it is an illusion, Roland always feels that the other party's voice is no longer as cold as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... probably upgraded from ice level to ice level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But when we asked if we wanted to ban the central carrier, the answer of the three masters was all yes." Sailing added, "If not, we She won’t fix her so thoroughly.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded. “There is a painter named Soroya in the Witch Alliance who can draw flexibility. Strong cloth, and a little girl named Yu Yu, can make the object sticky. If the two abilities work together, it can produce stronger binding force than the iron rope, and it is bound to be bundled in this way, at least not She is full of injuries. If you have no opinions..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, if that’s the case, then it’s great," said Pasha’s head must be slightly Drooping, "Please accept my thanks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, this is just a little effort." Roland waved his hand. "But...the three masters all answered affirmatively." What does it mean? Can it be an expression, is an expression not? Then it should be heard "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This question will let Celine explain it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes In this way, "helping to integrate the companions to alleviate the pain, Sellin is also very excited. She immediately picks up. "The biggest difference between the central carrier and us is that she has three masters who can pass more complex messages without conscious dialogue. , just like I am now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
