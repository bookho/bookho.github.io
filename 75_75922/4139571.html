			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, the Seagull landed slowly on the simple landing site next to the forest terminal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly just got off the plane and saw the ashes waiting on the sidelines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As always, as long as the glider needs to settle here, the other party will always come to see her, even if only a short side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes she will doubt whether the ashes have completed the protection task of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, when I am not there, the leaves will enter the state of the jungle, no one can hurt her in this situation. And every time you are notified The person who arrives is basically her." And the other party always answers this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long will it be waiting today?" When the crowd spread out and only two of them were left, the ashes asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be tomorrow morning." Looking at the familiar smile in her eyes, Tilly did not feel the ease of expectation, after all, without any discussion At the meeting, he praised Haikou, "I will personally convince her." At this moment, there is still some guilty conscience. "There are also Axe and Itis, and the torch action is about to take the final step. There are probably a lot of things to explain here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At night...?" The ashes seem to be calculating. "Then we can go around the camp first. The test fruits of the leaves are very good. When I am in the evening, I will prepare the bonfire and bake some game for you. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once there is time, she will be arranged like this, as if I don't want to waste a second. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time, no, there are a lot of things to be prepared tonight, I am afraid I can’t get out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The ashes suddenly looked like a sigh, and sighed, "Okay... I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this omnipotent extraordinary With such a frustrated mood, Tilly couldn't help but laugh out loudly, and the guilt in her heart suddenly disappeared a lot. "But it's not me, but you - after all, in the next few days, we will all Stay together, not ready to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In order to intercept the devil, the special operations team needs your participation. So you have to pack your luggage tonight, and head to the front line tomorrow morning - of course, take the seagull number." She laughed. "As for the leaves, Roland also I made arrangements, I will explain to her later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Ashes finally reacted, "You can definitely start Tell me these--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly opened her eyes and ignored the other party’s protests. "The grilled game is definitely too late, but it should be no problem to taste the fruit...you Would you like to take me there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes immediately extended her hand to her, "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eating dinner and returning to the camp residence, Tilly told her about the operational plan formulated by the General Staff Department. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to blocking parts, Ashes seems to have long anticipated his mission, but when she mentions the Seagull as a backhand, her look Suddenly became serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't tell me, the person driving the Seagull...is you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Li was silent for a moment, then greeted her. "I am the most suitable candidate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Roland clearly promised me to take care of you, absolutely It won't let you approach the battlefield!" Ashes stood up annoyed. "I have to look for him to be right--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He didn't agree." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh--" The ash slammed for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, if there is no return, he is not without the possibility to do so. But as I said before, the Seagull is just a backup. Only when Andrea can't complete the sniper, we will intervene. And what we do is just catch up with the high-level devil and let go of the witch."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this not dangerous enough? You have to face the demon--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know you will say that Tilly reluctantly interrupted. "Do you think that we will go hand in hand with the enemy, surpass it in front of it, then drop at the bottom of its eyes, and then let go of the witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If not, what can I do..." The ash frowned. "The gods will not fly, if they don't let the other party notice the glider and induce it to fight, This hindrance does not have any delay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most critical part of the technique of attracting the enemy is to show So that the enemy can easily gain victories, Kill Devil who otherwise will only accelerate the withdrawal, and the location of their bait placed on itself has a very high risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, Itis can't think as simple as you are." Tilly rolled her eyes. "All the devil's actions are inseparable from the red fog." So we don't have to sway in front of the other side, and we don't need to use the gull as a bait, as long as we solve the enemy's supply troops in advance. The demon must not miss this replenishment, otherwise it will only rely on its own gas canister. It's hard to escape from the plains. In other words, the gods of the witches are completely at ease, forcing the other to fight, and the time difference is enough for me and Wendy to return to safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eddy didn’t think of refutation for a while, hesitated to speak, “But just...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Li shook her head. "I'm not saying that this plan is absolutely safe, but its risks are within the controllable range. I said that the executor is part of the plan, and unless I am stupid to your level, I can make myself In trouble, in fact, this is also the main decision I decided to come to the front. ! Because - because they do not stare at you, my heart simply does not fit ah "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" Your Highness ...... "ashes stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call my name!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"提-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before she finished, Tilly had caught her collar and pulled down, then picked up her feet and kissed her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash suddenly felt a warm touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the impression, this is the first time that the five kings took the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Tilly pushed her away and opened her head slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the swaying candlelight, the ashes saw a reddish tinge on the other's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether it’s on the island or in the winter city, every time you travel, I can only stay where you are, and this return may be In a few days, it may be several months. It was not like this at the beginning - when we were in the old kingdom, we were together wherever we went, why we used to, but now we have to be so cautious? Is it being chased by the church? At the time, is there no risk at all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly paused and looked back at the ashes of the eyes again, this time, she did not avoid," I don't want to wait any longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary person confirmed her will through the gray eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know," the ashes took a sigh of relief, and if they insisted on it, the four people at the Wimbledon family were still somewhat similar. "But there is a condition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not to be reluctant, to meet the devil must be safe, right? Roland, he said it already... Really I am not an idiot. If I have a tendency to judge the situation, I should have been in the normal state..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to say this."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
