			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermes Cathedral Chamber of Secrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the Pope is still vacant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three bishops sit side by side, and it is still Mein’s first opening. “I heard that there is some turmoil in the Wing Dong Kingdom?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Judges stationed there are already dealing with this matter, and the leader of the class is Kobe High Priest." Tafren replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it because of it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you not the ones that have been drawn into the church? Heather whistled. "After the Queen was detained, the nobles joined the church and became the top of the church. It was because of your compromise plan, Master Mayn. They were arrested in the city by the scorpion." The squadron searched, the city Guards turned a blind eye, and the public was unacceptable, which naturally caused a rebound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not my plan, Heather," Mayn Yue Dao, "This is the will of His Majesty the Pope. This way we can get everything in the kingdom in the shortest time, instead of continuing to compete with the nobility. There are also outstanding talents among them. If you come over, it will be great for us. As for the locusts, there is no privilege to inherit the ancestry, and only one generation will be eliminated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, since you are even carrying the Pope Come out, I won't say anything more." Heather shrugged, " Those who violated the reputation of the church must be handed over to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maine looks to Bishop Tefren, who sinks, "I recommend not After dealing with them, after suppressing the unrest, they can put the offenders under house arrest. After they joined the church, they will now move their knives to them, which may cause widespread unrest among the aristocratic class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No!" Heather patted the table. "The rules in the conference must not be violated. Any looting carried out in the name of the church is a felony, and it is me who rules the law and arbitration!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time you want to focus on the big picture..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am talking about the big picture." Heather directly Interrupted Teflon's words, "Don't forget what we are relying on to establish a fair and just image in the winter. If this time is not given a severe blow to those scums, the people of Yongdong will lose confidence in us! This is the foundation of the church - not the damn aristocracy. If you don't agree, ! Consult the Pope directly under the crown "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Pope no time to worry about such things, the foundation of the church is not in the public body, and how that has a powerful force. Mayn sighed and reached out and told Teflon not to be too excited. "Let the Cobh high priest send them back to the new holy city for trial?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, I will go there in person," Heather said. "There has been a lot of work in the recent past. It is expected to be back in two or three months. It is natural that the more people see it, the better." The ice platform of Yongdong Wangdu seems to be a good place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure?" Mayn frowned. "Now there is no extra commander protection." When you go to the winter, if you meet the witches, you are in danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are so many witches," Heather did not take it, "give My team of judges is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you insist." Mayn doesn't want to entangle this topic again. "I have a bad news here. Church The army made an accident when attacking the Broken Fort in the Kingdom of the Wolf Heart, losing more than 20 gods and more than 100 trial troops. "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty more gods?" Teflon blinked. "Who is the conductor?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bell, she is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The commander is dead? It seems that they have really met the challenge. Heather is interested. "After losing so many gods, the Orion adults seem to have a headache."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't blame him, the faulty terrain is special, the city gate opens In the middle of the mountain, there are three feet (about 1 meter) high from the ground. They destroyed the wooden bridge into the door and used some of the alchemists' things.” Mayn explained, “It is reported that they set up the wooden ladder. Afterwards, the gods who had just climbed up had suffered a strange fire attack. First, a lot of white solids were sprayed from the pipes on the city gate. Then the smoke caught fire and the flames stuck to the body. The people are burning. Now they are contacting the church believers in the city to see if they can be inside and outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
