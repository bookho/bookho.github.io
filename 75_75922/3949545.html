			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the darkness dissipated, Mayn found himself standing in an empty square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything in front of you has an impression of deja vu... low-rise houses, monasteries still under construction, and new stone churches. The mud is dry and solid, there is no trace of snow, the sun above the head is in the clouds, and the breeze blowing from time to time is warm and gentle, not like being in the evil moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, he suddenly realized that this is the old holy city when he just became a believer? At the time, in the square, it was the christening ceremony hosted by His Majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The place where you were most impressed is here," said the sound of Jieluo behind him. "It is a really good place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment of the momentary disconnection was all connected, and he felt the anger burst out suddenly, turned around and his eyes pressed against each other, saying one word at a time: Jielu, are you crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dares to use her ability! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, why is the stone of God's punishment that I carry does not work? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know exactly what I am doing," Jielu smiled. "It’s you... I’m afraid it’s still in the dark. It’s okay, here is consciousness. The world, the time is too much to use, I can explain it to you slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul battlefield, Mayn is no stranger to this ability, is being In the world of the eroder, the consciousness alone fights, the winner gets everything, and the loser loses everything. This is also an extremely rare summoning ability. If you do not wear the stone of the gods, it is almost inevitable. But... damn, you clearly wear the stone of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and took out the sky-blue spar from his close-fitting pocket. Under the sunlight, its polygonal outline glowed with a dazzling blue luster. There is nothing unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Mayn gritted his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean the god stone?" Jielu smiled. "It's very simple. Its field tremors have been smoothed out. Of course, for mortals, There is no difference at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tremor is smoothed? The Pope couldn't help but widen his eyes, and he could eliminate the magical effect of the sacred stone. There is only one in the Holy City - the pure Isabella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...** naked betrayal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of damn 婊* children! Mayn felt the blue veins on his forehead, and the anger of his anger made his hands tremble slightly. He had long known that these tools could not be relied on. When they were crowned, they should turn them all into God's fines! Trying to restrain this anger, he hates, "What time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know what she is moving, you are not putting Did I have a good time in the prison?" Jielu shrugged. "I just entrusted her to do this, nothing more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If you are not premeditated for a long time, how can she easily do this kind of blasphemy!" No, he suddenly condensed in his heart, even if they are two, it is impossible to do this... take over the pope After that, he lived in the bedroom that belonged to O'Brien's bedroom. It was not only full of various organs, but also many trial warriors. Not to mention that there are several high-level god stones placed on the bed, and they are used every day. Wherever there are guards, how can she have a chance to start? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Mayn calmed down. "What do you want to do, just to avenge my punishment? Even if you kill me, The entire cave below the basket is the area affected by the god stone. Where can you escape? Once you land, you will be seen by the long-awaited trial army, and then you will be arrested. Don’t think that you can get through the pivotal organs. When they start a torture interrogation, you will find that the whip like a few days ago is like a goose feather."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not going to escape," Shaking his head, "I want to take the place of you, take over the position of the Pope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
