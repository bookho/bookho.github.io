			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, squat, I don't quite understand." Marquis Wick wiped the sweat from his forehead. "What do you mean by obsolete?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gallows, mine labor, fines, and deportation," the prince said lightly. "The rules of the game are in line with the royal law and are very fair."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I have worked for your father, you can't-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am your king now "Yes, so of course," he interrupted. "Don't panic. If the ten questions pass, you can get promotion and rewards. It's interesting to win or lose, right?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...can't accept," Sir Paola shook his head. "This is too much! The punishment you said must be decided by the court. My Majesty, I feel a little uncomfortable. Please let me go first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and wanted to leave the hall, but found that the door had been closed, two Soldiers stood impassively at the outlet, meaning that there is no compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not asking for your opinion, Mr. Paola," Roland said. "If you insist on going, the way to eliminate it is to add one more." ," he made a gesture of shooting, "being killed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles opened their eyes and involuntarily retreated two steps, while the soldiers on both sides Then raised the guns and watched the movements of the group with vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So now, the game begins." Roland stood up and took a clapping. "The first question, forcing refugees everywhere, forcing them to attack the West." Have you been involved? Let's start with you, Mr. Prime Minister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The Marquis of Wick was silent for a moment, "I do have I have been recruiting refugees from the east and south of the country, but I don’t know what you said in the second half of the sentence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland feels the right shoulder Was gently licked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, I told you that there is only one chance," he waved his hand. "Put him down, there is a prison under the hall." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, what I said is true-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, you and I know, Even this sentence is a lie," Roland ignored the complaint of the former prime minister and saw him being dragged down the hall. He slowly said, "If you are a little smarter, don't choose to lie. It is not for you." Benefits - I can distinguish lies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is standing in the same place, no one dares to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If no one takes the initiative to answer, then I will name it," he said unwillingly to the Minister of Justice. "Mr. Paola, what about you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Roland thought, this is a trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had to solve the aristocrats here and he had the energy to deal with the things south of the Dragon. He himself could not stay here for too long, and eventually he had to be managed by the talents of the City Hall to manage the affairs of the city – taking over the resistance of the city, one from the local nobility and the other from the Black Street gang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited by the limited input power, he can't be as thorough as the long song fortress, so it still needs some cooperation with the traditional forces. The purpose of this trial was to quickly eradicate the nobility who had colluded with Tiffco and had a big crime, leaving a small background with a clean background as a partner to maintain the basic operation of the city. As for the black street, you can hand it over to Tassa to coordinate order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the purpose of his decision to launch the spring offensive was to worry that Tiffco was recruiting people and wasting on meaningless war of attrition. If you overthrow Tiffco and leave, the city will certainly fall into chaos in a short time, then he is no different from the pseudo-king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a year of development, Roland’s power is not the same as it was at the beginning, so even though he does not intend to make Wangdu a key city, You don't have to give it to someone else as a fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
