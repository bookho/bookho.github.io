			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, stop---!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin shouted in amazement ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the magic cycle is suspended, the god of God will become a dead mountain with no floating force! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is my ability." Nasopelle said slyly. "Even if there is no body here, I can control the magic distance through the net." Core. It didn't exist at the beginning, but it was created a little bit after I accepted the inheritance. It doesn't need talent support, and it doesn't vary from person to person. Now this net is certainly less than the consciousness, but hundreds. Years, or thousands of years later? To know that I have broken the physical bondage, the most important thing is time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Booming rumbling... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rest of the core, the god of God made a tremor in the interior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers stationed around the promotion square were difficult to stand up for a while, and many people could not fall to the ground and fell directly to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The height of the god of God is falling!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, what happened?" Heikezod shouted at Celine, "Hey, witch! Answer me soon!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mask is interfering with the operation of the core instrument, we have to cut off its connection!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;赛琳After several consecutive voices, she found that the other party simply “listened” to her own consciousness. She could perceive changes in the outside world, but lost the ability to communicate with the outside world, just like a transparent glass wall on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are in the mother of the soul, the carrier is now just an empty shell, how can they hear your reminder?" Said, "And it's so easy to cut off the connection... In my family, the mother of the soul is second only to the king, juxtaposed with the Maharaja. This is not only reflected in the magic level, but its body is equally powerful. Not to mention The top is also covered with thick cockroaches. It is not an easy task to kill it. Not to mention the mother of the soul, how do you control the core instrument? So the result will not change."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are hundreds of thousands of your people in this city. Do you want to bury them together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I really don't know, the witches of the federation era will actually sympathize with the devil." Nasopelle laughed and said, "Moreover, they are just traitors who have invested in Heckzod. They are not ruthless. It’s a waste of living with the gods created by God, but just spend more In the meantime, I can always make more. If you want me to change my mind, it is better to think of more persuasive reasons, and the time left for those bugs is running out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster...how did you see that she was from the federation era? Celine’s heart was amazed, but now there is no time to think about the details of this fine detail. “The stone of the gods is fine! If the floating land crashes here, Hermes and the Grey Fort West will also be affected. Are you sure that Wang will not punish you for such behavior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord of Heaven is really thorough..." Nasopelle does not look like it I thought it was, "But the priority of eliminating human beings is undoubtedly higher. Wang will certainly understand my difficulties. After all, there is a traitor in the Maharaja, and I can't do it without paying a price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "A little price? Is the Shenshi vein not the bed that the tower of the red fog must rely on! Without enough red fog, you can't stand on the fertile plains. Why should you stop the Tianhai world that follows? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This reason can be enriched than before." The mask has not been rejected. "But you have neglected two points. First, the symbiotic body has a long-term demand for 蜉蝣." It is lower than the original body and the ascending body. Even if resources are scarce, they will not be embraced. The second point is I have enough faith in mankind ah ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" Faith is ...... What do you mean, "he asked Celine teeth?. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did underestimate the talent of Ursuk. Humans are slow in magic, but they have shown amazing achievements in the other direction. I I am completely confident that if you inherit your inheritance and then combine it with my technology, it is not difficult to deal with the Tianhai world. In other words, even without these two stone veins, I can win the battle of God." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like a hunter who plays tricks on prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message could not be passed on, she could only stop the disaster on her own! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, time is gone." Nasopelle looked into the distance - the magic of the god who made the gods finally disappeared completely, slowly falling Gradually turning into a real fall, under the upheaval, the soldiers have been unable to maintain their standing and can only lie on the ground as much as possible. "I heard that when an object falls, the person standing on it will fly with it. I don't know if I can see this scene?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I get the core to restart? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin forced herself to concentrate on the spirit, the mask is not in the god of God, it is connected through the "net". Then expel the other party, it may be able to restore the magic core to normal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to get the sensation into the four cores, but in an instant she was countered! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an extremely complex cyclone picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is as good as the cyclone in the "Tianxuan" mode, and the four interact with each other to form a more dense magical cyclone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't say that at the same time parsing four, even if you deal with one alone, it takes a lot of time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is art... isn't it?" Nasopelle zoomed in on the cyclone, and suddenly there was a big "star" on the head of the two men. Rotating the structure, the magic is intertwined in it, and it shines. "I spent nearly a hundred years in order to calculate it. Four and two-thirds of my heads have been dealing with related issues. Other monarchs think that I am a monster... It’s ridiculous, if you don’t transform your body, you can absorb a lot of minds. How can you achieve this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the vortex like a galaxy, Celine felt a trace of despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time she also realized that the mask was using her opportunity to focus on the core to erode her body. It’s just that Celine didn’t have any thoughts to resist at the moment. If she couldn’t change it, the federation...and even the hopes of all mankind would be destroyed. So what is the difference between who she is occupied? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly think of a way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a picture of Roland in her mind. Creating a glimmer of life from the impossible, it was this man who revived the hopes of the Tacila remnants... But soon, she vetoed the idea, the "net" and the conscious world of the mask were completely different things. I can't get help from my Majesty here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can I resolve the stars? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the past, what did she do when she turned the core instrument into a sacred mode? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An electric light suddenly flashed through Celine’s mind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slammed her head down to the flashing "net" - a technique created using underground civilizations, and those that were distributed outside the net Point, it should be the magic core that has not been connected to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of this, no winter city exists! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since she can connect to the control center of the god of God through the core instrument, then other cores can certainly do this. Of course, distance is the biggest problem, but conversely, she may be able to use this hub to actively connect with other cores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then let Pasha and Elsie come to help her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they don’t have any effect on the situation...the only one she can send to is the only one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is one of the three seats that helped her deal with a lot of core computing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether Eleanor, who has long lost her mind and integrated into the central carrier, can respond to her call, Celine has no time to take care of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
