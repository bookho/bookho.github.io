			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is your master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland always feels that this guy’s emotions are better than the devil The number of people is much richer. If you ask a few more questions, you may be able to find out more information. At the same time, he gestured to the back, indicating that the injured Falun and Yan En left the place as soon as possible. Once he was passive and needed to escape, he ran faster than the witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a child of all things, you can't understand it," it spreads the red wings of the red light, reaching out to the ground, "small clever It doesn't make sense here, you want them to run now? It's late!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scarlet blood flows out of it and spreads quickly throughout the room. In the blink of an eye, the floor, walls and roof of the hall turned into a blood red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit that lost the hiding place was directly bounced off the wall and fell to the side of Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, what is this?" There was a low voice from Farn, and Roland turned his head and saw a red and black void. Roots with small claws of tentacles, the witch's hands and feet are firmly stuck in place ... and the appearance of the tentacles, he seems to have seen where. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the situation has suddenly turned sharply, he has no time to think so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm current is running wildly in the body, and Roland accumulates the power of the whole body and rushes toward the strange enemy in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? You are not affected?" The magic monster groaned and opened his hand to him. "So what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A powerful and unparalleled force spewed out of its palm and flew Roland out. The power was as big as a hammer and finally hit the wall and stopped. With a muffled sound, he felt that the back was hot, and the internal organs seemed to shift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," he couldn't help but cough twice, and then tasted the sweet smell that came out of his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"陛下!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice made an anxious cry, at the moment she is in addition to Roland The only one who can move, the claws behind the blade fluttering up and down, and the tentacles that protrude from the ground are cut off. Only the tentacle is endless, she will not be able to come close to him for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment has reached the most crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland’s mind was unexpectedly awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no fear in his heart, just like fear that this feeling has been removed by the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the warm current is getting faster and faster, and with the powerful heartbeat, he feels that incredible changes are taking place in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of this world is moving closer to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the vain streamer that covers the wall has become sluggish, and the scarlet blood line around him automatically bypasses his body, and those who are him Touching the place, a blue color appeared in the dark red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process is completely out of his control, and he does not know what happened. A voice keeps ringing in his ear, and the screams of chaos gradually change. Become a tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill it, kill it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster also found something wrong, There was a wave of ripples in its dry voice. "What is going on... What did you do to the magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not answer, he felt The warm current has already swelled to the limit, and the body almost subconsciously made a knee-shouldering movement. The next moment, he shot directly toward the enemy like a cannonball! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "killing and killing it, it's it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead "The monster is re-applied, and he is again pushed to him -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
