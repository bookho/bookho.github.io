			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." The ancient witches looked at each other for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Pasha answered, "Do not rule out this possibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I first Ask a question, how did you find the stone of the gods in the past?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The method of a thousand years ago is no longer acceptable, but I think it should be luck in all likelihood." Celine replied, "Entering the Federation era After that, the Quest Society was established, and it was our main job to find the Shenshi vein."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but think of the logo Tachaira The triangular positioning map of the fascinating forest test tower and the Beiposhan mining area is through which lightning finds the Aegis in the ice--the ancient history buried is also connected with the world at that moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the stone source has a strong shielding effect, we are using this feature to carry out the search. It was placed six or seven hundred years ago, like Sylvie Witches such as Nightingale, Lightning, and Isabella can be explorers. In peacetime, there are as many as 100 witches searched, and six veins have been discovered, three of which are suitable for large cities.” Celine continues. "Afterwards, we came into contact with the magical techniques of underground civilization and began to try to use the magic core to search - as long as the appropriate core capabilities are modulated, the sensing range can reach about 100 kilometers. The southern end of the hidden forest and Hermes The two parts of the plateau are the result. Unfortunately, the red moon has already come, and the devil has destroyed everything we have accumulated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, Exploring the mountainous area of ​​the spine is really of little significance to the union.” Roland slowly said. "Ordinary people can't enter, and it's hard to take care of the witch alone. But it's really inconvenient for the devil to stand up in this place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is not wrong," Isis nodded. "At least the whole army is unlikely to be dispatched. But it is necessary to satisfy the purpose of replacing Taqila to a certain extent, and to achieve the goal of destroying human beings. The area is right. In addition, how many troops the devil can station in the mountains depends on how long they have been prepared. If the "West Line Plan" in the mouth of the Usluck begins with multi-handed preparation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was at least half a year ago. "Axe axe," "Your Majesty!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Roland looked at everyone - no matter whether the speculation of the North Pearl was correct, it is necessary to confirm the information. After all, this matter It involves three other kingdoms, and the strategic direction of the next hundred years. Once the enemy is really guessing, it is intended to cut into the human territory from the mainland spine, and no winter city will invest a lot of resources in the construction of the defense line in the fertile plains, which will undoubtedly It is a disaster that never ends. "Listen to my orders now! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty! "Whether it is a witch or a no-high-level high-level audience.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wendy, notifying the lightning and wheat stalks on the front line, let them return to the winter city as soon as possible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand, I will go. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Axe, the immigration action should be as fast as possible, and it is fine to do it thoroughly." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "At the end I need Tacila to provide a magic core," he said to Pasha. "Considering that airborne investigations may miss information, you want to completely eliminate the hidden dangers." I still have to rely on your assistance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please, despite your dispatch, kneel down. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone went their own way, Catherine stopped Roland.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have something to show you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the other party to the underground laboratory, he was surprised to see that the table in the lead room was filled with four khaki stones, it looked It is almost the same as the ritual cube.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have assembled four Rubik's Cubes? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't wait to get up and pick up a stone to play. Compared to the samples found in the cursed temple, the imitation of the Rubik's cube looks sharp and angular. The lines are clearly identifiable, and the whole body reveals a new atmosphere.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a difference," Roland said in his heart for a second of silence. "After all, boiling water requires persistence, not lethality. You can then study in this direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, do you still need these prototypes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course! This is new energy Twilight!" He praised without hesitation, "The significance of imitation success is unparalleled. With this result, your merits will be enough to be remembered by future generations!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The next step is to design a device that converts the heat released by the Rubik's Cube into kinetic energy. If this step is successful, then the industry without winter city will usher in a new wave of change! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of Roland’s regret that he looks to the other sarcoma-like body, “You should have boarded the high platform of the central square to accept the cheers and congratulations of the people, and no winter. On the list of outstanding contributions, you should also have your name..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing to be sorry, my Majesty, the day I decided to become the original carrier, I will do it. It’s so awake.” Serin smiled. “This is just the job I should do, not to mention that you have fulfilled my wish in the dream world.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s orders quickly turned into the will of the kingdom, radiating from no winter to all parts of the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the castle, there are more than ten birds flying up every day, carrying a secret letter to the northeast - every seaport, every fleet, They will all contribute their strength to this big migration. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army went to Bishui Port, Haifeng County and other port towns in batches, and after they changed to sea-going vessels, they headed north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although even the specific plan has not been worked out at this moment, some grassroots officers do not even know what they are going to do, but after only one instruction, they take After the fake soldiers reorganized the team, they embarked on a journey to a foreign country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn, Glow City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovrid Quin received a secret letter from Hill Fox and immediately recruited his son. "You go to the beachfront immediately." In Long Fort, let the local lords give priority to all the passing Grey Fort vessels and provide at least one terminal for their exclusive use. The cost is paid by the royal family!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Father, are you sure?" Horne frowned. "This is a lot of money! And setting up a dedicated dock will affect other merchant ships loading and unloading..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Enough!" Horford interrupted his son. "You can just do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter bite his lip and finally bow his head "Yes, father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked to the door, he asked unwillingly, "At least you have to tell me what the Grey Fortress wants to do?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is always silence behind me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the door closed, Hofford spit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got up and walked to the window, looking towards the neighboring country. "The order in this world... has changed a lot."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the underground cave area on the outskirts of Huiguang City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barryh Lothar is in a wheelchair, staring at the more than two hundred silent people standing upright, and the administrator of the twenty wearer masks . This is the strength he has accumulated over the past decades, and his foothold in the "black money" chamber of commerce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the past few years, we have made a lot of comments on the forces of the wolf heart and the winter. It is time to recycle the benefits." After a long time of gaze Barrych whispered a hoarse voice. "According to reliable information, the Grey Fortress will soon enter the territory of these two kingdoms. No matter what they are going to do, your task is to help as much as possible - money, food. And the news, but what they need, "black money" must do everything they can to satisfy, understand? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
