			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire in the fireplace was burning, dispelling the chill from the gap between the door and window. At the top of the fireplace is a deer head with a large horn. Under the illumination of the fire, the projection of the horn on the back wall is like a huge claw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite is a dark red long wooden table filled with parchment rolls and books, mostly administrative orders waiting to sign names. In peacetime, Roland is here to handle his official duties. After transforming the three-story house into an office, he gradually fell in love with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the floor-to-ceiling windows behind him, he can see the town stretching in front of the horizon, and at the end is the endless mountains. It is a desperate mountain range that almost traverses the mainland, separating the gray castle kingdom and the wild land on both sides. The North Slope Mountain is just a branch of the Desperate Mountain Range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot, you can see the garden surrounded by wooden fences. The wooden shed for Anna’s training has been dismantled, and the brick pool has become a long table for convenient tableware for afternoon tea. If the weather is good, he will go to the sun below, or lie on a specially-designed rocking chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the castle is not big, it is a medium-sized villa with a separate garden. In the last life, I want to sit in a real stone castle, it is almost a fantasy, just visit the next have to pay for tickets. But now, he not only owns this castle, but also holds a town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, the recent recruitment of craftsmen and handymen is quite expensive, and the money is drawn from your pocket, so I am afraid that I will not be able to survive next year. Spring is over.” Barov held a stack of parchment and reported his recent financial situation to Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original income of Bianbu Town is very simple, one line is the trade of ore and gemstones. This line was monopolized by the Changge Fortress, replacing the output of the northern slope mine with wheat or bread. There was no tax in the middle, and the fortress was sent to preside over resource exchange. In the words of popular points, the North Slope Mine is a joint-stock project of the Changge Fortress. The aristocrats stationed in Bianbu Town can be regarded as the supervisors sent by the shareholders. Most of their seals are east of the fortress. They are only temporarily staying here, and the people coming here are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the history of Bianbu Town is less than 30 years old. It is a newborn baby compared to the long-song fortress that has been nearly two hundred years old. Originally, the Duke of Ryan was only planning to establish an outpost here to make an early warning of the invasion of evil beasts. However, it was not expected that the pioneers had discovered a wealth of mineral resources in the northern slopes, so they simply set up a town here and named it Bianbu Town. In a sense, it is the northern slope of the mine that created the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the sneak peek, the Duke did not adopt the advice of the aristocrats to send their own personnel, but to hire local residents and nearby refugees and even criminals. As a miner, the ore produced is distributed according to the proportion of resources invested by each family. The fortress here only needs to provide the employee with food and a small amount of commission for the whole year. These rewards are fixed amounts and will not change due to the output of the mining area. Most of the more than two thousand residents in Bianbu Town serve the mining area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other line is the other industries in the town - such as blacksmith shops, pubs, textiles, etc. The meager taxation of Bianbu Town mainly comes from here, and it is difficult to stay in the whole year. The incumbent lord did not take this barren land seriously. After Roland was sent to the land by the king of the Grey Fort, he simply stayed in the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Roland wants to hire someone to repair the city wall and only save money from his pocket. If it is the former four princes, then it must say that nothing will be willing, but for Roland, as long as you can stand firm in Bianbu Town, it is worthwhile to spend all the property. Anyway, the future ore trade will no longer be settled by grain. If it is settled by currency, this investment is simply drizzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that Changge Fortress is willing to give up the monopoly and conduct normal trade with Bianbu Town - this is quite a bit like a tiger, but Barov The inventory data provided indicates that it is limited to the inefficient manpower mining and inconvenient transportation. In fact, the ore value produced by the mining area is not more than a thousand gold dragons per year, but it is only a fraction of the total revenue of the fortress. The only ones whose interests have been damaged are the aristocrats who have invested in partnerships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the long-term development of Bianbu Town, this line must be withdrawn. Roland knew clearly that even if the investment of the gang was fully recovered as early as a decade ago, they would not let go. Mosquitoes are small and meat, not to mention the good thing that can be used to collect money. He is willing to give previous investors certain discounts and compensation, such as half-price purchases. But dragging a ship of ore back to exchange only half-ship food is not allowed to happen again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
