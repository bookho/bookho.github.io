			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The progress in the extreme south is going well, the iron whip clan has been destroyed, echo Thank you for your appreciation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Holy Duel needs preparation time. I expect the Iron Sand Clan to go to the Burning Place in a week."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With this space, I hired some people to mark the location of the underground river, I believe that a river of black water relatively close to the coast will soon be found." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, what are you going to do with the goddess in the clan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call to you. Iron Axe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, this is the message from the extreme south."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen The sign flashed with a slight red light, and Count Spur’s voice paused after the report, apparently waiting for Roland’s reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the night smashed another piece of the stamp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she is sitting at the table, I don’t know if it’s deliberate, the position that the stamp is handed over is placed on the slender thigh—but not In the summer, she still wears black trousers and reveals her perfect figure. If Roland wants to speak to the seal, he will have to be close to her leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that this is really a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know whether it’s the brightest look, or pretends to be careless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, do a good job... I mean an iron axe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Are you alright?" the count replied. "I listened a little hoarse to you, please keep warm in winter, and your body is no better than a witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Very good.” Roland cleared his throat. “Tell the iron axe. If there is no big deviation, let him continue to implement it as planned. As for the goddess, you can fight for it, but if the other party does not want to leave the extreme south, don’t force it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I will notify you if there are other requests. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, then let me retire, squat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The red light is extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland returned to his head and gave a soft breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the feeling of losing something? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale chuckles and closes the seal, a flashback back to the lounge chair, continue to chew the fish and look at the "Witch Story" comic strip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pouts and focuses on the right things. The Desert Operation put all the auditory marks into use, using the Spiegel Passi Earl of the Dragon Ridge to make a transit, to achieve instant contact between the Winter City and the advance troops - although the call is still somewhat inconvenient, but compared to the original The letter of transmission for ten days and a half, and the flight courier calculated on a daily basis, this connection has been called fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally has a feeling of not seeing the whole world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, listening to the seal requires the witch to inject magic to take effect, and to achieve conversation between the two sides, at least two sets of seals and two witches must be done. It is destined to replace the communication tools that ordinary people can use, such as telephones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first telephone line in Westland has now entered the laying stage, which will go directly from the castle office to the Changge District City Hall, and the second and third sections are also In the planning, it is expected that the two city halls will be connected, and then only one phone call will be required to pass the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that it takes time and effort to set up the pole, it is also vulnerable to snow and ice. Roland decided to arrange the cable along the mountain, sinking the lotus into the ground, which is convenient and convenient. Safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the migration of the Tsemula ancient witch is also the focus of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 and Lightning acted as an early warning, and the scope of investigation was extended to an area 10 kilometers north of the mountains, in order to detect the large scale of the evil beast in advance. attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the relics of the gods are likely to determine the survival of the ethnic group, and it is not an exaggeration to deal with them carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has had several conversations with Pasha in this half-month. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their plan is very simple, let the worm carrier open a mountain passage directly to the west, and then choose a stable rock formation, and open the palace with fewer ramps. Next, the ancient witches will continue to carry the carrier, the literature and the body of the gods to the new settlement. Finally, it is the turn of the instrument and the relics of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most active move is a witch named Fran, or... devour worms. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened the bloody mouth, squirming the round body and squeezing in front of the illusion instrument, excitedly thanking Roland, he was really shocked . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, after Pasha explained, the witch who devoted herself to the carrier could no longer be deposited in the body of the warrior, their perception and consciousness were consolidated with the new body. Together, the advantage is that there is no need for lengthy practice to use the carrier. The downside is that once the body is damaged, they do not have a spare carrier to replace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to come, if you don’t use this type of jointing, I’m afraid that the witch will not be able to get the carrier active for a lifetime – how can a person who is used to the limbs and fingers Manipulating a limb with numerous tentacles or worm-like telescopic advances? On the contrary, once adapted to this strange carrier, it is estimated that there is no way to return to the previous lifestyle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because devour worms need to consume a lot of food to support, so when not in use, the ancient witch had to transfer Fran into the soul container, so that she fell into sleep. This is obviously not a good experience. It can be said that she sacrificed her future for the continuation of the Taqila ethnic group, and the price paid by Pasha, Els, etc., which was transformed into the original carrier, was even heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least the latter can watch the world at all times and feel the changes and changes in the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, her gratitude to Roland can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is that he once boasted of Haikou, saying that there is no endless life in the winter city waiting for Fran - which means he has to spend a lot of money. Put the food in a state of keeping the other party energetic. Fortunately, worms are omnivorous carriers that are acceptable for both grain and meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to eat hot, spiced meat porridge, and whole cows that are grilled to the shiny skin!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Fran said these words, he basically said it while drooling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worm's appearance is ugly, but like the sarcoma, it can feel the external environment in a unique way, including taste, pain and temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can only accept her thanks with tears in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that no matter in which world, the construction industry is a huge swallowing behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, he also asked Pasha a sentence, the original and the central carrier is what fills the stomach, the answer is mud and high temperature - this is why they I like the reason for soaking in the magma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer gives Roland a little sigh of relief, probably more like a plant than a worm that devours worms. In this way, he does not have to bear the food expenses of these people who are close to infinity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he considered how to plan the mountain line, the military facilities built on the ground could be better connected to the existing ramps and even the ancient witch palace. At the time, there was a sudden explosion outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland turned to look at the floor-to-ceiling window, and saw a black smoke rising from the corner of the town, which was mixed with some faintly visible fire. The direction of the college near the inner wall of the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
