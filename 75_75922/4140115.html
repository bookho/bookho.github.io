			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The celebration lasted only a short while, and the position was busy again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rescuing the wounded, statistically fighting the results, advancing the railway, cleaning the battlefield... This is an urgent matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The command is very clear that the victory of this war is not the end of the torch operation, although it is impossible to start again with the remaining strength of the devil. The scale of the attack, winning Takira is almost a foregone conclusion, but did not go to the last step, no one dare to take it lightly. What's more, the demon is still alive. If this threat cannot be completely eliminated, it will not be a perfect goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity is indeed worth celebrating, but it has to wait until the flag of the Grey Fortress is placed at the highest point of the ruins and it is time to return to the Wintertown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some discussion, the united front has reached a consensus that the number of enemies in the ruins of the Holy City should be less than five hundred, except for the devil destroyed by this war. . From the perspective of strength, this means that the other party has no positive threat to the capabilities of the First Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the previous steady advancement, it is now considered to prevent the demon from fleeing - Tower 10 can be slowed down to prevent the opponent from losing prematurely War. At the same time, the ambush should also be launched as soon as possible. Even without the investigation of Hilli, the position of the First Army is now unlikely to be attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid night long dreams, after a day of rest, the first army launched a shelling again against the devil, but this time, they became the offensive side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the roaring shells, the only thing the other party can do is to step back and withdraw, and the trenches will be given out a little, and all return to the ruins of Taqila. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only sorcerers who can threaten the line of defense during the period. However, as the target of being targeted, it is difficult to get close to the position, not to mention the prevention. An army advanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With repeated failures, it has become less and less frequent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth day after the war, the railroad track was finally laid out in a shooting circle of ten kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After setting up the artillery position, more than 100 people, such as Ai Gesha and Felice, were invited by the iron axe to the front of the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the number of artillery pieces is far from enough, the artillery battalion commander Vanner also specially prepared ten hemp ropes and tied them with fire cables. In this way, they can "snap" the first shot of the city towards Taqila. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awakened person born in Taqila, the avenger of the purification of Tacula...and the builder of the new holy city in the future, each god is conscious of the witch This will be a moment of great historical significance. Whether or not they can survive the battle of God's will, today's scene will be remembered by history books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to apologize to you." Felice took the rope and whispered to Aisha. "I was laughing at the back four hundred years ago." If you use the mortal approach and say that the important work of handing over to them will only make the result a mess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There were many people who said this at the time. "The ice witch smiled. "So now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now..." Felice curled up her mouth, "the feeling of fighting with the mortal Not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Preparation--" At this moment, Fanna raised the command flag, "Open fire!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people pulled back the fire, and the rumble suddenly echoed over the position - more than a dozen cannonballs vacated and swept across the plains, rushing into the remains of the Holy City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violent shock wave spreads with a sound explosion, sweeping the remains of the ancient city that was left four hundred years ago, and is torn together by the waves and stones. Cracked, and the devil hiding in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beginning." Hillvi whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Andrea responded with a careless response, even if I couldn’t see the situation of Taqila, I could listen to the dull explosion. Out one or two - the tremor and the roar of the firing are completely different, even if they are separated by seven or eight kilometers, you can feel the power contained in them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the fifth day?" Maggie muttered. "Can the sorcerer come over today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows." Shrug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to go back to winter without hot pot and fried dumplings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕噜." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice has not yet fallen, and there is a sound of gastrointestinal motility in everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, teppanyaki is also good, if you can get another ice cream bread, it's better - hehe-"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes stuffed a piece of dry food into Maggie's mouth. "If you feel hungry, eat more of this. The taste is not good, but at least you can fill your stomach." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, don't forget, we are still performing the task," added Camilla Darry. "Which food can go back and think again, now please Concentrate and earnestly fulfill your duties."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is still so serious, obviously the throat has just moved. Andrea shook his head and turned his attention back to the direction of Takira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the first army, the special operations team left the camp according to the scheduled plan, bypassing the ruins of Takira, on the west side of the supply line. Lurking in the woods. Because they are unable to determine the intention and time of the retreat, they can only wait patiently to wait for the opportunity to arrive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the survival of the wild is not difficult for the witches, but considering that there are still beasts in the air, so don’t say that the fire is burning, even one There are no tents with sunshade and rain. Every night, everyone is wrapped in thick cloth and sleeps on the tree. When they are hungry, they will lick two wheat cakes. Naturally, they will not feel comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, when I heard the words of Maggie, she suddenly had a strong desire for no winter. When she first moved from Sleeping Island to No Winter City, she thought that this was just a new stop. The so-called "Witch Home" was only a boast of the ruler. If Tilly decided to leave, she also Will not hesitate to follow along. But now, in the face of this problem, Andrea is not quite sure...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft bed, the delicious variety, the automatic rogue cold Hot water, winter can also barefoot heating - even if she was a member of the Quine nobility, and did not enjoy such a comfortable life. It is not a luxury that relies solely on the golden dragons, but it is full of exquisite and chic from beginning to end. When she thinks about saying goodbye to these, she finds that she has some difficulties in making choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Tilly and Roland get along well, so she doesn't have to worry about where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving the demon, you must ask Roland to do your best, Andrea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal result is that the target is defensive to Taqila, and it is smashed into pieces by artillery. Secondly, when he escapes, he does not notice the existence of the ambush group at all. The penalty is to hit the commandment; the last time is that the other party has long perceived that they have the ability to accurately block from a long distance, using the ground-fighting flight and constantly changing direction to avoid, so that they can only be intercepted by the seagull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she had no confidence in the first two situations. In the night battle five days ago, the demon had once approached Takira from the position. But it kept moving irregularly throughout the process, and there was never a chance for her to find her hand. Is this a coincidence, or is it deliberately wary of yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷喔喔喔噢噢"————————"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a strange strange scream passed into everyone's ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" asked the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A shell hit a giant skeleton!" Hilvey exclaimed. "It's a big hole in the back, God, that thing. ...in the bark!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it still able to feel the pain? Look at the appearance, I thought it was just an empty dead body." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
