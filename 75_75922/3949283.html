			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is probably the day I have seen you lie the most," Tyro said after the departure of the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whoever let the person be the high priest of the church," Roland said, "How can you tell the other person's lies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the scene around him was swallowed up by the stone of God, I can only see a darkness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Unfortunately, the high priest could not be treated like a nobleman, and Roland regretted. He put the two balls on the table. "You said, is this thing really amazing as they say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you slow down the pain, morphine can do it. As for the soldiers to become more powerful, it sounds like the effect of adrenal hormones. The problem is to extract these two substances into pills. The church has long been conquering the world with this level of technology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc...Roland suddenly thought of a possibility, would it be related to magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you see the flow of magic?" He looked at the nightingale. "Is there a magic on these two balls?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nights carefully observed the meeting, "I don't see the magic, but it's a bit like a stone of punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The stone of God's punishment?" Roland lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," she nodded. "You have also seen the world under the fog, only black and white, but the black and the stone of punishment. The darkness is different, the latter is more like a hollow, swallowing the world around it. I don't know how to describe that feeling..." The nightingale hesitated, "It's better to say that it is darker than the hole." Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it is nothing," she Nod, "The two meatballs also have vain traces, but they are extremely subtle, and ... are not circular hollows, but they are like a black filament with a throttling."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does these vain influences your ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night catches the ball, unfolds the fog, and quickly retreats, "It seems to have no effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems necessary to find a prisoner of death to try the two pills to try out the effect," Roland will use paper Carefully wrap the child, hides her breast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect the church to be so optimistic about you," the nightingale sat back to the prince, a little depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the high priest does not wear the stone of the gods, I bet that there are nine sentences in the ten sentences." Roland pouted, "The most important point is that What they do and what they ask for is simply not right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Look at what they want: more churches, more believers, a prince or king who is supported by themselves, and then take the propaganda of the real monarchy. A stable country is more conducive to their development of believers, Development forces. Otherwise, churches and monasteries will become targets of robbery for refugees and nobles." "Is it a safe life for the people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so," Roland shook his head. "Stability comes from unity or balance, even if the king eats, drinks, and plays every day, unites the country. The people are also better than the refugees in the war. So it is not surprising that they support the second prince. It is not surprising to support the three kings. It’s strange to run to support me—especially when Garcia wins a big victory.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time if the church fully supports Garcia, I’m afraid Wangdu and the east line will be swallowed by her in less than half a year. At that time, 70% of the land in the Grey Fort Kingdom will be attributed to the hands of the Queen of Water, and Roland thinks that the pressure he faces will also increase greatly. Instead of helping the strong, instead of choosing the one that seems to be the weakest at the moment, it seems that the decision to teach is in your own interest. If you accept their support, the situation of the two kings in the gray castle will become more chaotic. The direct consequence of the three countries in the same version is that the population will be sharply reduced, the wealth will be quickly lost, the war will spread to the whole country, and the unified date will drag on. Drag again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
