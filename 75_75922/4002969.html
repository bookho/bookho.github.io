			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Roland looked over, "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is like this, Your Majesty... You don’t know much about alchemy, so it’s very likely to be blinded.” Lightning quickly blocked Rayleigh, and he was quite proud of himself. He was slightly underrespected in front of Tiefko, not to mention that he was once considered The four princes who did not learn nothing. If you annoy the other person, I am afraid that everyone will suffer. "The technique of alchemy is ever-changing. Every formula represents a new achievement. However, not all the results are as dazzling as snow powder. It may not be directly converted into Jinlong is the foundation that led to the birth of another outstanding product."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case," Rayleigh said with dissatisfaction, "take the strong snow powder. It says that the ice nitrate is converted from manure, which is itself an alchemical reaction. But in addition to ice making, it can be mixed with other alchemical products to make snow powder. These applications require long-term exploration. And even the most experienced alchemy masters, dare not assert that a reaction is meaningless, and that their value cannot be measured solely by Golden Dragon." He frowned at Roland’s chief, "If Someone dares to assure you, then he must be a liar!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Roland asked with a slight head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief alchemist does not seem to be in a hurry. He first touched his beard and waited until no one opened his mouth to raise his chest. "Your Majesty, they will That said, because the understanding of alchemy is still in the fur stage. I can prove to you that their formulas have long been nothing new, and the usefulness of the results has all been conclusive."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the words came out, the alchemists took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrighting has been stunned for a while, and this person knows what he is talking about? Are you familiar with every alchemy formula? What are you kidding! There are more than a dozen new formulas discovered by the Wangdu Alchemy Association in the past two years. Just look at it for several days. Does the other party dare to say that there is nothing new? In his heart, he was amazed by the sneak peek. The man named Kemer Stoll was completely insane. Just citing a formula he couldn’t say was tantamount to cheating! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most ignorant chief Archer couldn’t help himself, he whispered, "How do you want to prove?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple," Kemo walked confidently into the presence of three people. "You put out the raw materials. How do I say the results of the alchemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Ruili was laughed at. "Good, what materials are in the association, you can always verify it. If you are wrong, don't think you can squat like you in Bianbu Town!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What if I am right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible!" Chil shook his head again and again. "The alchemy formula is indeed likely to be repeated, but it is impossible to exhaust it - you are too small to look at alchemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is strange The look, like feelings, is like pity. "I don't look down on alchemy, but it is wrong in itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrighting feels the forehead jumps, "What are you talking about?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me ask first, what is the alchemy in your eyes?" Kemo is unmoved, "chaos, complicated, ever-changing, difficult to ponder? No... you I don’t know anything about alchemy, or the essence of everything.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s a nonsense!” Rayleigh shouted. “Do you want to say this? Is the study of the sages simple, orderly, and still a gluttonous one? If it is so, how can it be possible to evolve a lot of colorful materials to make every stone in this world different?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Lightning fear is that the other person actually chuckled. "Oh, that's right... it's simple, orderly, and one-of-a-kind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for why this world is so colorful, it is no longer alchemy Can take care of the scope," Kaimo said calmly. "In other words, it is a higher realm. I just saw the threshold." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Otherwise, if he goes on, he will not be allowed to scream at Kemo, and he will also join in the recruitment of him as the chief Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is really a madman, alchemy is simple and orderly? Lightning thought bitterly in his heart, he must let the other party taste a profound lesson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long table in the center of the refining hall was cleaned up with several A small bottle and three white sheets of paper, the name of the material is written on the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some discussion, the three chiefs decided to choose a formula for each to let Camo Spoel prove his claim. In order to leave the impression of not deliberately blaming others, while avoiding the entanglement of Kaimo, the three also wrote the name of the raw materials. As the other party did not recognize it, it would not matter to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything is ready, Lightner looks to the chief alchemist who is under Roland and says, "Please start."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter walked to the first white sheet of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Soda and green simmered?" He glanced at the contents of the paper and looked a little surprised. "You also found the double stone acid method." The product is a variety of solids and acids, the latter can corrode the metal." At the same time, he also lifted the pen and wrote a long string of symbols on the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achille's face was very ugly, "Yes... sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The onlookers of the alchemists rushed to the ear, probably no one expected, the first chief selected formula was said to be the answer in less than a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet!" Lightning said. "There are two more questions!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He It just happened to be right," Rayleigh slammed. "The second formula is not so lucky. Right, what are the things he wrote on paper?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and raised a bad hunch in his heart, and the development of the fact quickly deviated from the expectations of the two. Kemer did not even stay at the table for too long, he said As a result, but also pointed out the trap set by Rayleigh, "green citrate and copper? If the acid content is too small, this reaction can not be carried out. If the concentration is high, heating can make the liquid turn blue. At the same time, there are bubbles coming out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem set by Lightening did not cause any trouble to him. "Extracting the Netherstone? No other conditions?" Do not grab the bottle and shake it, and look at the white solid soaked in the water. "This thing is quite rare. It is easy to ignite spontaneously when placed alone in the air. White smoke, and finally left a white solid, I am right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Lightning was completely shaken, this thing is The strange items that you exchanged with the Alchemist of the Wolfheart State have seen very few people, not to mention its characteristics! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can also ask questions," Kemer turned and looked at the alchemists on the side. "I will prove it to you, what I said is not False words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly boiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the mixture of meteorite and charcoal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the temperature is high enough, you can get Iron, which is essentially a special kind of iron ore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do the smelting sands get different colors of glass, don't you say that alchemy has not changed? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the impurities inside are different, crystal glass needs the purest grit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Kemo, I have a question!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lightning was surprised to find that the atmosphere in the hall was changing rapidly, and the alchemists changed from asking questions to asking for advice, and even the title also paid tribute. He realized that Kaimo is becoming the chief of recognition in everyone's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
