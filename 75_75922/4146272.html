			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loading dock is about 15 kilometers away from the warehouse building. In order to be unobtrusive, all the witches split their actions and each took a taxi to their destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland was the last to leave, he still drove the broken bread, carrying Felice, Falcon and others out of the community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since participating in the joint annihilation of the martial arts association, he has personally geared up his personal combat equipment, although he can’t be as comprehensive as the association, but buy some people. It is not impossible to use supplies under the cottage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the portable walkie-talkie he bought on a website not only comes with a Bluetooth headset, but also has an effective contact distance of five kilometers - although it was found in the actual measurement, In the case of surrounding buildings, or complicated electromagnetic environment (more base stations), this distance will suddenly reach two kilometers or less, but considering the other party’s price is less than two hundred, more purchases and discounts, Roland resolutely gives Every ancient witch is equipped with one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least this stuff is more convenient and more concealed than a mobile phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always thinks that the positive and negative factions in the movie are too deliberate because the mobile phone suddenly sounds at a critical time and the whole army is overwhelmed, if you It’s too stupid to meet this thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Falcon, who has tracking and positioning capabilities, has become an information processing center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, the Betty Group has arrived near the loading dock and has successfully merged with Ling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let them conceal first, wait for the big troops to come back and act." Roland said without saying back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. The Yan En group is almost five minutes away, but the money on her may not be enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...you ask who is still there, wait for her to help her pay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, she said The driver just heard their conversation and promised the fare for the fare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." Roland couldn’t help but rolled her eyes. Have you ever encountered such a good thing when he took a taxi? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falzen’s cell phone just hangs in less than five seconds and rang again. “Your, flash said that her car seems to be going to detour, destination and It’s not like loading docks.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland frowned, “her position is-”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Before he finished, he heard a muffled sound from the other party’s earpiece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a series of noises such as squatting - squatting - bumping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing left to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked his forehead. "That... let them take a car again. Be careful not to be photographed by the camera when you leave."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, sire." Farn screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, when everyone arrives in the dock area, it is almost an hour later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first-time team even had a smashing of the seeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the enemy seems to use the dock as his temporary stronghold, and he did not realize the arrival of the witches. If this is a pursuit, I am afraid they will have long been Escaped without a trace. Roland suddenly felt that he might buy a few more vans next time, lest the similar scenes happen again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cleared his throat and looked at the spirit. "How is the enemy now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Returning to the squat, the demon people are basically in the loading and unloading area, the number is at least 30. The iron boxes on the outer ring have their eye whistle, it is not difficult to avoid the other side by relying on the ability of the envy. The light on one side is very good. I can't rely too close. I can only look at it from a distance. Most of the enemies are gathered in that area, but there are too many places to escape. If it is fighting, it is difficult. Make sure you don't let them go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland indulged for a moment. "If that's the case, then bring them out and annihilate them. As long as you are far from the river bank, we can cut off the enemy's escape route and completely surround them."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The theory works well, but...how do you want to attract?" Felice asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smiled and pointed at himself. "I heard that they are attacking the martial arts everywhere. Now that I see a single order, there is no reason to let it go." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the witches disappeared into the darkness of the night, Roland was hiding from The place went out, slowly entered the yard area, and regarded himself as a walker who accidentally passed by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yard was silent at this time, except for his footsteps and the occasional sound of insects, no other sounds could be heard. The dim light came from the pier, and it was so faint that it could only faintly see the outline of the boxes stacked around it. This undulating, criss-crossing "wall plaque" seems to constitute a maze of gloom, and it doesn't look like someone will come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cheap wholesale walkie-talkie played a role at this time, and Yan En reminded that the demon who was hiding on the dock had a movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously those wandering whispers noticed the fluctuations in the forces of nature on his body and informed the gang about the situation. The only thing that surprised him was that The enemy did not immediately start, but let him sway back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the searchlight of the yard was suddenly opened, the entire venue became as white as it was! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dazzling white light, Roland faintly saw ten personal shadows slowly showing his body shape, and when his eyes adapted to this sudden glare, he found himself Has been surrounded by the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The headed man wears a mask with a strange pattern, which is distinct from the surrounding demon in both the momentum and the appearance. Roland noticed that the pattern on the mask looked like a door that was about to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the two men around him are not like the general demon, their eyes are not sluggish, and they are still wearing the robes of the martial arts association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good evening, poor people who lost," the leader was unexpectedly polite. "Although I don't know what the wind has blown you here, but You should understand that it is impossible to escape now. Instead of wasting your energy on meaningless things, it is better to listen to me quietly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked around for a week, and sure enough, he saw the figure of the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid, I didn't kill you. On the contrary, this may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me - I just came here. The world, you need your help." The man said, "Don't rush to refuse, please allow me to introduce myself: I am the messenger of the gods, Alpha, from what you call "erosion." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the original idea, Roland should pretend to be panicked at the moment, so that the enemy can relax, but I don’t know why, looking at the other person’s courtesy. Everything is in the grasp of the attitude, he suddenly wants to rush to give the other two broken face punches.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the monsters invading the Prism City? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Intrusion is not accurate, because it should belong to the gods here," Alpha is not slow, "now it is only when it is time to return." Listen, the lost, your so-called martial arts will certainly fail, and instead of being nothing, it is better to loyal to the gods. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't understand it now and it's normal. About the truth about this world, there is a lot of time to elaborate." Aside from those illusory promises, I can now show you the most immediate benefit - power. He stretched out a finger, and with a little red light on his fingertips, a strong magical wave flocked out. "I can inject it into your body, making you far stronger than it is now." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God did not deceive you," the two men around him agreed. "I just woke up soon, but now I feel that I can’t finish it." the power of! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
