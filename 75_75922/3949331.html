			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get here today, class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher goodbye." Little girls Qi channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irene closed the textbook and watched the children out of the classroom—the house originally belonging to a noble family, but was collected by the lord after the demon month. It has now been converted into a college. Upstairs and downstairs, the partition wall of the small room is opened, and several large rooms are connected. It can accommodate four to six batches of apprentices at the same time. According to the division method of the textbook, it is called "class". During the day, the class is mostly children, and at night it is an adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought that she wanted to be a teacher’s application for a long time before she could pass to the city hall. I didn’t expect the film to report it to the next day. I got the allowed message. Then go to the City Hall to register your identity, receive the materials, and get a placement form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subjects she is responsible for are basically children of the town. In order to let the group of gangsters take good lectures, she spent a lot of time. There is also a chapter devoted to how to maintain classroom discipline. The tricks inside her open her eyes, in addition to traditional verbal criticism and rattan corporal punishment. There are evaluations first, divide the group, set up the team leader and the squad leader, let them manage themselves and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who wrote this textbook must be an elder who has been studying for many years in order to consider such a comprehensive experience? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the college, Irene saw her knight waiting at the door, film. Silt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is no longer wearing shiny armor, holding a shield embroidered with a lion emblem and a long sword, but still handsome. A simple leather coat set off his straight figure, with a line of five facial features, even with empty hands, is the dawn of her dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After giving him a hug, Irene noticed that Fei’s look was a bit wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." He hesitated. "His Royal Highness invites us to go to the palace for refreshments in the afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Irene groaned, "We?" She immediately guessed what the other person was worried about, patted him on the back and shook his head. "The prince has never seen me, how could it be like the duke... ...say again, isn't there still you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the film nodded. "This time, I will protect you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Irene simply dressed up and chose a decent dress to go to the Lord's Castle with her husband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being introduced to the living room by the guards, it didn’t take long for a gray-haired man to appear at the door. There is no doubt that he is the lord of the Western Front, His Royal Highness Roland Wimbledon. He is also followed by a lady who is about 30 years old. His posture is calm and capable. From the full-fledged facial features, she can be seen that she must be a beautiful woman when she is young. The two quickly got up and bent down to salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome, Sirte," Roland sat down in the main seat. "These are all court dishes on the table, even if you enjoy it, you don't have to be restrained." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your invitation, it is my pleasure to come here for refreshments." Film replied according to noble manners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This lady is called the book, and is also the head of the Ministry of Education of the City Hall. I think you should have already seen it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," he nodded to the book to pay tribute. "I have not thanked you, Irene will not become a teacher so soon without your permission."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out that she helped herself, Irene thought, and cast a grateful smile on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just chatting for a while, film asked tentatively. "I don't know what my highness called us here, for what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Related to education," Roland paused and looked at Irene. "I heard that you used to work at the Fortress Theatre. Is it a theatre actor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
