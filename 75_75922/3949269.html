			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the misty morning fog, Tiefko Wimbledon can vaguely see the flag flying on the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised the lookout and tried to identify the family emblem on the flag. The sailboat and crown pattern on the green background is undoubtedly his sister, Garcia Wimbledon. This is also the flag of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the white flag, the tall tower on the white cloth and the poisonous snake wrapped around the tower, which is the emblem of the Bala family. Oh, he sneered at the bottom of his heart, and he turned to the blue water queen, but still hangs the banner of the high tower pattern, it is simply shameless. When I catch you as a traitor, I have to feed the flag to you, but the Earl of Bara. He thought to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is the red tower of the tall tower lion, the same shameless Xita family. Tiefko was expressionless, but he had already sentenced Elin Sita to death, just like Toman Barya. Of course, you also have to eat the flag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Naimen, lift the flag of the Grey Fort Kingdom!" Tiefco ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow, squat." The hurricane knight responded, and then the horse ran to the army behind him. "The king has a life, a flag!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new king turned back and saw a flagpole lifted up, the gray flag spread out with the wind, the black pattern looked solemn, the huge tower and the sides fell, The long guns that cross each other, this is the emblem of the king of the gray castle. Any traitor will be pleaded guilty under this banner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the news of the independence of Garcia, he immediately took countermeasures - mobilizing the people of Dongjing and Wangdu, attacking the Eagle City. Although his heart was like a huge wave at the time, it was still calm on the surface, which gave the minister who supported him a lot of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confessor and the troops spent nearly a month, spent a week in the east, and spent half a month rushing here, Finally arrived at the Eagle City when the sun set. Fortunately, the king is not affected by the demon moon. The road to the south will not be accessible because of the snow. On the contrary, the ground is very strong because of the low temperature. The speed of the carriage of the grain is faster than those of the free people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His team is very large, mainly with his own guards, the Knights of the Kings and the troops of the Duke of the East, Fran Chelit. There are as many as 6,000 people in the three batches, and the well-trained and well-equipped knights have as many as 1,000. According to reliable information, there are fewer than 3,000 troops in Garcia, and most of them are free people in the clear water port. It is still okay to rob the unarmed peasants and merchants. The frontal battle cannot be the opponent of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister Sir Gold has raised objections. He believes that after the end of the demon month, all localities will have to cultivate. At this time, the army will be adversely affected by the harvest. . Therefore, Tefko did not ask the vassals to dispatch the serfs to fight, but to convene the free people on the territory, who are responsible for the logistics. In this way, even if they fight in the south, they will not fall into the spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Tiffco. Wimbledon must not allow Garcia to stay in the South again. The Eagle City is not a strong city. Its predecessor was a market, just in the middle of the surrounding towns. Later, with the development of commerce and trade, it gradually evolved into a city, and the time was less than one hundred years. In addition, in order to promote its pro-business image, successive lords did not build insurmountable high walls. The civilian forces of 3,000 and the counts of the two counts are not a big force. The sooner one day, the counter-measures will be made. If she is given a breather, let her completely integrate the entire South, it is very difficult to beat her again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a night of rest, his men have already eaten enough and are ready to go. The sun gradually changed from orange-red to bright-eyed gold, the fog began to dissipate, and the brown-brown wall also showed its true body. In the eyes of the new king, it was not really a real wall, but at best it was a soil. Slope is gone. From the bottom of the slope to the top of the slope, there is a slope, without any siege ladder, you can climb up directly with your hands and feet. The top of the slope is inserted with a circle of fences and one person, which can block the displaced people and the robbers, but can not stop the armed soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the city are standing sparsely, obviously not as ready to defend the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, the cavalry responsible for the South Gate, said that the action of the brigade was observed." The Hurricane Knight ran back to the new king, Lemahui reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco handed the lookout mirror to the Duke of Fran, and said in a relaxed tone: "Looks like she wants to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
