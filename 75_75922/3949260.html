			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? Rolander glared at the writings. The masters of the ancient books had fought against the monsters in the wild. He moved his eyes down -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are more and more devils, and we are getting fewer and fewer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Stone of Divine Penalty is also unable to stop their offensive. With that unbeatable power, even if they don't rely on magic, they are also horrible and terrible enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The holy city of Taqila has fallen, we are running away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Turning over the mountains, crossing the river, you can get away from the gates of hell. How far can you escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But next time, where can we escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But this is not something I need to consider, I am dying, Nataya."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of the devil is eroding me, any medicine It doesn't work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wrote this, just because there is something I want to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Akaris’s Prisoner’s Penalty Test is nearing completion, try Very successful, the extraordinary warrior did not fall into the wind even if he faced the devil. But she forgot, in the end, even if the gods punished the victory, this victory does not belong to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, God's penalty will only bring us destruction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go stop her. Only you can do it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This text is not long. After sweeping from start to finish, Roland closed his eyes and tried to substitute himself into Hakhara’s perspective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming she doesn't know the devil's existence and replaces the devil with a witch, this description is easily imagined by her as a church army to retreat under the attack of the witch. . Then combined with the widely rumored rumor that the witch is the devil's minion, the magic comes from the door of hell, and Hakala is very likely to think that the church actually wants to hide the truth: the so-called hell gate is the entrance to the holy mountain. For centuries, the witches have successively traveled to the Holy Mountain and have gained eternal life there. So there are more and more witches, and fewer and fewer church soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this guess also has a lot of loopholes, for example, the note mentions that the other party has far more extraordinary power than the ordinary people, obviously not the characteristics of the witch. For example, the witch can still make the church army defeated under the influence of the stone of the gods. This seems too bizarre. So what exactly makes Hakala determined to go to the wild, he still does not know. Is her too urgent mood affecting the judgment, or is there a part of the book that has not been stolen, is it the real incentive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland prefers the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows at least now, the devil described in the last page of scribble notes, not a witch, but a truly heterogeneous race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not reduce his doubts, but makes the unknown problem more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did the church fight the devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland turned over the poor occultist knowledge of the Four Princes and found no relevant content. Since the end of the war of faith, the church has built the base camp in the north to withstand the evil beasts that have invaded the mainland from the big gap. Later, they simply built a majestic fortress city on the Hermes Plateau and called it the new holy city. The two cities, one high and one low, are used to fight evil spirits, not the devil. Besides, the name of Tacila has never been heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these things are true, the church has no reason to hide it. In the books that record the history of the church, every success in resisting the evil beast and the great victory in the battle with the witch will be described in detail above. It seems that I am afraid that others do not know their merits. But how to look at the devil is more worthy of a book than a beast and a witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question is God's penalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously this church member does not want to see the emergence of the gods, and entrust others to stop the relevant person in charge of the trial. It seems that it is a success? Roland only knew that the church had a trial army, and had never heard of a god-prisoner - certainly not the reason why the four princes were ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
