			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland swipes the quill pen and writes a paragraph of text on the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came here, I was drawing mechanical drawings on the computer all day. He thought that he had very few chances to write with the pen again. I didn’t expect to use it again. An ancient way of remembering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two documents placed next to him, which are the plans that he intends to implement next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is the large-scale production of sulfuric acid, the new equipment has been manufactured in the hands of Anna and Soroya, and the lead reaction vessel has been changed to be more robust and reliable. The iron shell, with an anti-corrosion coating, is three times larger than the previous test version. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that there is no way to collect or purify the production of exhaust gas (mainly from sulfur combustion and leakage of nitrogen oxides) at this stage, Roland set it away from Chishui The location of the river and the residential area - the southern end of the industrial park, and plans to isolate the building outside the reactor, and set up a chimney to increase the exhaust emission height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because increasing sulfuric acid production has greatly helped expand the scale of concentrated nitric acid production, putting equipment into production is currently the most important task. The content of the instrument is to order Kaimo Sputel to select a group of disciples to specialize in the mass production of sulfuric acid. Barov also needs to recruit some reliable local residents to assist the handymen. The number of the entire chemical plant is about 100. about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second document is the formation of a public health system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Roland is not familiar with this aspect. It is ignorant about modern medicine, but this does not prevent him from formulating a current requirement based on common sense. Simple plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the biggest role of this department is propaganda and popular science, such as water to be boiled, meat to be cooked, sick and coping, parasites The difference between microbes and so on... Thanks to their growing prestige, it is not difficult for the people to do something as required, but if they want to understand why they want to do this, they must have someone to specialize in education. . This kind of thing is useless once, then it is repeated seven or eight times, dozens of times, like the slogan hanging in the field, much more, everyone will slowly accept this view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is to encourage fertility--the City Hall has limited staff. He is not willing to set up a separate family planning department and temporarily put this into public health care. The population is always the most scarce resource in this era. It is natural that the people can live more naturally. Nana's ability is to make up for a series of thorny problems such as production risks. If she is, the postpartum survival rate can reach 100%. . In addition, in order to avoid the abandonment of the baby girl and the occurrence of such incidents, he has formulated detailed subsidy and punishment policies. For example, the baby girl’s subsidy is slightly higher than that of the male infant, the subsidy is distributed in stages, and the abandoned baby will face fines and imprisonment. Wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is responsible for the charge. In addition to fertility treatment, the hospital will charge a certain fee according to the amount of magic consumed by Nana, which is to reduce the burden on the girl and lay the foundation for the future hospital system. Roland, the head of the first department, has already thought about it, that is, Nana's father, Tiguin Pinen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third document is the one being written in the hand, and the most complicated and huge one of all the plans - the Bianyi Town Construction Project. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It involves the expansion of the town itself and the implementation of the long-song fortress. It is necessary to enact a series of popular laws to govern the people of the two places, the trial system. And the two loops of the public security system have to be added. If you want to write these contents in a dripping way, it is definitely not enough to know your own knowledge. Roland intends to list a draft first, and other details will be discussed with the city hall manager Barov. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After writing the beginning, he moved some soft wrists and walked to the floor-to-ceiling windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather today is very gloomy. I didn’t see the sun in the morning. In the afternoon, the sky was covered with dark clouds. It seems that heavy rain is brewing. The chilly autumn wind swept over the back garden of the castle and heard the rustling sound of the olive groves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a black spot appeared on the horizon and flew in the direction of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s lightning," the sound of the nightingale came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
