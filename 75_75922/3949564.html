			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa got up from the bed and made a big yawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the whitewashed window, it is still a constant snow scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl reluctantly moved out of the warm bed, put on a thick winter coat, and slowly walked out of the bedroom, only to see Ada Aunt cleaning the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning," she said vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, little princess, you got up." Ada smiled at her. "Do you want to have breakfast? It’s already hot."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Nanawa sat down at the table and scanned the room for a week without finding her father. "What about my father?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pein adults went out early in the morning," Ada’s voice came from the kitchen, "bearing his silver-white shotgun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, she pouted, it is estimated that she rushed to the wall to practice shooting - since the use of firearms against the evil beast, he became fascinated with this thundering weapon. Every day, holding the barrel and rubbing it, I don’t say it. When I have time, I ran to the wall. I even used my medical ability as a bargaining chip. I got a special gun from the seat of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s strange to say that the long-range shotgun is the standard equipment for hunters. Nanawa thinks that if the mother is still there, he should not go out like this. Run it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Breakfast is coming," Ada put two steaming dishes in front of Nana Va, "fried eggs and white bread, eat hot and fast." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakfast should be done before the father goes out, in order to Avoid cold, and also specialize in hot water insulation, only the heart of the Ada Aunt will do so. If you let your father take care of yourself, you will definitely get iced eggs that are frozen and hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa can't help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she can marry her father, how good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the little girl knows that this hope is unlikely to be realized, Ada is a servant at home, and her father is now a nobleman in Bentham Town - according to his own knowledge The knowledge, aristocracy and ordinary people are difficult to combine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two or three times to solve the bread and eggs, Nanawa wiped her mouth and said: "I went to the hospital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay," Ada put down her broom and sent her to the door, kneeling down and tying her scarf. "Be careful on the road, Miss Pine."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa went out to the door with Xiaoxue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her daily routine: going to the hospital from home in the morning, helping the injured if there is a wounded person, practicing with animals if not ability. At noon, I went back to the castle and served under the roman of Roland. I continued to stay in the hospital in the afternoon and returned to the house in the evening—she was the only witch who did not live in the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the time spent waiting in the hospital is a bit boring, but in order to allow those injured to get treatment in the first time, she has persisted. The other who supported her was the smile and enthusiasm of the townspeople. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nanahua, good morning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Angel, go to the hospital again Have you?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The weather is not very good today, pay attention to the body. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Having eaten breakfast, Miss Pine, I just cooked a hot porridge, come and drink a bowl!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the road, greetings like this one after another, compared to the scene a year ago, there are two situations - sisters say that she It is now the most popular witch in Bianbu Town, and even Anna can't compare it. Nanawa doesn't care who is more popular. She just likes the current atmosphere. Every town who has been treated by her will be affectionate. She said hello, which filled her with a sense of accomplishment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came to the hospital, the first army soldier at the door respectfully saluted her. "Hello Miss Nana, hello."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, have Was the injured person sent over?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Not at the moment,” said the soldier. “It’s your friend’s coming.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends? She gave a slight glimpse. Did Anna come to see her? Thinking of this, Nana Wasa ran up the second floor and opened the door, but saw the mystery moon, the hummingbird and Lily squatting at the table, and when she saw her, the three immediately got up and surrounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha, are you surprised? We made a special trip to find You play!" Mystery moon raised his hand and shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the mystery month says that the castle is still idle, it is better to go out," the hummingbird added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very busy, but I am not at all idle, there are so many bug samples to observe," Lily complained at the end Dao, "And Miss Nanava should be very busy. Do you think she is like you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? I saw you yesterday. The microscope kept going to sleep, and it was obviously impatient." Mystery shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where, where is there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not Anna, Nanawa’s heart is slightly lost But it will recover soon. Anna’s sister is now the busiest person around her Highness. Naturally, it’s impossible to accompany herself as often as before. This is no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I am very busy," she laughed. "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cough... Since you have said this, then I will stay with you to be good," Lily turned her head. "The bugs will not be a problem until tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are we going to play?" the hummingbird asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you still ask," Mystery Month pulled out a deck of cards from his arms, "Of course this!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, fighting landlords is very interesting, but only three people can play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not a landlord," she Shaking my head mysteriously, "It's a new way of playing. It can be played by four people. It's faster than anyone's card. I learned it from Andrea yesterday!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sleeping Island playing cards trio?" Lily helped the forehead, "Who is not good, you go to learn them... If you take these strengths to learn the new knowledge of Your Highness, you will not There is no progress now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are also from the roman of Roland," the mystery protested. "Why don't you study His Royal Highness?" New knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Except for you, there is no other person in the Witch Alliance who thinks so," Lily glanced at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also want to learn..." The hummingbird whispered aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa looked at it all and couldn’t help but laugh out. She seemed to be back to the teacher’s college, and lived an unfettered day. Add me one... Since it is three-on-one, then decide, let's get a deal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of three people, the original boring morning passed in the blink of an eye. After returning to the castle for lunch, Nana Wa returned to the hospital alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walked into the hall, she saw an unexpected person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl. Vabert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Carl!" Nana Wah surprised. "How come you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
