			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be so sad, Master Mayn," Jielu said with his hands behind his back and walked slowly around the square. "The church was originally created by the Federation. Your Majesty's doing this is just giving the witch a chance to return to the original owner. If you win, you can also get my memories and experiences - that is the wealth accumulated in two hundred years."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that the image of Jielu’s initiation of the reflection church itself is very strange. She is again loved by the pope, but it is only a pure person, and it is impossible to reach the secret of the deepest part of the church. Unfortunately, I ignored this at the time. After a moment of silence, Mayn said: "If you win, where are you going to take the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leading to victory," she looked up "Or annihilation... It can't be a fjord island anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that the secret order you posted is really unknown?" Jielu’s tone revealed a sarcasm. "Before the war, some parts were transferred to the Yongdong Harbour for repairing the vessel." And the supply of sailors. In addition to picking a large number of scapegoats to send the gallows, this is a big deal, it is almost impossible to get through the church's eyeliner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn Oberlin actually delivered the intelligence agencies in the secret area to her. "What can you explain! As a pope, of course, I have to think farther. If it is a last resort, let the church continue to survive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Is this you afraid that you don't believe it yourself?" Luo laughed and said, "I just took the scepter in front of many believers and began to think about my own path. If the god of war has not yet arrived, I have lost the belief of winning. With mortals like you, I also want to get God. Smile?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a shit god smiles!" Mayn couldn't help but growl. "If it really cares about us, how can it make humans lose again?" "He lost?" He took a deep breath and lowered his voice. "And, fighting the devil eventually depends on God's penalty, time is imminent, and you can change something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not only God's penalty," Jielu whispered, "Human fate should not be entrusted to only a small group of people."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you rely on your witches?" Mayn sneered twice. "Don't forget how your compatriots were defeated more than 400 years ago!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"The witch is just a small group of humans," she stopped, looking directly at the pope, the light in her eyes. He was chilling. "This is a decisive battle that determines the fate of human beings. It is natural for everyone to participate in it. No matter how old or young, men and women, they will become glorious fighters. They will rush to the battlefield until they defeat the devil, or ...all died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s ridiculous, let the civilians who are scared to see the evil beasts fight the devil, this is your plan. ? I don’t know what it is - "Mean suddenly stunned, and the other person’s look is not like a joke, but a statement of his own in a serious way. It can only make civilians have combat capabilities, only...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to feed everyone to eat mad pills? "He didn't dare to open his mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A madman can't compare with the gods, ten?" "Jie Luo squinted." Now is the time when the evil beasts are flooding. Not only is the supply of raw materials stable, but the pivotal area may be able to develop several new formulas. After five years, the church is enough to save three or four million pills. What does this mean? "She paused." It means that in addition to the gods, the Holy City can send out a few mad forces of as many as one million people to participate in the war against the devil. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...insane!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Insane? It’s too young to watch the battle of the end! "Pure people suddenly shouted, "The federation is good, the church is worth mentioning. All that comes to mind is to use a small force to resist the enemy's best efforts. Failure is just a matter of reason." In the face of this war, no one can stay out of the way, and mortals cannot hide behind God's fines or witches forever—as I said before, this is a battle of destiny, everyone should go all out, so that Eligible to compete with the devil in the wild! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure person who is kept by the church can never say such a thing. This is... the will of the conqueror, and the face of Mein is like a white paper, "You It's a... a real hybrid! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accepting knowledge is the process of self-change, and the blending of ideas will bring progress," Jielu took a deep breath. "Perhaps, we should end the conversation and decide who is the leader of the church."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't think you won," the Pope gritted. "This is the world I built!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the voice landed, there was a sudden burst of red mist under his feet, spreading around. Jieluo glimpsed slightly, then licked his throat and made a scream. The skin on his face was like a curled orange peel. The pieces were wrinkled and fell off. The blood that oozing out was flowing, and soon it was not adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the fog of the devil stored in the shackle, only to the witch who has magic," Mayn stood in the red mist and hate "I will fill the entire square if you fill it up. You can only struggle in the fog and die again and again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is it?" The scene suddenly blew a gust of wind, and the red mist around the pure person was swept away. The newly reborn Jieluu endured the pain and said, "I am not the new pope, but I have hidden some new things. If you go to the library of the Pontifical Temple in the first place, I am afraid this battle will be even more difficult - of course, this is also the fun of the soul war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This is...the wind magic stone? Mayn noticed that she had a ring with green spar on her finger. The magic stone has a limited range of functions. Just pull the distance and use the sacred stone to destroy the barrier. However, in order to prevent accidents, I still have to make some preparations first. His thoughts in his mind have turned sharply, and two mad pills have been constructed, and they have swallowed them in one breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, wise choice," Jieluo snorted. "Your biggest drawback is that you don't fight well. Two-color pills can increase your strength, agility and pain. Patience, even if I attack you with a long-range weapon such as a bow, it is not so convenient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean did not take care of each other, he moved to the magic stone Unable to influence the position and concentrate on creating the stone of God. At this time, the mad drug has already taken effect. He feels that his strength is growing rapidly, his vision becomes extremely clear, and Shen Shi’s hand is equal to possessing the most effective weapon to restrain the witch. If she dares to come, she will immediately die in the red fog. Erosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is also constructing their own weapons - what is it? A long sword with both hands? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the bow is well understood, what does she need to do with the sword? Moreover, the shape of the long sword is also very strange. I saw that the sword body is as wide as the body, and there are several spar in the top, which seems to have been seen everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was then a clean up of the weapon in his hand. "Do you know? In the illusion between the reflection churches, the remaining image records are not the only one. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You forgot what Oberlin had said Has the battle of Akaris and Nataya been fully recorded by the Federation," she said one word at a time, "In addition to engulfing, observation and learning are my strengths."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the spar on the sword lights up in turn, as if it is a sign, then a dazzling golden light emerges from the blade, instantly tearing the red fog, straight into the Skyline. As if in response to this power, the sky has also fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is...what ability?" Mayn widened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to him is the golden light that engulfs everything. In an instant, the whole world is disintegrating in this golden light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The cage slowly landed on the ground of the Shenshi Cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo throws the clothes on his shoulders and throws them out of the cage. The whip marks behind her have disappeared as if they had never existed before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-sided trial warrior bowed his head respectfully and handed the golden robes that had already been prepared in his hand—the clothing that symbolized the supreme power of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo put on the obvious robes under the service of the crowd, and did not go back to the secret temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
