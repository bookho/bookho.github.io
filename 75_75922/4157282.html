			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is - memory reading! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference is that they are the memory of Wang Shuo in the dominating of the Holy See, but now it is the consciousness that Heikezod actively instilled his memory into it. in! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence was interrupted for a long time before the connection was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory is difficult to forge, and it is far more precise than the description, but it also has shortcomings that cannot be ignored. It is easy to see things other than "things". Fragment. The open memory is like an undefended city. It did not expect that the Scorpio Lord would choose this way to convey information to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excessive words don't have to be said," Heekzod's voice Very low, obviously this move makes it exhausted. "If you don't, will you believe what I have experienced?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is no doubt will not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small island not far from the Blackrock Field is actually the reality of the source of magic. This is not to say orally, even after reading the memory. It still has a deep sense of unreality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you create your own field of consciousness?" Silence changed the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod looked at it with a puzzled look, "I thought you would first pay attention to the whereabouts of Wakiris. But you guessed it right...if Not so, I can't convey memories to you. When I saw the tree of the light column, I suddenly had a deeper understanding of the ideology. If it wasn't for the interruption of the Tianhai world, I might be able to go further. Of course... ...my field is much smaller than the king's holy seat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out." Silently sitting back to the pool, facing away from the sky Lord, "I really want to know the whereabouts of the monk, even when I saw the note, I can't wait to go to the human kingdom to find it right away - but rationally told me that I must reject your request." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Refused...what?" Heckzod turned over and looked at it from this perspective, just to sweep the smooth back of the opponent and a bunch of drops to Long blue hair in the pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I rarely speak, but it doesn't mean I don't think." Silently said, "You come back to me first, not to report to the king." The purpose is self-evident. You want to stop the battle of God's will, or wait until the truth is over, and then make a decision - this is undoubtedly a violation of the king's will, its essence and betrayal is no different. Once known by the king, it will never I will spare you, and you will be thin and need someone to help you. I am the helper you choose to ask for help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I am absolutely loyal to the king. Heikzod retorted the voice, "Since knowing the battle of God's will is a scam, why should we devote ourselves to it and wait for the end of the destiny? Do you think Wang will go it alone? As long as I find a way to contact Waki Reese, the king will inevitably understand what is the right choice, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ends up, the sound is getting lower and lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, have you seen it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Silently said, " I didn't mean it, but the memory couldn't be screened and omitted like a language. From the moment you left the bottomless world, you know that the king can't agree with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of God is a scam, and the conscious world hides more profound secrets, which does not conflict with the elimination of human beings and the heavens and the sea. Even if the information on the note is true, as long as the fragments are not synthesized, the "upgrade" will not begin, and they have a lot of time to crack the secret. In any case, everything about God's will should be in your own hands. Keeping competitors is extremely dangerous. Indeed, the elimination of human beings may make the nightmare completely disappear into the ideology, but compared to the entire ethnic group, a Maharaja can be said to be insignificant, even if the other is Wakiri. The same is true for silk. The king will not let feelings affect his judgment. The only criterion for acting is only cold logic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the pace of the war is stopped, the speed of human development is likely to make the advantages of the ethnic group disappear, which is what Erskuk has repeatedly emphasized. Never take this risk – Heckzod must know this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since you understand, then shouldn't it be more actionable? Or say--" Heckzod squinted at the nightmare of the other side of Dianchi. "Your respect for Wakiris is pretend, compared to It himself, you would like to see an empty space..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silenced a fist in the Dianchi, causing a few cracks in the stone base, and let the Lord of the Skull close his mouth in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, all your inferences are based on a piece of paper that doesn't know where it came from. It's of course Wakiris's handwriting, but it's just that. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be a sign of the existence of a bottomless state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It also It is not safe to say that God is made, but human beings can't stop our steps." Silently, "For such a note, let me openly violate the will of the king? In fact, I am willing to never I have already taken the corresponding risks after listening to it. If it is yours, I am afraid I can't even do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not what I mean. We can slow down the offensive and investigate in secret, as long as we hold on to the mask..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the second point I want to say, you come back It’s too late.” Silence interrupted it directly. “The king has already sent a new order. The Western Front is responsible for the warfare and implements the second plan. You are no longer the head of the West Line Army. It is said that there will be no Western Line Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come..." Heikezod slammed from Dianchi Station, followed by The face bitched in pain in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should feel it? The ambiguity of the ideology." Silent face expressionless, "In fact, it is much more serious than that, not just abomination." The heart of the war, the black stone domain defense line also announced the collapse. In the critical situation, the king and the core integration, making Wangcheng a new god of God. Now, the entire ethnic group will move to this only remaining place Your vision is not realized at all. If you want to fight for time, you must violate its instructions. This is no different from the blatant confrontation with the king. So I can't promise you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod found that the situation was completely beyond his control. Although the fall of the Majesty was rare, it was not surprising that there was any accident on the battlefield. It was just that it was unexpected, and the situation suddenly deteriorated to this. How much? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the changes in the blades...not a special phenomenon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is natural to know what the second program is -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mask is studying the creation of God When God was there, he mentioned a crazy means of warfare. Without considering the cost, pressing the core and the Shenshi vein to the limit can make the floating land rise to a rather high level. At this time, the huge weight is enough to make it a deadly weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the god of God made a fall from the sky, only the penalty can be compared. Although Heckzod is not sure how terrible it is, but in the face of the mask, the earth will collapse, and the smoke that rises will cover the sky and even spread thousands of miles away. The magma will also erupt from the cracks, making the entire land a living abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An attack consumes a precious god of God, and Heckzod originally could not have achieved the day with this plan. I did not expect that Wang would agree. This practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, its ideas have indeed become empty talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With it alone, stand up against the king? The ethnic group may not be able to move forward, but its fate must be doomed. There is no second possibility except to be pursued by other monarchs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you are right..." Heikezod slowly regained his back in the pool. "I thought it was too bad and almost committed." Wrong. Since I have already transferred to the second program, I should also return to Tianzhu City to arrange the follow-up..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another crack appeared on the wall of the pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Heaven is surprised to remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
