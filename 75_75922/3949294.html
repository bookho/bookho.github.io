Over the mountains, cross over How far can the river escape from the gates of Hell. But next time, where can we escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Roland closed the book of illusion and asked the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the Cavalier remembers correctly, this is a very coincidence." The book was indulged for a moment, "The contents of the treasure map and the records in ancient books." The essays are consistent, which can be said to prove from the side that the church once built a city in the depths of the wild to resist the devil. The maps are marked by the defense towers, posts, warehouses or other facilities they built. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean...is it not a real treasure map?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the church is not a thief or a pirate. They don't have to hide their treasures, and they leave a drawing for the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded, "That's right. So... is this actually a map?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten have **. Although it is not clear why the church did not history this period It’s recorded, but I’m sure there’s more than one burial in the East Forest.” The book analyzes, “If this place The marked facility is just a building on the ground, and it is hard to leave anything after hundreds of years. If it comes with a storage warehouse like a basement, it is probably another underground relic. Through it, we may find some clues. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What clues?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why does the church want to conceal the existence of the devil? Why did they resist the devil, but they were as deep as they were?" She paused and her voice was low. "And... why do they want to use the witch as a demon to hunt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp;Roland did not know how to comfort, but had to silence for a while, then slowly began to open the way. "Unfortunately, he did not know that his painting was accurate. Listening to his statement, the original picture was not like hand-painted. General."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to let the nightingale go to the Knight's house?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Not quite right,” Roland vetoed. “The family that can pass a treasure map for hundreds of years, may be in the storage room. It is covered with stones and traps of God's punishment. I will talk about it later," he said with his fingers longer than the sides of the triangle. "We can't reach this place anyway. If you think of this point at the foot of the North Slope as a mining area. The position of the six-pointed star is at least fifty kilometers away from us, almost the distance from the border town to the long song fortress. Except that lightning can arrive within one day, everyone else has to walk for two or three days. What should I do if I encounter the devil on the way... I don't want you to have any mistakes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can let the lightning probe the woodland from the air, maybe you can find something." "The book proposes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a viable option. Roland stood up. "When she comes back, I will tell her." Now I am going to go to the North Slope Mine. You are ready to use the teaching materials to be taught. If you need to copy more copies, you will find Soroya. You have to continue to teach them tonight. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland combines the enlightenment teaching he received in elementary school with the court teaching of the Four Princes, and instilled it in the book, including classified memory and phonetic reading. Write and memorize the phrase. With this, he believes that the other party will become a good teacher.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness. "Book roll ceremony.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The backyard of the firing room in the North Slope Mine is now more than twice as large as before, and there are still two excavated and unfilled on the ground. The hole, the 12-pound gun's artillery was cast here. When Roland arrived in the backyard, Anna was practicing her new abilities, and there were two finished products that looked like steel pipes.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up a hand and looked at it. The steel pipe was round and the surface without holes was flat and smooth. The round hole in the middle was the same as the outer wall. In the high-gloss area, Roland used the nail to clamp the wall thickness at both ends of the card and found that it was basically the same.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was amazed, "How did you make this? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
