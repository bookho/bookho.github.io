			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Anytime?" The guards groaned, "That is now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an answer to aristocratic etiquette. According to the rules, he should first ask the other person to rest for a day or two before holding another one. A sumptuous banquet. If you are not so particular, at least you have to agree on a time, such as the evening - after all, the other party represents the king of the gray castle, Zheng is not overemphasized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the baron didn’t want to wait for a moment, if it’s not too unruly, it’s raining outside, he even wants to take the initiative to go to the dock. Undoubtedly, such a large fleet will inevitably attract the attention of the "fangs" and "Red Stone Gate" missions. If they are allowed to contact the other party first, then the matter will be complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," thought of this, let. Bate quickly added to the guards, "You talk to the Grey Fortress about the other two families. It is said that Shenchiwan can be the master, only me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After the guards left, the baron suddenly regretted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it should not be said at any time, in case the other party follows the etiquette, what should I do after one or two days? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, it’s the self-esteem of the bottom of my heart. It should be more straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rain is not coming late, but at this time, it’s just like being against yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baron looked at the heavy rain outside the window and was caught in a tangle. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the guard came back faster than he had imagined, and it took less than half an hour before and after, and it also brought news that made him happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, they are coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let. Bate slammed from the seat Get up, "Come, take them to my meeting room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baron Soon, I saw the Grey Castle visitors in the hall of the Governor's Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many people, only a total of ten, half of them are probably guards, standing directly outside the door. The rest of the people dressed more formal, probably a character like a paper assistant, and sitting in the middle should be the spokesperson of the king of the gray castle. He noticed a detail, that is, the jacket that the other person took off and hung on the wall seemed to have a waterproof effect. Even if there was such a heavy rain outside, there was no wet marks on the people, and the coat was bright and bright, neither leather nor felt. Obviously a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it is not a false statement that many more things in the past few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he carefully looked at the person in charge, he frowned in the darkness - it was clearly a Mojinshamin. Such barbarians generally appear in the slave market, how to become the upper class of the gray fort? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the long-term literacy has made the baron not reveal his surprise on his face. He piles up a warm smile and opens his hands. “I am The lord of Shenchi Bay, Baron Bet. As you can see, the city is bustling and beautiful, and it is very suitable as a place to rest after the voyage. I wonder if you come from afar, what is it?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gesture is considered to be low enough, even if the other party is a duke, it should be accepted with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no fluctuation on the face of Momojin. "My name is Iron Axe, and the commander of the First Army is also the person in charge of this expedition. Exempted, let us make a long story short, Yongdong and the wolf heart kingdom are likely to become a battlefield full of blood and death, I am the king of the Grey Fort, the chief of the Mojin, the ruler of the fertile plains, Roland Wimbledon To save the people here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What...the situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let. Bate sometimes doubts his ears, big...the chief? What is the title? Where is the fertile plain? Putting aside these fine details, turning the winter and the wolf into a battlefield is a threat of force? The question is, what did you say at the beginning? Generally, shouldn’t you put it after your refusal? But he still didn't ask himself if he couldn't agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the clerk received the words. "Excuse me... Is the First Army the army that defeated the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly." Mo Jinren Nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Axe Axe, we naturally don't want the war to spread to this land, but this is not a city in Shenchi Bay. It is always hoped." Get more, if you can convince them, the wolf will not become a battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good job! The baron secretly said that in this way, the other two families would naturally be dragged into the water. He nodded as a regrettable look, looking at the iron axe, but accidentally caught a trace of sarcasm on the other's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will not be up to you to become a battlefield. When the enemy comes, the entire human race will fight for it. In fact, the war has begun." In places you don't know." The iron axe said faintly. "I think you should have heard more or less rumors about the church, about the gods, and the news of the aliens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let. Bate stunned, as the lord of the harbour, he did hear similar words, the maritime merchants have gone to more places, always see some weird things, but These are just talks on the table, and it is not appropriate to get a formal diplomatic occasion. However, there is no banter in the tone of the other party. Is it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, these are true." Iron Axe said one word at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a thunder in the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wow, is this group of people doing iron?" On the fence of the stables, look at the direction of the pier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if iron is rusting, I don’t think they are people at all." White wiped the rain on the horse and took time to take care of himself. Wet clothes. "Which normal people will deliberately shower? Only idiots and madmen are exceptions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just over half an hour, from the boat Hundreds of people quickly took control of the entire port, and the traders evacuated before the storm, but they did the opposite, setting up one tent after another in the middle of the empty space. In a twinkling of an eye, this dark green shed is full of more than half of the pier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Grey Fortress also piled up obstacles at intersections and higher places, and some thick metal pipes were racked up. They don't look like weapons, otherwise they won't let them be exposed to the rain. They can look at the cold black reflections. White always has a feeling of uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before each such "level", there are people stationed. Although they are covered with a rain cloak that covers the whole body, it is impossible to isolate rainwater in such weather. The sea breeze that passes through the port from time to time will blow the heavy rain and fill it into the collar and cuffs. The gaps in the class can be said to be a breeze, and White can already imagine the appearance of their clothes being soaked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling is definitely very uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinking bay was wet and rainy, and the local lords also set up a number of temporary shelters in the dock area, but this group of people seems to care less, don’t Said to go to hide from the rain, not even look at it, plus a dark cloak, it is like a piece of stone standing in the rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fortress is crazy... White muttered in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, weird," the clever ghost suddenly whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" White didn't have a good air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see the ship they are carrying goods, and then look at those outside the port-" he pointed out, "all of them are three Sailing, draught is a little too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drinking? So what it means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You will be the standard for measuring the amount of loading," said the little devil. "Even if it has been unloaded so much, its draught is still much deeper than the outside. It is difficult to understand... What is it for doing this? Is it just to deliberately create momentum?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
