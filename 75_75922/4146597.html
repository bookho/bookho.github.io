			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two soldiers quickly approached the newly emergent enemy and buckled the trigger against the devil grenade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two smoky smoky shots from behind the bunker, flying towards the giant spiders - so eye-catching, almost impossible to miss . Looking at the trail of the grenade, Sang Shu felt his heart lifted up. He always felt that the thick carapace on the other side of the body was not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bad pre-test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grenade was released from the side and hit the ground directly after hitting the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one was facing the front leg on its front, and the explosion ignited a thick smoke, but the action of the devil did not stop. Just a slight meal, it crossed out from the smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stupid, shoot the body!" The man couldn't help but groan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me try!" Another person volunteered to pick up a box of warheads and climbed out of the trenches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang Shu did not stop, but not as optimistic as other people, he now understands, where is the strange feeling of the new spider magic - compared to the manual On those irregular ugly monsters, this beast is much more coordinated. The "armor" on its limbs is not a random pile of stone, but a regular multi-faceted prism. If you tuck it together, you might be able to put a trapezoidal table that fits up and down with the stone on the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the other side is moving, the range of limb changes is quite large, which makes it difficult for soldiers to accurately hit the torso or abdomen. Losing is not accidental. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the next few grenades failed to stop the action of the spider magic, and even after the fire of the shooting tube, it will deliberately close the body, simply It is like conditioned reflection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the gap that was knocked out by the enemy, there was a figure of the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hell, can these guys not be able to play on time?" The machine gunner complained as he turned his gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough!" Sang Shu immediately broke the road, "Retreat to the second line of defense, give this area to them! Prepare to detonate the explosive." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is good," he shouted. "If The side was surrounded by enemies, and we couldn’t walk anymore!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound quickly resounded, and the nail squad alternately covered the training chart to the port terminal. Retreat. While the refugees watched the monster approaching, the queue began to panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldier in charge of the detonation handed the detonating line to the hand motor and swung it up quickly. "Captain, you can detonate at any time!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, let it taste the taste of explosives." Sang Shu stared at the rampage of the terrible, and reached out and said, "Wait again... is now-" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the soldiers slammed down the detonating rod, more than a dozen dull bangs came into the ears of everyone! In an instant, the earth beneath the feet seemed to tremble, and a series of rising columns almost filled the entire open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the piles of explosives was buried under the spider's body, and the violent impact made it half of the body, and the stone armor on both feet suddenly became heavy. The burden is that the living is pulled off the joint. When it comes back, it has no movement ability, like a beast that has been blown up by the legs, leaning down on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a whistle in the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not yet waiting for everyone to breathe a sigh of relief, the same impact on the east side of the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other spider magic suddenly appeared on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Sang Shuqing fortunately made the most correct choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
