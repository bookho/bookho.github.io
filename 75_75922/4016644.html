			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Winter City, outskirts of the West Wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge roar has attracted many people to climb the wall and pick up the crowd. The first army has blocked the entrance to the hidden forest to avoid people breaking into it. Test site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the location is far from the city wall, with the lookout mirror, you can clearly see what happened here. It seems that I have to find a remote place as a dedicated arms test base in the future, Roland thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, the second round of launch is ready!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone goes into the bunker," he waved. "Recognize no one and count down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Now it is the 152mm howitzer test - while studying the magic stone seal, Roland has not put down the improvement of the hot weapon. Now that Tefco has been destroyed, the Northland has declared its return, and the situation in the Grey Fort is very good. He has also worked hard to make a new round of improvements to the shells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s hard to say that the howitzer with the trigger fuze is technically more difficult than the solid bullet. Anna makes four shells per day for the artillery. The test, the results of three days down, no shells successfully exploded, even in the next day of testing, a shell directly blew out the flowers, so that the new artillery tubes used for testing were smashed. Fortunately, Roland was prepared to dig a few trenches around the test site to prevent accidents, and no casualties were caused. As for the soldiers who were closest to the artillery, the eardrum was broken and Na Nava was cured in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this thing really like you said, when you hit an enemy, it will explode?" Ai Gesha stood in the trench and couldn't help but visit. "I asked." Anna, it is composed of several pieces of metal, not a living body. How can we tell if the other is an enemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a weapon test in the league The most active witch, after learning of this incident, even temporarily put aside the production of the chemical plant, and made a special trip to observe the research progress of the new projectile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not an enemy, but an enemy’s position that will explode,” Roland corrected. “This is also a requirement that the howitzer must meet—if If there is no insurance to ensure this, the shells may go away at any time, which is too dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Triggering insurance is the core technology of the new shells. It is also the focus of the test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid collisions, missed hands and caused a false explosion, he painstakingly set up a total of three insurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that the fuse is separated from the shell and stored and transported until it is installed on site - the fuse is shaped like a cone with a handle, almost the size of the fist, and the tail It is threaded and can be screwed into the slot of the top of the projectile during installation, which is quick and convenient. Since the shells are loaded with double-base chemical gunpowder, it is difficult to detonate without the detonator, which fundamentally guarantees the safety of the logistics work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the inertia insurance in the fuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is similar to a door lock. Under normal conditions, it is held by a hard spring and cannot move. When the projectile is fired, the huge inertia causes the lock cylinder to sit back. Overcome the resistance of the spring to open the latch and release the second pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle is very simple, but it is not easy to achieve, the first two days are basically spent on this - if the spring is too hard, the lock core can not sit back Sufficient distance, the spring is too soft and not safe enough. This can only be adjusted slowly by Anna according to the test situation. After eight rounds of test, a more reliable spring compression data is obtained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last insurance is a centrifugal detonator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also the most technically interesting thing in the fuse. Simply put, the detonator is embedded in a coin-sized semi-circular iron plate, which is usually tilted. The center of the fuse is fixed by a spring. At this moment, the needle, the detonator, and the stimulating medicine are not in a straight line. Even if the shell falls from a high place, the striker does not touch the detonator and avoids the risk of fire. The iron plate is only movable after the second insurance card has been released from the lock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the action of the barrel of the barrel, the shrapnel will spin at a very high speed, and under the action of the centrifugal force, the inclined detonator will gradually return to the positive direction. Like the rotating gyro, the center of gravity moves closer to the center axis. This process is completed approximately two or three hundred meters after the exit, so that even if the muzzle is blocked or the branches are covered, the warhead will not explode in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
