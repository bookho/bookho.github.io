			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one week, the information sent back by the First Army not only confirmed the news that the red fog appeared north of Yongdong, but also let Luo Lan’s evacuation Have a general understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, as Isis predicted, the devil did not wait until the red fog spread completely into the perpetual winter, and they used the supply line to shorten the timing, from multiple The direction is to attack humans and hand in hand to the first army's militant forces - apparently, they have waited for this moment for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics obtained from the Iron Axe are not optimistic. In the process of evacuating the refugees, several detachments were defeated by sudden attacks, the retreat became a rout, and the soldiers were dispersed by the panicked people. At present, the number of casualties has been determined to exceed 300. It is almost equivalent to the casualties of the Taichung attack in the night of the expedition. The number of migrants is over 10,000, which is a heavy loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy’s swift action clearly caught everyone off guard. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first advancement of the first army to shift the population is more efficient, but it also reduces its combat capability. Fortunately, Roland has instilled in the army early on the idea of ​​saving as much as possible, non-human failure, grassroots officers and soldiers should not be punished, and broken. The soldiers finally did not turn to be a soldier, but they continued to retreat into the wolf heart kingdom and reconnected to the garrison. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, once the command system was defeated, it would never be recovered. The army in the north of Yongdong was afraid that it would be wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The escaped soldiers not only quickly formed new combat capabilities, but also brought extremely important information to the command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there are multiple detachment reports, and they found the staggers that were not recorded in the manual during the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team that successfully evacuated from Yongdong North Port mentioned that the devil had invested in a new spider-type beast when attacking. The two types are greatly increased, and mortars and anti-devil grenade are difficult to take action. Only 152mm cannons can cause effective damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other types of territories have only a shape description, and the specific ability is not known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is undoubtedly accelerating the maturity of this terrible devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of intelligence, the high-level meeting has been opened several times, and the ministers agreed to dispatch the army as soon as possible to block the enemy and gain time for the transfer of the two populations. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the rapid growth of the winterless population, the increasing workforce, has given officials a taste of sweetness - except for the police department and the security bureau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also thinks that it is a pity that the capacity of the Grey Fort has reached its limit. He wants to send tens of thousands of people to the wolf in one breath, and the ammunition equipment can’t keep up. no good. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even though the dispatch order has been issued, the assembly of the large forces is a long process, which is different from the expedition to Takira, which follows from the very beginning. The railway line is propelled, and the Heihe train and the leaves provide supplies no matter where they are. Now, before the new transportation equipment is rolled out, the General Staff Department can only think of other methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point in the report that caught his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team that was successfully evacuated was able to get out of the way because of the support of the shallow-water gunship; and the reason why Roland was able to arrive in time was because Yi and Carol temporarily for the ordinary people to throw away the magic core of what they regard as priceless treasure. This change in perception made Roland realize that the ancient witch might make the relics of the underground civilization play a greater role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went directly to the three high-level witches of Takira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the light curtain, Pasha, Elsie, and Celine’s tentacle body appeared on the wall of the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland succinctly said his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
