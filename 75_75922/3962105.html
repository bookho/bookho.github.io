			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a day to return to the border area. Roland felt a backache and went to sleep early. After the next day, it was close to noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there must be a soundproof cabin and a soft recliner on the special ship. He thought that it would be better to have a large bed. Otherwise, sitting on the hard bench that is constantly shaking, listening to the repeated roar of the steam engine, it is a double torture to the spirit and the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the office, Roland’s first thing was to recruit the general manager Barov Mons and the Minister of Agriculture Sene Dali, now from the spring The scheduled time for the offensive is only the last week. The army has an iron-axe grasp. He is very reassured. Therefore, the most important thing is to do a good job in agricultural production and do a good job in spring work. After all, you can have the food in your heart. Panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen the seeds of the past in Changge Wharf. As long as there is gold one, the harvest on the other side of this year will not be worse. But Bentham District is the key point. We are role models, proofs, and examples of propaganda for everyone!” He tapped the table. “So, how is the spring plowing work done? Who said it?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, the current situation is like this," Barov took the lead. "There are only three adults in the first group of serfs who are willing to continue farming. The newly recruited serfs now have a total agricultural population of around 10,000. According to the average wheat yield of the previous year, the food produced by this 10,000 people should be able to feed four to five thousand people." He paused and added that "I said that the feeding is based on the amount of wheat purchased by the official residents. This number is much larger than the daily consumption of civilians in other cities. If you only ask not to starve, you can add another 20,000."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is roughly the case, Your Highness," "According to the above conclusions, the above conclusions are based on the statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture. According to the statistics of the previous year, about half of the serfs this year - mainly the newly added batch of gold No. 2 that will use the leaf adults to improve ... really, if not I have witnessed it, I can't believe that there are so many wheat ears on the straw, and there are still two thousand people who will replant potatoes and corn, so I can't predict the actual actual output."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the farming part, the farmland is currently being ploughed. According to the previously prepared crop planting manual, the field needs to be ploughed three times repeatedly, and the fermented compost is mixed into it. This process usually takes three to four weeks, depending on the number of people working in the field and the farm tools used. The serfs of the previous year basically rented iron tools and should be able to shorten the time of ploughing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the depth of the ditch and the spacing of the seeds, I have arranged apprentices to give propaganda and teach them to plant according to the best method in the planting manual."<br /><b r />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the knight of the original rushing wolf has made a lot of effort on the farming. The aspects that need to be taken into consideration are considered to be the head. Even Roland can’t help but nod. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This era of agricultural underdevelopment is too dependent on the land itself, a field is equivalent to planting all, in order to protect the field, even have to plough a year off two In the year, land use efficiency is extremely low. Nowadays, without winter city, with controlled irrigation, natural fertilizer and reasonable planting methods, and the seeds of leaf transformation, the output is naturally high in the eyes of local people. However, for Roland, there are more than 10,000 people in the total population of 30,000 who are engaged in planting agriculture. This ratio is still too high. The next most effective way to reduce the agricultural population is to start with agricultural tools, such as manufacturing agricultural equipment that uses animal power or mechanical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, keep the momentum going," he said with satisfaction. "The other people who are sent to the Changge District should also make a record. If there is any To be promoted to other cities, it will be executed in this mode."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After processing the agricultural affairs, Roland left the castle and accompanied by the nightingale and guards to Chishui River dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vessel, which was under construction by Anna, entered the weapon installation stage two days ago, and only the hull coated with gray-red two-color anti-corrosion coating stood still. On the sleepers, there are three cement boat-sized hulls that look very burly. Unlike a cement paddle boat without a cabin, its side is close to two meters, which can fully insert the boiler and steam engine into the abdomen, and the two ribs also cancel the paddle wheel. In addition, it is characterized by a raised bridge in the center of the hull. Although it is only one storey high, it still looks very eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as a shallow water gunship, the most important equipment is undoubtedly the 152mm cannon. In order to save construction time, Roland did not let Anna make the naval gun version alone, but removed the fortress gun on the wall and planned to go directly to the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
