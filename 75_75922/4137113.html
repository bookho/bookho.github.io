			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the eyes with a little questioning and questioning, Roland thought of it, this guy’s appearance when he was blaming is also very cute... I rarely call my brother. When I am in front of an outsider or when I am annoyed, I will hang my brother in my mouth. People have a kind of idea that they can't help but want to trick her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough, not right, now is not the time to consider this question... He coughed twice and pulled his thoughts back on track. "The aircraft is not yet fully finalized. So every part has to be made by Anna and Soroya. Now the frontline war is just around the corner, how heavy their work is, you should be clearer than most people. Although I have completed the design drawings very early, If you want to turn it into reality, you can't do it alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the extension of the railway, the interval between the seagull and the front line is also The first one or two days became three or four days - not that Tilly and Wendy wanted to be lazy, but that a lot of combat preparation work was difficult to complete in one day, and there was no alternative to extending the residence time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a pick-up, Tilly naturally knows how hard everyone is, and when she is on the plane, she falls asleep directly on the seat. Replace the more comfortable cushion and backrest. And defeating the devil and retaking the fertile plains is the most important goal at the moment. When it comes to this, her momentum has been cut a bit, and the body on the desk has shrunk back. "I also want to start flying early, so that The empty knight can come in handy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, in fact, the aircraft body has been basically completed, only some accessories are not installed, so you just have to be patient - —”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Wait,” Tilly interrupted. “The meaning of the ontology is... can you fly without those parts?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Roland realized that he said that he had missed his mouth. At this time, the five kings are no longer the layman who knows nothing about the plane. It is not an easy task to pass through. "...not to say no, but it is essentially different from the Seagull. If there is a problem, Wendy can't help correct it, once the operation is wrong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He said that he gradually closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Tilly’s glorious eyes have already explained everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really can't refuse such a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale behind him has already laughed softly, and she seems to be very happy to see his speechlessness recently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Roland sighed. "Well, I will inform the airport people to prepare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the right thing." Tilly's eyebrows finally fell, and the corner of his mouth showed a reassurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called, "But remember, if there is an accident during the flight test, or if you lose control, you must give up the plane for the first time, understand?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, because the plane can be rebuilt, and pilots like me are precious," Tilly said with her arms in her arms. "You think so." Yes, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No winter flight base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was just a simple concrete open space. There was nothing but two runways, but it is now a veritable flight training ground and a future Air Force Academy. Embryo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the closed test field of the wall, a silvery plane was launched by the workers from the hangar and placed at the end of the runway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly took a deep breath, "That is...made for me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well," Roland nodded. "Unicorn. The main power is provided by a five-cylinder star piston engine. In theory, the aircraft can speed more than 150 kilometers per hour, even the fastest. There is no way to catch up with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Autonomous powercraft built as the first person of the era, it has a great appearance and the Seagull glider The difference - the most obvious is the huge head. In order to install the engine, the nose can only abandon the aerodynamic appearance of the streamline, and it is made into a less beautiful iron bucket, which looks like it has been flattened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
