			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Thunder raised his doubts, Roland couldn’t help but tilt his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that this explorer really can see the essence of the problem - according to the standards of the manual era, the price of any large pile of industrial products It can be counted as a high price, but he certainly will not charge according to the blacksmith's forging cost, otherwise it will hurt the feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if it wasn’t for the absence of a new batch of steelmaking equipment after the success of the converter experiment, there would be no way to promote steel ships and tracks at the same time. These two major projects of the train. The steel-making plant that has left the witch has now entered a benign development stage, taking iron from the blast furnace area, taking charcoal from the coking tower, and then releasing the molten steel into a furnace, and the whole process has been realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the various workers in the large factory, the rest are all auxiliary machinery driven by steam engines. The water vapor that is tumbling is often mixed with floating dust to form a north. The unique environment of Poshan - fog. If you stand in the middle of the city and look up to the desperate mountains, you can see a group of "grey clouds" that cover the mountainside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With steel mills running at full capacity, the steel produced in one day is higher than the annual output of a city, which is the basis for all industrial projects without winter city. . On this basis, everything will undergo qualitative changes, but few people can truly understand the meaning behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The price can be discussed later, but I guarantee it is much less than the lowest price you think," Roland smiled. "Because that is not I have said that the development of new sea areas is of great significance to all mankind. As the king of the Grey Fort, it is naturally willing to contribute to this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thunder is moving, "Your vision makes me admire... Few people are willing to spend money in places that they can't see. Even in the fjord, the Chamber of Commerce prefers new routes that bring benefits. Although you I can't get involved in the game, but this idea has already surpassed many explorers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with what you thought I was talking about in the old king? ? Roland thought in his heart that if he wanted to understand the desires of the world, no one would be able to compare himself. After all, it may be related to the source of the battle of divineity and the secret hidden behind the scenes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Compared to this, let's go on board and check it out." He smiled and changed the subject. "Since it is here, I will take you." It’s good to visit it from start to finish.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's great, sire!" Thunder replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This steel ship can be said because there is no ready-made information for reference. It is a collection of classic ship types. It can also be said to be four. Its first half is similar to the iron armor. The ship's head is slanted outside and the waterline is equipped with a corner. The middle section is rapidly widened to obtain as high a sea condition as possible. Stability; the stern is a flat tail, similar to modern ships, with a total tonnage of around 2,500 tons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has also thought about adding some black technology to improve its performance, such as the ball nose and fins, but the former needs to be designed separately according to the ship type and speed. The latter requires a complex mechanical linkage structure to adjust the angle, taking into account the schedule, reliability and other factors, he eventually gave up these choices far beyond the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean that it is an enlarged version of the Roland's shallow-water heavy gunship, just the core of its power – a steam turbine assembled by Anna. It is something that Thunder and others can't understand. In addition, the hand-cranked telephone was used for the first time in cabin communication. Several lines connected the command post, the engine room and the watchtower. Compared with the sound tube that is good or bad in effect, even if the sea is noisy, The captain can also clearly hear the reports of various units. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is worth mentioning that these hand-cranked phones are equipped with a magical Dawning Mini power supply, which is enough to support an extra long time adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is simply...unbelievable," after visiting the complete ship, the Thunder stood in the towering bridge with a clear window. "I even think she is not a ship." The sea boat is a movable sea fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This changed the title, Roland laughed a few times, "How, I didn't let you Disappointed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
