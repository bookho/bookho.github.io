			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred spent a while before recovering from dizziness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His vision is blurred, his face is burning and it is difficult to open his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, say good aristocratic fights don’t face? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong effort, he slowly sat up from the ground, and moved a little to the two frightened women, pulling out the rags in their mouths. "Don't be afraid, wait for me to catch your breath and untie the ropes on your body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two didn't even dare to breathe, just nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he paused for a longer time before he accumulated enough power to loosen the rope. "Well, you can go. Be careful not to be caught by that guy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy should have no chance, wait until the ship is full When people leave Hong Kong, they should be able to bump into the migrants wherever they go. In the face of everyone's work, the other party estimates that there is no such guts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unrestrained woman carefully bypassed him, then hurriedly ran out of the utility room - the rapid footsteps gradually drifted away, and finally returned to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From beginning to end, they still have not said a word, including thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred leaned against the wall and slowly took a breath, and somehow there was a sudden explanation of the driver’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said kid, don't always think of yourself as a good person, especially outside... or sooner or later, one day, you have to suffer big losses." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and left these distractions behind his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a situation, I have long been used to it, isn’t it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only hope that you can return to the assigned cabin before the official start, not to be occupied by the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Manfred heard the fine steps and came again, and the sound of the "Oops" of the board was moving closer to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, that is not the case for Mai Jinli? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps stopped at the door of the utility room, and the door was pushed open, and a head came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred stunned, and the one who came to escape was one of the women who escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the door opened, he found that both of them were actually there - and the one standing behind was struggling with a wooden barrel, and the action was hard It’s like putting all the strength out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the bucket was placed in front of him, he noticed that it was filled with clear water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them took out a handkerchief and wiped it gently after damp The blood on his face, the other person apologized, "Hold, sorry, you are beaten like this. We were so scared at the time, so I couldn’t say a word... because, because... you said I am also a nobleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred couldn’t help but laugh out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t want to control his expression even if he is stinging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what's wrong with you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't say it?" Interrupted the other party's words, "From the moment of boarding the ship, there is no longer a difference between slaves and nobility - because the king of the gray castle not only canceled the slave status, but also recovered all the aristocratic powers. In other words, we It’s the same person.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Manfred is not unaware that there is no knight in the gray fort – merchants from all over the country The news was passed to the wolf heart. In the eyes of most nobles, this was a big mistake, but he left a little attention to Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his father was still there, he never thought about this problem, and thought that it was only a matter of time before he could inherit this identity. However, when the territory was annexed by the various forces, Manfred found that things had become unexpected. The new lord turned a blind eye to him. Those who were obviously not qualified became high, except for a surname. It seems like nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the ancient books, the pioneers who pioneered selected the most outstanding representatives of them as kings, and Wang gave them the status and honor of heroic warriors and defended them together. Home and the people, this is the origin of the title. The Cavaliers, as the closest to the bottom, should be humble and compassionate, and at the same time upholding justice and integrity, the territory will flourish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the qualities that these ordinary people do not have, they are even more sublime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the person Manverd always wanted to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now he can't figure out what the Cavaliers are like from ordinary people after they have no land. Does it mean that those who are noble are those extraordinary spirits, or is it a title deed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the battle of power and interests, the sites of the big lords are changing every day. The people around them can be knights, idiots can be knights, but He could not do without land alone, which made him doubt the so-called "Knight class." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the family did not fall behind and suffered various setbacks, Manfred’s goal has not changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be said that he had the idea of ​​going to the Grey Fort. The only thing missing was the toll. Later, the Grey Fortress took the initiative to enter the wolf heart. A best opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to know if he can become a knight in a place where there is no longer a nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the phrase "we are the same person", the two women’s expressions have obviously relaxed a lot. "Really... is that true?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was spread in the aristocratic circle a few months ago, and those big families would like to say that Wimbledon is the devil from hell." Fuld smiled grinningly. "But now, they probably have to go to the most terrible devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who wiped him was silent for a moment "Why are you helping us? Don't you be afraid of being a nobleman..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He didn't dare to die, because I have already reminded him. Manfard shook his head. "I don't know how the Grey Fortress will review it. But I heard that a witch is involved. It is absolutely impossible to lie. Even if he does not think that you are a crime, you can kill it." Another aristocrat is absolutely a crime that cannot be ignored. He knows this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he was breathing here. "Right, my name is Manfred Kastein, what about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really interesting, this is his fourth time today’s name. Right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is 黛兰," the other whispered. "She is Momo." She paused and seemed to be determined, "The noble said It’s all true, we’ve been sold to —”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ve said that it’s all on board, not to mention it. Question." Manfred waved his hand. "As the coachman who sent me here said, no matter how good it was before, there must be a new life to live with us - if not, we will not Determined to leave the wolf heart and go to a distant strange land, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜—————————————— ————”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the long and thick horn sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time to set off is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back, if the position is occupied, you can be in trouble." He stood up and stood up, although he still hurts a lot, but barely walks There should be no problem with the return room. "I am the same, for such a long distance, I don't want to sleep in the utility room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two women look at each other, After hesitating for a moment, Woodlands took out a white ball from his pocket and handed it to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
