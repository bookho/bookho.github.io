			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dim dungeon, the fire illuminates the hanging figures on the wall like a forked tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No struggle, no pain or begging for mercy, only when the whip is interlaced, the shadow will be shaken twice in an inertial manner, and at the same time it will sound low Low contempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this scorn will soon be overshadowed by the next whips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow of the shadows overlaps with the swaying fire, and the dull whipping seems to be the only sound in this silent dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until more than ten whip, Earl Lorenzo said, "Enough, stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." The executioner quickly retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman hanging on the armor has a scarlet back, and the criss-crossed welts are new and old, obviously not the first time. From the point of view of her nose and arms that she sweated a little, the pain was not ineffective, but the other party pressed all the voices into the bottom of her heart with willpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, are you not going to say the whereabouts of the Holy Scriptures?" He walked over to the woman, reaching for her chin and forcing her face Up - that is the rare beauty face of the trial army, even if it is tortured in prison, it does not make it eclipse. In other words, in the flickering light, her sweaty skin and the same bright eyelids add a touch of color. "The church is finished, Farina, when do you want to be against me? Even if you don't think for yourself, think about those captured companions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This group of damn funeral dogs, Lorenzo hate to think, the wolf is so big, have to go with Dagong Island, is it not clear enough to execute the messengers? Holding a team of godly warriors, as long as you don't want to provoke the gray castle, where to find a place to live a happy life, actually want to murder him? If it wasn’t for the first time, I’ve asked a few people from Mae’s Majesty, but I’m afraid that his head is now hanging on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, his missing left ear burst into pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two gods were in a mixed battle, they almost cut a sword on his neck, which was Farina’s. Fortunately, she was close to exhaustion, and the sword was disturbed by her men, eventually cutting off only half of his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you only get a little trauma, it’s even more so that Lorenzo’s fire is that twenty of the gods who have been saved by themselves are now able to move. There are only two or three people left, and the rest are not reimbursed in the death squad, that is, lack of arms and legs, it is almost impossible to use it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his capital on the island of Dagong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of wolves and aristocrats did not find him to settle accounts after the fall, not because he changed his face, from the bishop to the nobility, but the strength is limited, in the punishment of the samurai I dare not shake before. If the news leaks, I am afraid that the position of the count will be difficult to sit still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo can’t wait to slap the other side to vent their hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he can't do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Before knowing the whereabouts of the Holy Scriptures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if the church is finished, but you must be finished... Count Lorenzo, no, I should call you a traitor." For a while, Farina whispered, "It is my fault to count the lesser warriors you have, but you can't use a few more, right? Otherwise, you won't be so eager to ask the holy." Where is the code. You want to know the secrets of the Pope's heritage - the manufacturing methods of the Gods' Penalty to maintain your poor position -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A crisp slap in the face interrupted her sarcasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trace of blood came out of the corner of Farina, "I don't know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's really a pity," Earl looked at the executioner, "Give me Cut a leg over, anyone can do it, I want to let this monk's companion..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't play," Farina is weak, The tone is full of irony. "Remember the finger that you sent back last time? The blood is solidified and discolored. Do you want to use it to threaten me? It seems that the bishop's life is too comfortable, and you forget the living. The difference with the dead - it was cut from the body, is it right? You have killed them, traitors!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo His face sank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I am not even a proxy to the Pope, how could I have come into contact with the Holy Scriptures? Tucker Thor may know, but he never mentioned it to me. After this, there is no one in the world who knows how to cultivate the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You lie!" He said with a blue face, "Tower Isn’t you letting you come to the wolf, isn’t it to rebuild the church to report the revenge of Hermes? If there is no holy script, why should the church confront the Grey Fort?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..." Farina laughed out loudly. "There is no way for the gods to fight against the gray fortune. The acting pope is just trying to keep everyone's life and let the rest of them live." "The rest of the life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's ridiculous! Do you think I can believe?" The count whispered. "Since it is the rest of Anduo, why bother to attack Dagong Island? Not for the coins, food, armor and weapons that are hoarded here! Tucker gave you the gods and warriors, but you said that he just wants you to live well? This is simply "Ultimate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't believe it, there is no way, the truth is," Farina said. "I want to tell you something." If you don't kill the messengers at the beginning, but you can't say goodbye, we are not a big island. But you have made the worst choice. To know that I hate the most is a traitor with two sides and three knives. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have failed the trust of Oberlin It’s not worth enjoying the rest of the life that Tucker Troll sacrificed for himself.” She said sternly, “It’s a pity that you can’t kill you personally, but the wolf’s nobility will soon discover your bluff – even if it’s off Going to the coat of the Holy City, you will never be their kind! You are just a traitor, not far from the end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo Take a deep breath and try to calm down the anger in your heart. "You are so irritated to me, I want you to kill you, so as not to leak the news of the Holy Scriptures." Rest assured, I am not so easy to be fooled. I know that there are not only the materials accumulated during the sweeping of the wolf, but also a lot of torture tools - used to torture the witches. I don't know if you are performing compared to those who have fallen. How much better?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the other side’s bare feet, “I’m starting from the toenails...and I’m pulling them out. I hope that you can still stick to your previous answer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the castle hall, the count can no longer endure the anger , sweeping the tea on the table to the ground!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, damn, damn Farina!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although he is confident, he knows when she can hold on to the trial army. These cans are usually not in the oil, and it is not so easy to open her mouth.<br /><大 &&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong Island cannot suddenly close the route and ban trade, it will only cause suspicion of the forces of the parties, and if the status quo is maintained, those businessmen are the best eyeliner of the nobility. He urgently needs to be able to The force to fill the gap in God's penalty, before everything is too bad to be able to recover!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key clue is in the hands of a person who wants to remove him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hateful!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, one of his butlers Came in, "Your honor, I recently heard an interesting message -" <br <br /> & nbsp />; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
