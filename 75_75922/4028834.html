			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning flies into the castle office and delivers the view of the last snowy mountain Roland's hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Working hard," Roland touched the little girl's head. "Is there any new discovery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to snow or snow," she closed her eyes with pleasure. "Don't say the devil and the evil spirits, even the bigger animals can't see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What? It seems that I think more," Roland took out the previous drawings and looked through it from the beginning - although these overlooking drawings were only sketched, far from Soroya's " The photo is as delicate and real, but at least it can see the whole picture of the entire snowy mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its mountain is very large, about 4,000 meters high, standing on the top of the mountain can clearly see the sea of ​​clouds. The peak was not as sharp and sharp as he expected, but a very flat flat, slightly concave in the middle, like a huge crater. Only the sag is filled with frozen ice lakes, and the entire lake is like a clean mirror. According to lightning, through the thick layers of ice, she can see the flowing water underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think of the mountain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remains, Blackrock Tower, Town... "Nothing strange," Roland laughed. "Bare is surprising." He pointed to the newly drawn drawings. "Is the source of Chishui River coming from here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well," Lightning glanced at the head. "It’s in the clouds. If I don’t hear the sound of the water, I won’t notice it. There are many cracks on the mountain, and some of them are amazing. The light is two or three hundred meters wide, and the sound of falling water when it is close can be compared with thunder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't try to get in?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To tell the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a trial, but it didn't work," the little girl whispered. "The gap is big enough, and the height can even accommodate half of the castle, but the water from the rapids is too dense. Can't see anything, And it was also mixed with strong winds, and I was quickly pushed out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will not be allowed to do such a dangerous thing in the future," Roland said. " Remember when you promised me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any adventure must apply to you," Lightning pulled down his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this exercise will be punishable. Go to McDonald's to play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"诶...What about the snowy mountain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Temporarily come to an end," he folded all the bird's-eye view and put it in the drawer, "Deeply explore When Sylvie came back, I had to focus on the war with the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Lightning nodded, from The window flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Roland looked behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am here, kneel," the nightingale appeared from the desk and sat cross-legged. "The snow-capped mountains are cold, no one." Would you choose to establish a camp in that kind of ghost place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he took off his shoes, he couldn’t help but look at the pair of white cotton The ankle wrapped in the sock, "cough...so you also think that the giant beast is hidden inside the snowy mountains?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just think if they are so good If you have a long hole, it is not difficult to build a nest in the mountain, and..." The nightingale is hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The holes in the desperate mountains will not be They are related?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
