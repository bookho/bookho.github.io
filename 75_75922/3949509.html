			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha woke up again, the room was empty, the thick curtains were closed, and it looked extra quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably considering that he is not familiar with the environment, the candle is always lit by the bedside, and the orange flame is burning quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at it for a long time and found that no wax was flowing out, the candle was always so long, just like it could never burn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be caused by magic, she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quilt on the body is very soft, probably woven with a good cotton cloth, filled with a light and warm fluffy core. This kind of treatment is no worse than when you were in the holy city of Taqila. It is hard to believe that there are such comfortable beds and bedrooms in the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his fingers moving, his physical strength has recovered. Ai Gesha turned to get out of bed, driving the magic, and the cold suddenly overflowed from her fingers. It seems that the prince really did not do any hands and feet, but removed the stone of punishment and gave herself a certain degree of freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went to the window and unveiled the corner of the curtain. It was dark outside, I couldn't see the stars, and I couldn't see the moon. The whole earth seemed to be swallowed up by the darkness, leaving only a few miles of fire in the distance. Through the window, she could hear the sound of the wind whizzing outside, and occasionally she could see some snow falling on the glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it is winter, and it is also a good season for witches to wake up. In Takira, there is no such night at all, and every day in winter is a day of celebration in the city. The bonfire that burned through the night and disappeared from the tower, as if the entire city was lit. The flash of fire is like a star, symbolizing hope and the future. People pray around the campfire, eager to gather magic, across the realm of mortals. Whenever a witch appears, the fate of her family will change, and there will be no worries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha pulled up the latch and pushed open the window. The cold wind suddenly merged into the room and the curtains were blown backwards. The candles in the house are also extinguished. The darkness suddenly came in and filled every corner of the room. When the eyes adjust to the darkness, she can see the faint white light reflected from the snow on the roof of the town. From the perspective of the scope of the building, this place is indeed not big, and it coincides with the "Bianyu Town" in the mouth of the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such cold weather, ordinary people will be frozen when they stay outside for a few hours, but Ai Gesha is not afraid of the cold, making her feel a little uncomfortable. The chill will be automatically omitted by the body. When she felt cold, she still had almost forgotten before she was awakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close your eyes, and Ai Gesha’s mind is all the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federation is dead, the witch becomes the devil's minion, and the mortal is relying on the stone of the gods to hunter the witch... from the notes, Both Akaris and Nataya have successfully escaped from the fertile plains. If they can't stop it, the defeat of the federation is a foregone conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened at the time, so that both of them were defeated by the hands of mortals? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is simply not willing to continue thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you not cold?" Suddenly someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha was shocked, she turned her head and saw that in a dim light, a woman sat by the bed, her face completely hidden in the night In the middle, it is like a ghost that quietly emerges. At this point the door was still closed, and I had not heard any footsteps before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can close the window, I don't mind re-squeezing the candle," she added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is undoubtedly a witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So late, what is she doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha nodded quietly, closed the window, and quietly let the thin ice to cover his skin a little. The person did not make a dangerous move, but opened the first compartment of the bedside table, took out the fire from it, lit the candle - as the fire lit up, she saw the other side's appearance: a beautiful blond curly hair, long eyebrows, eyes look Very sharp, not a witch who I have seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It means... she was hidden in the crowd before? “Is this your ability?” Aegusa frowned. “Are you also a high-level awakened person?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even a respectable high-order Witches, it’s also a very rude thing to sneak in without swearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, you said evolution..." The nightingale shook his head. "I am not as smart as Anna, and I can finish the basics of nature in a short time." ", seeing the formula theorem, my head will be blown up. Evolution has probably missed me in this life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are half words in the short answer I don't understand, Ai Gesha stunned. She didn't expect that the "original witch" would say such a thing, and looking at her expression is not like deliberately teasing herself. Is this what the prince said... knowledge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That nature... foundation, can you show me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course Yes, as long as you are willing to join the Witch Alliance, play for the prince." She shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you work for a mortal?" Ai Gesha widened her eyes and whispered after a long time. "I thought I was weird enough, I didn't expect You are more crazy than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weird? Crazy?" Night screaming, "Why do you say this?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the holy city of Taqila, most of the awakened people only regard the ordinary people who can't gather magic as a low-ranking servant, inferior, or ... fertility tool." She slowly Said, "But I don't think so. They are stupid, but they are not hopeless. Just teach them to study and think. These people do not do much worse than witches in most things. Because of this, many people think that I The strangeness of life, actually handed over some of the affairs of the tower to the mortal. I did not expect you to go further than me, even recognize a mortal as the main, for their effectiveness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Lord Roland did not regard us as a servant," said the night. "I don't know what you have for the word effectiveness." A strange understanding, but the fact is that he has taken over the witches who have been oppressed by the church, giving the sisters new power, and letting everyone and the people living together in the land of the West, all together with the church, the evil beast, In the future, we will fight against the devil together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This model proved to be a failure!" Aegusa could not help but increase the volume, "in four More than a hundred years ago... For you, it was ** eight hundred years ago, the era of mortal and witches. At that time, human beings were almost all over the entire territory. However, in the face of the attack of the devil, the result was defeated. "There is only such a corner of the fertile plains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢?" She raised her eyebrows, "Is there still such a thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that this buried history has passed for more than four hundred and fifty years," Aegusa continued. "According to the records of the Federation, the third time The battle will begin soon, and you know nothing about the devil! The east of the wild is the whirlpool, you can still Where to retreat? Only by reorganizing the federation, uniting the witches, and increasing the chances of a higher level of awakening according to those knowledge, will it be possible to seize the last chance to block the devil's attack!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you have to say this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been more than four hundred years now? Four hundred years can change a lot of things, why are you still holding on to the previous concept and not letting go? "Night sighed," you heard the words when your Highness left, and mortals can defeat the devil. He is also doing things to unite everyone, but it is not just a witch. He wants to unite every ordinary person on the mainland. He told me that the people all over the mainland are the most powerful group. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abandonment--" Ai Gesha just wanted to refute this nonsense and suddenly stopped. The other person said so positively, as if he had seen it. The result is average. Four hundred years can really change this? Is it... the gray-haired prince has such incredible power that mortals can also have the power of a beautiful witch?<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to have realized it," said the nightingale, "The time is still very long. Why don't you put down your heart and confirm with your own eyes?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Ai Gesha’s silence is very long. "...I can see that you don't like me." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
