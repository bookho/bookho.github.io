			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From conquering the long-song fortress to the present half-month, the population and supplies brought by the fortress and the five people in the West are all in place. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion of the establishment of the Ministry of Agriculture, the spring ploughing of the new year has finally begun, which is the first step for Roland to explore the farming techniques. The serfs saw the dawn of being promoted to the free people, and they all worked very well. The need to supervise the workmanship and urge the serfs to work in the south bank of the Chishui River is basically extinct. Individual serfs find that even if they are lazy, no one will control themselves - according to those town halls that use strange tools to measure in the fields. Officials say that the lord does not care about the harvest of one or two fields. The serfs are cultivating themselves for themselves and many more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of the officials of the Ministry of Agriculture is so good that they have fully realized the principle of distribution according to work, but Roland has asked them to repeat these contents to the serfs. In order to strengthen the infusion effect and satisfy the prince's own feelings, the bank of Chishui River is filled with red flags, and the banner is drawn, which says "labor is the only way to get rich", "labor is glorious", "labor moves toward freedom, labor changes fate" And so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these measures are not uncontested by no one, for example, Barov was the first to stand up against it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you have no meaning at all. The vast majority of the serfs are illiterate, and they don’t care what is written on the banners. These people are both ignorant and Ignorance, sometimes the whip doesn't work, not to mention some seemingly inexplicable words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland’s answer is simple, "The banners are not meant to be They looked at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you still doing these things?" The assistant's expression at the time seemed quite confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to shape a living example."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never thought that the serf was stupid and could not be transformed People who are not educated do not mean they have no thoughts. Those who are dull will be driven by ** and interests. This is the nature of mankind. The repeated indoctrination of the commissioner of the Ministry of Agriculture seems to have little effect, but it will leave an introduction in their hearts, just like a trickle, and will eventually Consolidate into one piece. When the first serfs were promoted to free people, when they exchanged harvest crops for money, bought the finest clothes, fine food, and even a solid and warm brick house, the slogan repeated over and over again would become a reality, deep. Deeply in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the banners on the shore, it is for the townspeople who have received universal education. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on your own hands to get rid of poverty, becoming a formal member of Bianbu Town, and even more than being an aboriginal self, this is the power of hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only when you compare, can you feel the gap, only the initiative to pursue, the individual's efficiency will be the highest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron head stands at the mouth of the mine, waiting for a new round of mining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the demon moon was burnt by the high temperature steam, he never dared to stand near this black machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there is also a kind-hearted angel-like Miss Nana in Bianbu Town. The iron head touched her well-prepared cheek and felt very emotional. Losing herself at the time also suspected that the other party was the devil's minion, it was simply awkward to her. After the end of the winter, he deliberately raised two salted fish and a wild boar leg and went to the Pine House to apologize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes him even more surprised is that although Tiguin is a Viscount, there is no habit of aristocrats who like to look at people with their noses, and they have accepted their own. apology. For the first time, the iron head felt that the original nobles were not all ruthless guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iron old," a miner with a ash residue ran out of the hole. "The rope is already fastened."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," he turned and shouted in the direction of the steam engine. "Everyone is away! Flac, lift up the green lever and press the red lever again! If you make a mistake, I put your head Unscrew it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, iron old, wrapped on me!" Flack yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
