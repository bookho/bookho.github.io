Sipping saliva, said in a relaxed tone, "The long song fortress is undoubtedly mine, even if I am not here. However, I do need a person or a family to host the fortress for me. So, you should not ask for a ransom. , but "agent fee." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proxy...Pyro is no stranger to this word. Some discerning businessmen will always stare at the land with a large output, but no time or Disregarding the nobility of the traders, selling goods for them. In order to obtain this right, they have to pay a sum in advance as a security deposit.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many gold dragons do you want? ? He took a deep breath and calmed himself down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a long-term process, so don't pay it once," Roland paused. "Every 30% of the monthly tax revenue, and a thousand worth of materials, the rest is yours. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not outrageous, Pei Luo thought, as long as he can completely occupy the long song fortress, such a price can even be said to be fair. The other party is not joking, He confirmed this, and His Royal Highness is really planning to do this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Pedro tells himself in his heart. He and the prince are not enemies, the Duke It has completely failed, and the children will be deprived of their inheritance rights. If the coalition forces of the six people cannot defeat the prince, who else can prevent him from actually possessing the western environment? The powerful forces are the basic rules for the continuation of the nobility. The prince's approval, the honeysuckle will become the largest aristocratic family in the Western Territory.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, why don't you stay here? This castle is much more than the town of Bianbu. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually want to ask, why don't I personally manage the fortress?" Roland looked at the slightly awkward Pei Luo. "There are many reasons. For example, the power here is too complicated. It takes a long time to straighten out the relationship with each other, not to mention profiting from it." To support a local aristocrat, I think he knows better than me to govern this place. This is a win-win deal. Other than that, there are many reasons why you can slowly think about it. "The prince is playing with a silver cup. "Right, if you choose to be an agent, you can't revenge me for the Duke?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, Your Highness!" "Although the last sentence was a bit awkward, Perrault immediately replied.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke is gone, the first thing that the five people think of is how to divide his territory. Revenge, who cares?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But also knows that these reasons that His Highness said are not the real reason. The power is too complicated to be straightened out? In the face of overwhelming power, he can completely defy the leading opposition forces, and at most one or two years, all nobles will forget the loser Ryan, as Ryan did in the past. But two years is definitely not enough. The town is building a large city like the Long Song Fortress.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Highness must have a deeper plan.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "So good, then the city..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to act for you, Your Highness! Pelos blurted out, but soon his look became hesitant again. "But the king - no, I mean your brother, I don't necessarily agree with this result." If he assigned the West to the new Duke, I could not fight against the king. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't need to fight," Roland threw two letters in front of him. "Look at this, and I found it in the study of the Duke of Lane." Instruments. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyro quickly swept the contents of the letter and couldn't help but breathe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Looks like a secret letter, the new king Tiffco fought in the Eagle City with the Red Sea Queen, and suffered a major failure? The second content is even more shocking, the instrument is only half written, but the Duke of Ryan wants to annex the North The idea that independence is king has been revealed on paper. Since there is no end, it is not known who this paper instrument wants to send to.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately understands The meaning of His Royal Highness Prince - no need to resist, because the new king has been self-sufficient. Otherwise, the Duke will never want to raise the flag, his elite knight is enough to cover the West, but the Knights of the Kings are still poor. Many.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
