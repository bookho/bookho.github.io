			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kajin. Fez is still the person Mei is familiar with, at least in drama, he has a very pure belief. It is because of this conviction that she will not disguise her disappointment, nor will she change her rhetoric because she needs her help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space for his troupe to exchange for a perfect performance seems to be a natural choice for those who really love the drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she found that she couldn’t easily say that it was a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems as if something has stopped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei closed his eyes and faintly heard the girl’s voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Lannis, please wait for me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my thanks Gift, please be sure to accept..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards someone handed a salted fish to her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, Mey suddenly understood what was stopping her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her eyes and met the masters of the drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, she no longer has the slightest evasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to get rid of the answer, there are many kinds of rhetoric, first affirm your own appreciation, then pick up "but" as a turning point, then explain the shadow The nature of the show, or telling the drama that the drama was decided by the King, is a kind of answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kajin. Fiss knows very little about the Winter City. He doesn’t know the special features of the Star Flower Troupe, nor does he understand the importance of the drama. It can be said that I have found the wrong direction from the beginning. If she can explain it clearly, she can not only reverse the misunderstanding of these people, but even have the opportunity to save the disappointment of Master Ka Jin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mei’s heart knows that these are just another escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Kajin, is your performance just for the sake of your knees?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There are also nobles, ministers and lords who come to congratulate," Kajin nodded. "If there is no matching audience, even if the performance is wonderful, it makes no sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Just like gold with jewellery, good wine with jade cup, the actor’s smile, every move, has its own meaning, only the careful and dedicated appreciator can taste the difference between excellence and extreme The difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So please forgive me, I can't promise you," Mey said, "because you played, it's not a perfect drama."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The old man frowned. "You haven’t even seen it before, how did you make this determination?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because even if it is more exciting, those people just appreciate it on the side--" She feels that there is strength in her heart, "They will applaud, praise, and be free." It’s just about it, but that’s it. This drama is just a small part of their many entertainments. Without it, there will be no change in their lives – if it’s just a dispensable thing. How can we call it perfect?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Kajin. Fiss sinks down. For the creator, the drama is equivalent to his own child. No one can easily accept this kind of evaluation. "I thought that you just lost your way to chase your fame. I didn't expect to learn the arrogance of the world. Listen. What do you say, what kind of perfect drama did you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not seen it," Mey said calmly, "but I know What it should be like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kajin stared at her, her eyes were like a sharp edge, and years of accumulation made him have a mountain-like oppression. The weight is heavy enough to make the younger generation of the drama industry chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ke Mayi did not give in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also knows that after the next words, she will go on another path - a road they have never seen or understood. This means that she will part ways with the majority of the theatre world, and then she will not be disappointed. I am afraid that all past sentiments will end and she will not be able to integrate into them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price is great, isn't it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other voice answered her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it deserves us to do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei opened his mouth, "Excellent The drama should not be just an observation, an entertainment that enters their vision only when the nobility is idle; it can carry more things and even change the fate of others—"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Witch Diary" gives people a chance to learn about the witch's life, thus removing the stigma that is not theirs; "Dawn" encourages everyone to participate in labor, bid farewell to poverty and hunger, Thanks to this call, many people have lived a life of good food and clothing; "New City" in an intuitive way, allowing new immigrants to accept the rules of no winter city, but also the black street mouse that has flown here has no place. "The Life of a Hero"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused and said slowly, "Reviving a sad little girl and plunging into new In life - I think that people like her who lost their loved ones in the war are not a minority, no matter how many people Change, I am very excited to play to help them "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;". What do you want to say in the end ...... "Cajun Chen Sheng Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You told me that the most outstanding drama is to immerse the audience in the character's life, but now I want them to see their own future. "Mei bluntly said, "Without the jewels and jade cups, the nobility can find other alternatives, and the drama I play is a food that can fill most people's stomachs."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faced with this answer, Kajin did not answer the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that the drama you have prepared for two years must be very exciting, but the upcoming performance of "Star Wolf" by Star Flower Troupe is also beyond imagination. It took only over a month to go to the stage, and even some of the actors were still performing for the first time, but it was still the best drama I have ever seen." She bowed her knees, "If you watched it, the idea If there is no change, I will recommend your new drama to your majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Whistle Inn, Mey only felt comfortable and even footed. It’s a lot lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just out of the alley, she saw Carter Lannes waiting on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you?" Mayi surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Irene said that you were taken over by Mr. Ka Jin’s management, I was a little worried, so I came over." Carter shrugged, "I will wait anyway." I have to go to the convenience market to buy some food for dinner, and it just happens to be on the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Mey gave him a look. "Do you know long ago?" What happened in the hotel that day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't eat a bowl of rice that day, it's strange to see it." The chief knight is proud. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait..." She slammed down. "Isn't it going to talk to the City Hall? Refused to apply for the performance of the Kajin Theatre Company." Class--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" Carter raised his eyebrows. "What are you talking about? Whose show is I rejecting?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei stared at him for a while, and he sighed. "No, nothing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Don't you tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter anyway..." She laughed. "Right, haven't you bought a dinner yet?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
