			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella bluntly said, "Frank us the purpose of Roland Wimbledon and tell him the church... No, the truth of the Witch Federation, and four More than a hundred years of the battle of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the cleansing became the pope, the library became the purest of all the sects The place of war of gods is no longer a secret to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he doesn't believe it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will believe, just take him there When you walk around the illusion of the reflection church, you know everything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He may also regard this as a witch's trick." Not too slow to say, "Reversely, assuming Roland knows the truth of the Federation, will he put his lifelong experience against the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Isabella could not help but hold her, she opened her mouth, but could not say a word of assurance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We all know what the nobility looks like, and they are most interested in territorial, wealth, and enjoyment. Perhaps when the red moon comes, the devil will be organized, he will organize The people resist, but once the situation is in trouble, are you sure that the prince will stick to the end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo took her hand and came to the round table "He is just a mortal, Isabella. Vulnerable, powerless, short-lived, the will will fade with age, a simple cold can kill his life. Even Roland accepted the union The mission of the meeting, determined to fight the devil in the end, his subjects, heirs will also be willing to give up all enjoyment, use all the resources in the territory for this brutal war that can not see the margins? Only the church can borrow the gods Faith does this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least... we should send messengers to talk to him first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no way to solve these problems," Jie Luo shook his head. The secular world will make the church's faith collapse, the holy city collapses, and in order to stabilize the witch organization, Roland will not let us and the gods punished. By me to devour his words, the holy city also has to pay a heavy price, two From the results, there is not much difference. In this case, why do you want to pin your hopes on a mortal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabella hesitates stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that Jielu is right, although it will only hurt both players, but no one knows that after the church surrenders, he will not be the witches for his men. Revenge on the church. As a result, the loss will be unavoidable, and things seem to have returned to a far point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The knowledge of those weapons is not exclusive to mortals, but mortals can't get the body of a witch." Jie Luo went on to say, "Through the battle of the soul, I can get a person's inheritance, even life, no matter how long the war of gods lasts, I will not grow old, and I will not lose my way, let alone the stupid descendants will destroy the results." She paused. "In the two hundred years, I have seen too many talents have been exhausted by the years, no matter how brave and intelligent they are when they are young, they will eventually become a dust in the hustle and bustle. This is the light. One point, I am far better than him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most critical The point is that I am the darling of God, Isabella.” Jielu emphasized with an unquestionable voice, “No matter who the opponent is, I have never failed, and thousands of souls that have been swallowed can testify!” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabella sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do? If you don't get enough distance, I can't eliminate the effect of the stone of punishment."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo chuckled, "Don't forget the high-level prints left by the federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one can use "God"..." Isabella frowned. "And "infinity" is one-off. Are you sure you want to spend it in this place? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it can serve to reverse the battle. "Jie Luo did not hesitate, "Whether it is to deal with ordinary people or against the devil, as long as it can be fixed, it is not a plain fee. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
