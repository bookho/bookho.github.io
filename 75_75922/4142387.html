In the memory of the devil, he has seen how these aliens have been promoted - by blending with more powerful magic stones to define their talents or talents, to become a life, not to die. In essence, there is not much difference between the ability of the witch and the witch. It is resigned and even more cruel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the technology is different... As long as you master the rules, you can quickly expand the scale and develop according to your needs, which is not a good for humans. Sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you be sure?" As the closest person to Roland, Anna apparently realized this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a need to do further research on the wills returned, but..." She looked at Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter clicked on the Lord and brought everyone to a black boulder covered with cracks. "This is part of the giant skeleton, and the current rough anatomical results come. Look, it is very likely to be a living thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...the living thing is not strange," Roland touched his chin, after all, in the post-war report. Some officers mentioned that when the enemy's giant skeleton was hit by a cannonball, it made a roar of resounding battlefields. "This thing is equivalent to the deformed devil's armor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, sire," Celine's tone was a bit odd. "I mean... this The stone is alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slight glimpse, and then the same Take a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, do you mean that it has life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a stone? Devil?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t quite understand. Can you explain more in detail?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; For a time, the inquiry sounded in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a nutshell, it has a separate system that can perform simple actions autonomously." Serine rolls up a hammer and aligns the stone The fracture slammed down, and with the "when" sound, the stone shook slightly. Through the gap, Roland can see that there is something faint in the interior similar to the meridians, and this kind of tremor lasted for half a minute before it stopped, apparently not because of the hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be seen from the scene that a huge skeleton is hanging from the lower abdomen of the giant skeleton. We have always thought that it is deformed. The body of the demon. The anatomical results prove that the two are not one thing.” Ai Gesha took the road. “After discovering this, I and Celine could not understand it. Since the skeleton itself can move, it’s abdomen. Why did the deformed demon exist? Until I saw the demons transforming my hands, I suddenly realized that this is really like a kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna One reaction, "carrier?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Celine applauded. "Whether it is the original carrier or the worm, they all have a distinct The characteristic, that is, when there is no controller, they are still living things." She turned and looked at Roland. "Your Majesty, do you remember the words that Cabradaby said?" When it comes to a piece of heritage, civilization has been upgraded?'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& "There is one more sentence," Roland nodded. The first time he heard the word upgrade, he almost didn't say "I am Tatalin", so the impression is particularly profound. "The weapons are also based on the debris. What did the content create?... probably this means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly said thoughtfully, "Now it seems that Cabradabi will Think so, because they have had similar experience, from the debris to get the carrier manufacturing method? That is, whether the spider magic or the giant skeleton, in fact, is a combination of two devils, one for the carrier, one for the manipulation "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a great possibility, after all, there are too many similarities between the two, such as the carrier's vitality is extraordinary, and it can survive very long under dormancy. Time; even if it is hit hard, it is not so easy to die, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
