			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two days of sailing, a village and farmland appeared on the uninhabited green field, and the walls of Chishui City appeared in front of the advance army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the largest city on the Chishui River, it has the population and resources that can rival the old kingdom. If it is not the silver mine, the minerals add too much, and the temperature is uncertain. The ancestors of Budun will set the king in Chishui instead of the current Shuguang City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian raised the lookout and observed for a while, "What are you going to do when you get to the dock? First use a naval gun to shock them?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That may arouse the hostility of the other lord, our primary goal is to church, others can be put aside," the iron axe shook his head. "According to your diplomatic process, first submit The instrument."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleet immediately stopped the turmoil after docking at the outskirts of the dock. As the soldiers gathered outside the dock, the gate quickly closed, even the moat The suspension bridges were pulled up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending a document, Brian sent a reply and received a reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other party said that the lord of the lord welcomes the arrival of his army, but he needs to send the messenger to the city to explain the situation. After he understands the cause of the incident, he will open the gate. Let us enter the city." Soldiers reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the situation? Isn’t the paper already made clear?" Brian was displeased. "We only aim at the church. He can’t help but think." Let the group of gods escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also your rule?" The iron axe turned his head and looked at the accompanying staff members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh...the aristocratic words, it should be," Pedro’s chieftain, Traf, replied. "After all, Roland is not in person, Chishui City is not him." In the jurisdiction area, it is normal for the other party to have a doubtful attitude. As long as the identity-generating messenger is sent, it is fine to explain it in detail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Identity? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The big family that allows the lord to win the trust," Traf explained. "For example, honeysuckle in the West."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp The two sides of the Iron Axe, Brian and Fanner face each other. Before they became the commanders of the First Army, one was a Saudi citizen. The latter two were civilians. They were not only ignorant of the nobility, nor did they have the ability to The identity of the city owner's peer-to-peer conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to say that it is better to use the shell to open the gate directly." Brian was annoyed. "As long as you get two shots, they will know what." It’s the right thing to do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let me come,” said Itis, “The Kant family is a family in the North, and my father is also the Duke. "It’s not a problem to be a messenger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What if this is a scam?" Fanna hesitated, "For example, the lord of Chishui City has long colluded with the church. Together, when you go in, you will grab you and then force us to retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That would not be good for him, and you will not do it, not "Itis smiled. "But the nobles with normal heads will not think about the idea of ​​the messenger. It will only attract the resentment of other nobles, and it will not affect the overall situation. If he really colludes with the church, he should Directly closed the city, and in fact, their city has not set up bonfires and hot oil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will accompany her," Sir Sir Stilt said. "At least I was a knight who can take care of her if she is in danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I am very grateful for your concern, Beidi Pearl does not require anyone to take care of it," said Itis confidently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take a team of soldiers," Iron Axe finally made the decision. "Once we hear the gunshots, we will launch a storm."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half an hour, the gate was slowly opened and the suspension bridge was released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people stunned to see Miss Itis’s escort from the First Army squad and a silver armor, the same chubby middle-aged man came out . Although the man is gorgeous in dress, his manners and manners seem to be quite pleasing to her. At first glance, it seems to be a servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
