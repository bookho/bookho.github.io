			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After visiting the steam engine on site, Roland and Margaret returned to the castle office and continued to discuss the details of the business contract. If such negotiations involve bargaining, it is common for both parties to compete for a day or two. Therefore, the finance minister is usually responsible for the work, and the lord can only use the amount and the bottom line. However, the other party has already finalized the price, and Roland has saved a lot of effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I expect that the next arrival will be one month later, when there will be three ships full of saltpeter dhows arriving with me." Business woman in parchment On the fly, he wrote, "According to 90% of the market price, it is about 315 gold dragons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The town can almost produce Two steam engines," Roland deliberately lowered the quantity, "that is, a thousand gold dragons, you can use the Golden Dragon to make up the difference, or you can use other goods instead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What kind of goods do you need?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Iron, copper, lead, green 矾,” he said, “all are common minerals. But the top three I don't need minerals, but smelted metal ingots. In addition, I need ten sets of crystal glassware. As for whether there are carvings, kettles or wine glasses, it doesn't matter, but it must be the highest quality produced by Wangdu Alchemy Workshop. Product. If the price exceeds the difference, I can make up or get two steam engines from the next month. Deducted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are treating me as your exclusive dealer," Margaret chuckled. "I didn't manage the mine, though. I know a few of my peers who specialize in ore trade. It’s just that I never expected that a remote borderland could have such a huge business opportunity. No aristocrats live here, but they consume a lot of saltpeter; For the town built for the North Slope Mine, it is necessary to purchase minerals outside. This is simply not in line with my business knowledge, your Highness, your territory is incredible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A major feature of industrial production is that a large amount of raw materials are swallowed and the finished product is exported. Roland opened his hand. "The town will have more to do in the future. I think we can achieve long-term" -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Margaret suddenly His eyes widened and he looked at Roland with a look of surprise. The latter snorted and turned his head. He saw the drenched lightning bolting in front of the floor-to-ceiling window, his hands covering the glass, his face panicking - she His face was pale, his hair was affixed to his forehead, and the drops of water dribbled down the hair, as if he had just fished out of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland quickly got up and opened the window. After lightning flew into the room, he flew into Roland's arms. The panicked look relaxed and his body softened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Night, call Nana Va," he said anxiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." A voice came from the empty side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going on here, she should not encounter evil beasts or devils in the air, does the other party have the ability to fly? Roland roughly examined the body of the lightning and found that there was no obvious trauma, and he was relieved a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, she... is the lightning you said?" Margaret pouted, slowly approaching the prince, and carefully looked at the little girl in his arms. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned, damn, how to forget her. He shouted out the door: "Shawn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards walked into the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Ms. Margaret, can only ask you to stay here for a while," the prince stood up with lightning and said, "Take this Wangdu merchants took it to the room on the first floor and watched it. Without my order, she should not let her out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? No, Your Highness...please wait," she suddenly realized. "I am not malicious to the witch, let alone she is the daughter of Thunder, I will not go to the church." —”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m just in case,” Roland interrupted. “I will come to you later to verify.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
