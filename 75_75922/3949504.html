			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, the wall has been broken, the coalition may not last long! Let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She could already hear the killing sound outside, and walked out of the tower, only to see the dark clouds in the sky revealing dim red light, like wrapped in thick blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But my sister has not returned yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a Guardian soldier, It’s impossible to leave the line of defense without authorization,” Kraft’s voice became more and more anxious. “If you die here, don’t let her down!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hesitate Half-sounding, she finally nodded and agreed. "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets are full of fugitives, and the guards maintain a precarious order and join the crowd. She couldn't help but follow everyone to the south gate. Kraft kept closely with her and used her strong and burly body to protect her from being flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s completely defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our ending? She looked at the Tongtian Tower behind her eyes, which was the highest point of the city and the hub of the Federation. The flying devil has been carrying the mad magic into the top of the tower, and occasionally a lightning bolt will light up and knock down the devil. But everything doesn't help - there are so many enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hundreds of years of construction and development, the city has become the most prosperous holy city in the fertile plains. However, today, it seems to be destroyed. The efforts of several generations will not save the tower. Just like the sand castles that children spend in the afternoon, they only need to be confused and disordered in the blink of an eye. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the South Gate, the devil who has been intercepted has arrived, and The combatants spontaneously stepped forward and fought with the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the other party not only has madness, but also the fear of the devil and the hell lord, the strength difference between the two sides is too great. After a wave of spears, dozens of people were lying in a pool of blood, some were pierced by iron spears, and the hottest intestines slipped into the cold snow. Some just cut off their hands and feet and held wounds. Mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, what are you doing?" Kavra lived with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can fight too," she took a deep breath, "Let me go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you are much more important than them, you can't-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Relax!" Her magic is pouring out, chilling, Shake the other's palms and then step forward without heading back. Seeing the enemy, but a hundred feet away from the face and the bloody weapon, she felt her heart is gradually tightening. But even so, she is not willing to continue hiding behind the crowd - as a member of the holy city witch, even if it is finally dead, it should die on the battlefield! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are allowed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the side of the battlefield is clear The swearing, one person falls from the sky, just like the gods are coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is facing all the people and holding up the sword in her hand. The reddish-brown hair is like a flame, and it instantly ignites the hope of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Warrior of the Federation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is...superior! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the voice of people's surprises, the radiance began to flow between the blades, and soon the sword was turned into a dazzling golden color - like a new one. Like the sun, the brilliance of the earth fills the earth, and even the dark red clouds in the sky dare not cover its edge. There are countless golden tassels under the clouds. When the light rises to the apex, the comer jumps forward and slashes the sword against the attacking devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, time seemed to stagnate, and before the incandescence of engulfing everything, the other person’s figure was like the last darkness at dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she opened her eyes again, the snow in front of her eyes had turned into a scorched earth, and the approaching enemy seemed to have never existed before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other devils see this scene, retreating in unison, more sacred warriors also arrived at this time, joined the battlefield to chase the enemies of the escape, surrounded Was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are going quickly." The witch holding the sword seemed to exhaust all her strength. She squatted on the ground with one knee and gasped. "Look at it now, and quickly leave here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But... adults, where can we go?" someone in the crowd asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, where can we go? She thought bitterly, even the last holy city fell under the devil's attack, tens of thousands of people were killed, all means were exhausted, and they failed to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't give up, we still have hope!" said the red-haired witch firmly. "Turn over the mountains, cross the river, and go to the wild land." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But... there are only a few backward villagers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can Cast the order, go, as long as you can survive, you will definitely see the day of victory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, why don't you go with them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the group out of the crowd and hurried west. Except for Kraft and the family guards, the rest of the people have basically no fighting power and are the servants and servants of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have left some key magic stones and documents in the test building of the fascinating forest. Since it is necessary to recast the order, these things are crucial for the witch. I want to take them to the mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil is catching up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Muscle stone, you go to block them," Kraft ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gritted her teeth and bowed her head. These mortals can only stop the pace of the devil, and can't beat the opponent at all. I am afraid that there will be no more life. But she must leave them and go to the destination as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown, there are black and white staggered spots in the sky... the line of sight becomes blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kraft is breathlessly behind him, even if he is as strong as him, after After three days of snow, I was already very tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at her eyes, the team of more than 30 people, until now only six people. Some people have escaped halfway, and some people have taken the initiative to leave the team. If the devil catches up again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, master, and me?" Kraft seemed to see through her thoughts and comforted. "I will try my best to drag them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is slightly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you want to stick to the end? If you run away now, you might still be able to survive," she said. "We are witches, they are always high. And you are just an ordinary person. Under normal circumstances, you will not think about going to die with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have never been harsh on us, Although I don't have magic power, I understand a lot of truths - it is my duty to guard you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a commotion behind, everyone understands, the last moment Already arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, go, don't look back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black and white spots are getting more and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
