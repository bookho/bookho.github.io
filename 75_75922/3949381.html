			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fjord, Hailong Bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The believers of the church boarded the wall and fired arrows at the witches, but they had little effect on the invisible barrier of the Sawyer and the magical servant of Molier. The arrow either falls out of thin air or is swallowed by the servant. Only when the opponent shoots a broken magic arrow embedded with a stone of God's punishment will it be a threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of stone of God's punishment is limited. Unfortunately, the witch who was shot will be immediately dragged to the rear for treatment. As long as the blood is stopped in time, it will not Will endanger life. After two or three rounds of shooting, more than 20 witches have advanced to the wall. The ashes jumped directly to the top of the wall and cleaned up those who dared to show up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few days of pre-war investigations, they knew the weaknesses of this wall. There were different lengths of pigeons in the sky - it was Mai Mai who was telling everyone that they had arrived in the right place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a few previous combat experiences, Lotus did not hesitate to display his ability. The ground suddenly vibrated and the church believers wanted to rush and stop, and they were all smashed. kill. The wall without the stone of the gods was quickly collapsed, and the witches swarmed in, and they made their ability to attack the believers. The moment when they did not wear the stone of God's punishment, they fell down mostly, while the ones still standing were clean and neat. Harvesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time since the church was built that it was a frontal attack, and the other party is still a deadly enemy of the church. The priests stationed there also know that at the last moment, he called for the rest. The believer took the pill and dedicated himself to the gods. More than a dozen mad believers entangled the ashes with flesh and blood, and the rest of them rushed toward the lotus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lotus that has been prepared has raised a wall from the ground to temporarily block the enemy. The stone of punishment does not eliminate the magic effect that has been completed. When I bypassed the earth wall, I found that the wall was empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogant believers had to return to besiege the ashes, but the witches would suddenly appear behind their backs, knocking down the unpredictable enemies, and each time they would make their opponents Suffering from the loss, after half a hour of fierce battle, the church was covered with the body of the believer, and only one priest was left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shuddered and put the pill on his mouth, and he could swallow it in the future, and he was cut off by the ashes that came up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You damn evil man! The monster cursed by the devil!" He held his hand and snarled hysterically, his eyes full of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Afraid? When you tortured and slaughtered those innocent people, did you think about their feelings?" Ash said coldly, "You are more than a witch." Like the devil's minions, there is no evil scum. So, let's go to hell and report it." After that, the great sword fell and broke his curse in his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have we won?" Morrier walked up to her, still a little unbelievable in her tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," the ashes breathed a sigh of relief. "This is the last church in the fjord. Since then, there have been no church strongholds on the islands. It’s that we won!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the church’s power in the fjord is very weak, there are more than a hundred believers in each church, and there is no Judge, but this It was the first time that the witches faced the victory of the church. From being chased by the other side, I was stunned by the sound of a little wind. Now that I have captured the church, I have knocked down the behemoths of the past, even if it is a negligible part of the church, it is enough to make the witches feel excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she expected, after confirming this long-awaited victory, I couldn’t help but cheer up. The church is like a mountain that is in the hearts of everyone. Now, they finally shake the foot of the mountain and let a glimmer of light come in. From then on, the fjord will become their real home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We won!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the Tilly!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕咕!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning to the island by boat, the ash couldn't wait to get back to Tilly's residence and tell her the news that the witch had won. The latter slid the gray hair to the ear, revealing a bright smile: "Mc. has told me, I heard that you are all safe, this is really good."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
