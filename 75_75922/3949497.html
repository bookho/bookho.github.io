			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tilly, you can't--" Ashes just wanted to stop, and she was interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you want to enter the hole, you must rely on the flying witch to bring people out," Tilly shook the ring on her finger, "although carrying After the heavy object, the magic consumption will increase greatly, but at least I can bring an extra witch, which is very important for the action - with a witch, we can cope with more situations." She paused, hope To the witch in the border town, "Anna, lightning, wheat, I need your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no disagreement, the little girl is still showing a eagerness expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly was relieved a little. "Then go to the bottom of the hole and add the ashes, Sawyer, Sylvie, the rest of the sisters, the ground hole." "Come on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tilly, let me be with you," Andrea said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you encounter a group of evil beasts, I am afraid that I will not be able to come up with a nightingale," she shook her head. "You are close to her, just to each other." Cooperate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, I will hold the exit for you," the nightingale seemed full of confidence. "No matter whether it is the devil or the evil beast, you can't get close to it." One step.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly considered it very clearly, and it was up to several witches to depend on the carrying ability of the flying witch. The first and most important thing is the "ice". If it can't be awakened on the spot, it must be shredded and taken away, at least equivalent to the weight of two or three witches. Only the invisible barrier of the Sawyer can hold such a heavy object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi’s magical eye is a must, without her, they can’t find the exact location of the ruins in the monster’s belly. Anna's cutting and heating ability is the same, but neither of them can fly, but it is lighter and can be carried by the wheat stalks into the magic bird. In the end, the supernatural ash who can stabilize the battle under any circumstances is carried by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning can fly, but according to her own statement, once the person is caught, the height will drop very much, I am afraid I can't fly this deep cave. Her strengths are excellent flexibility and speed, which can effectively serve as a warning, exploration and pinch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of these witches is almost irreplaceable, and one less person will make things very tricky, so it’s not impulsive to go on, but after considering it all The decision made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Andrea... Her destructive power is extremely amazing in close range, but her ability will be great once she encounters a narrow area where she can’t reach her fingers. Discount, it is better to stay on the ground with the night, beware of the evil beasts nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly did not consider giving up the rescue and went home. However, there is always a kind of uneasiness in her heart. Why is the surrounding area intact, but I have taken a look at the remains of this stone tower? Especially the direction in which the beast crawled - she looked to the mountains in the northwest, and after that was the place where the devil lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any connection between the two? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot air balloon quickly settled down under the control of Wendy and Anna. Tilly left the distracting thoughts in the brain and reviewed the plan again. Take a breath, say one word at a time, "We set off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pothole Deeper than she expected, the cave was about two stories high, starting straight down, and it didn't take long to start tilting, and finally formed a horizontal passage. The surrounding soil exudes an unpleasant smell. When you are close, you can also see the sticky liquid dripping from the dirt surface, just like the moist traces left by the creeps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the group continued to deepen, the light coming in from the hole disappeared quickly, and the entire hole was trapped except for the faint light of several torches. It was dark. Not only that, but the whistling wind also silenced, and the coldness was gradually replaced by geothermal heat. Tilly felt that the body was warming up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the flames of the near and far, she couldn’t help but think of the fireflies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The behemoth is in front," At this moment, Hilly whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
