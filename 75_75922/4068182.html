			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame erupted from the ground like a giant tree with claws and claws. The swaying flame tip is its branches, and the thick smoke forms the leaves, which are connected to each other and intertwined into a broad black crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking under the orange-red fire tree, Thuram felt that the temperature around him was rising, and the sweat on the forehead was on the forehead. Become slimy. This place and the icy desert outside are like two worlds. The cold wind of the evil moon cannot erode the core area of ​​the earth god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is why it is called the place of the fire..." The blond goddess curiously looked around. "I didn't expect the extreme south to be so interesting." Place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a week of getting along, Thuram had a preliminary understanding of the people who brought the iron axe. For example, the talking goddess Andrea is good at shooting, and its superb arrow method is even worse than the oldest hunter in the Shamin. Undoubtedly, she will join the mighty goddess Ashes to participate in the sacred duel that will begin next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it interesting?" The ashes pulled the mouth of the mouth. "I only think that it is like a steamer. If the average person stays for two days, I am afraid I will become a person." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not be surprised if you say such things," Andrea shrugged. "There is a lack of taste and style. Naturally, I can't appreciate the style." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you dry the sweat first and boast? You can't see what style is sweating."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram couldn’t help but have a glimpse of the blond goddess, asking the most beautiful of the whole extreme Where is the place, not the Yinchuan oasis that brings the place where the Mojin people live and reproduce, but the burning place and the endless cape where the fire never stops. Although they are full of dangers, they also symbolize the powerful power, the residence of the gods, and the belief of the sand people. One is used to compete for status and power, to show the clan the courage and tenacity; the other is to sacrifice, hope that the son of the sea can protect the people, inject more blood into Yinchuan, and make the desert grow a new oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in the burning place, the whole area is sunken downwards, and the middle is slightly raised, like an inverted buckle, which can hold several iron sand castles. The eternal fire caused the surrounding sand to harden and consolidate, and walking on it was like stepping into a stone-filled palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the wide and solid roads, there are black abyss and shafts on both sides. The fire is sprayed from the well and the earth is constantly baked. The most striking thing is the color – any sandman who is in the holy land for the first time will be attracted by the colorful colors here: from the abyss, the rock walls on both sides show a stepwise change. The reddish luster, the closer it is to the surface, the darker it is, like a piece of charcoal that is burnt red and bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, on the ground, the color suddenly turned into a greenish green, and the sand was covered with a layer of crystal clear jade. It is a glass-like object formed by the re-crystallization of the gravel after it has melted, and it reflects the brilliant brilliance against the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going up is the eternal theme of this place - the flame of orange red. There are dozens of fire pillars in the basin, which are clustered around the high platform in the central area, as if to meet the new challengers. It is also the core of the burning place, the test venue for the sacred duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red and green alternate, plus the black water of the ground and the golden sand dunes in the distance, it seems to focus all the colors in the desert to this piece. The area is coming. If it is not evil moon, you can also see the sun shining through the sky, and compared with such a strange scene, there is only the endless cape burning with flames on the bottom of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also think it's beautiful...if it's not killing and bleeding, it's better." His new owner, Princess Aosha, Zall, Silvermooner Suddenly, "As Roland said, just for appreciation, it will become famous..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"National Nature Park?" Another little girl, the female hummingbird, took the lead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, that's what he said when he looked at the Devil's Camp behind the Snow Mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
