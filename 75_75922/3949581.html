			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening, Roland held a grand banquet in the Lord's Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time the Witch Alliance initiated an attack on the church. In addition to the rescue of Speer Passy, ​​he also gave birth to a Hull. Metz priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the five witches who took part in the battle came on stage, there was a burst of applause in the hall, and he rarely drank two cups of Evelyn on weekdays. Iced fruit juice white wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was only a small victory, the long demon moon itself was nervous, and he hoped to take this opportunity to relax everyone’s mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the next day Roland walked into the office with a dizzy head, the nightingale had been sitting cross-legged on the table and waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have to take more breaks?" he asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since agreeing to the interception of the messenger group, he has never really let go of his heart - even if he knows that once he enters the open space, the fog ability will allow her to stand Invincible, but still worried about what kind of accidents, after all, this is not a daily practice, but a real life and death fight. Seeing her energetic now, his mood has been a lot of pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale swallowed the dried fish. "Of course not, I have returned to the best condition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Roland just sat back in the seat, she jumped off the table and hugged him around the back of the chair. "If I take a day off, I will see you less often."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince is slightly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I wanted to do this in the castle garden yesterday...but it’s not bad now," the nightingale whispered in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the footsteps outside the office, she pulled her hands away and sneaked in In the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness," the guard yelled, "The dragon collar lord, Marquis of Passy asks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Please come in." Roland cleared his throat and gestured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell Passy walked into the office and sat down at the table after the chest salute. "I have carefully considered the request you mentioned before." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" He poured a cup of tea at the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days when the nightingale, the ashes and other people fought the church, he did not idle, except for visiting the town with the female marquis, I have had many discussions. During the period, Roland described the crisis that the kingdom was about to face, the origin of the church, and the threat of the devil in a concise manner, and told her the next plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Speer heard the origins of the church and the reasons for hunting the witch, he was surprised that his eyes were coming out. If it weren't for Terry and Aisha to testify, she wouldn't believe that the witch had ruled the entire wilderness anyway, but since then, her attitude has changed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Recovering the power of separatism, implementing the same law and administrative system, the post may not be inherited, nor allowed to buy or sell... I am not unacceptable for these requirements, but..." She paused. "I am just curious. Do you really intend to promote them to all the territories?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, if you don't, gray The fort is just a shoal of sand.” Roland nodded. “Before the final enemy arrives, I must gather as much power as possible.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is equivalent to offending all the nobles," Speer said slowly. "Especially, the position cannot be inherited. If I am not mistaken, the lord who is in charge of the land is also a kind of position. So, you "rebel." The identity of the king is to be settled. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I never expected them to take the initiative to retreat," he tapped on the table, "before the battle of the goddess of destiny, the resistance of the nobility It is not something that needs to be considered. In addition, I am not trying to kill them. As long as these people can integrate into the new system, they can even retain their own territory. What they lose is only the right to separate them. I believe they will make wise choices. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
