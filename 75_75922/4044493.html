			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A whole day, Roland turned every channel on the TV. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are really a few programs that explain the fighting competition. Unlike the traditional fighting, the downfall of the fighting is almost half the size of the football field, and there is no referee. The battle between the contestants is much more intense. It is common practice to smash the floor. The sound of the punches on both sides is like a thunderous squeak, and it seems to be the same as adding special effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say competitive viewing, it’s really much more exciting than boxing or free fighting, just punching to the flesh, no rounds and halftime breaks. The audience was excited from the beginning to the end, not to mention that the two often vomited blood and bruises. Roland couldn't help but frown. As a martial artist, this kind of battle is too hard. They don't worry about winning the game after winning the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he cares most is those who have become martial artists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that their physical fitness is much higher than ordinary people, and the power of nature is not simply to enhance strength or speed, it seems that there are special usages. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The off-site commentary will mostly give these skills a special name, and also use it as the slogan of the martial arts. For example, this man named Hurricane, he can hit a super high-speed combo in an instant, so the nickname is a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, does this mean that you have your own battle card in front of your opponent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just fine, and even more so to Roland’s surprise, he actually saw the devil in the game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a typical madman, tall, burly, without masks and iron gloves, and the exposed fangs and three-finger features are clearly not human. The audience can turn a blind eye to this and listen to the tone of the commentary. It seems that they just regard each other as a foreign martial artist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally realized the strangeness and power of the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make the devils swallowed by Jielu reasonable, the dreams even turned them into a minority race cohabiting in this world. So what kind of mixed beast? In the mind of Roland, the image of the Yalong man maid, full of vitality, emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the belly screamed, he discovered that the sun was gradually slanting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally this time Jielu should have already returned. I remember that her school was on Zhongshan Road, about three kilometers away from the apartment building. The class time for the tutoring class is 5:30. It is now 6:1. Is there something happening in the school? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought for a moment and decided to go downstairs to buy something to fill his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, she may also be hanging out with her friends. In the summer, it will be completely dark until around 8:00, and use this time to go to the park or game hall. Playing is not a strange thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the landlord, not a babysitter. Even if you go to school at this time, you may not be able to meet her, or don't worry about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little girl, even if you are diligent, you will occasionally want to be lazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dinner was made by him... No, he came with a takeaway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the picture on the TV suddenly flashed, and the fighting game became a news broadcast room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A good night for the audience, now an urgent news is inserted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The host holds A stack of manuscripts, looked worriedly. "There was a knife robbery on Zhongshan Road. A twenty-nine bus was hijacked. The traffic police have blocked the intersection. Please ask the citizens nearby to go out temporarily. We will The first time the event has been reported."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, isn't this the way that Jie Luo goes to school often? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is so stunned, is she also hijacked? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is by no means a good news. As an important part of the dream world, he does not know the consequences of the death of a key person like Jieluo. It is also the reason why he does not want to go deep into the family of Jieluo--according to the experience of dreaming in the past, the brain subconscious will encounter problems when it encounters problems that cannot be compiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that you suddenly wake up and can no longer remember the content of your dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before emptying his deep memory, Roland definitely didn't want to end this dream ahead of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention the many households in the Soul Building - if they also have the door to memory debris, that's great information for understanding the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is possible that Jielu has no effect on dreams, but he does not want to take this risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the strange power in his body, Roland decided to go to the scene to see if he could help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the street, he ran along the road of the traffic, the heat flowed in his body, and the pace of speed did not feel too much. Even in the high-speed running room, Roland can easily control every part of the body and flexibly avoid the passers-by on the street. The three-kilometer journey is almost shortened by the speed of the 100-meter sprint. In just eight minutes, he arrives. The location of the incident. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what Roland didn’t expect was that he had just squeezed into the crowd, and he found that the robbers had already been shackled and was crying and interviewed. I was only impulsive at the moment, and the onlookers issued a scream of disappointment. When they came, they generally dispersed. The traffic police also packed up roadblocks and prepared to resume traffic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took a slap in the mouth, not that the police would always be late after the event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the passenger who was removed from the bus, he did not find the figure of Jieluo - it seems that this time it was white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to go back, there was a cry for help in the narrow alleys of the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned and looked into the alley, although the sunset had not completely settled, but the light had been completely obscured by the tall buildings on both sides, and the inside was black and lacquered. , nothing can be seen clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implications? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly walked to the alley, after a few minutes, once again heard a weak call for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really someone is inside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the police should be called to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked back at the bus and found that the police had been robbed of the robbers on the police car and headed away from the distance. It was obviously too late to stop them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think it is not heard? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he clearly felt that something in the alley was attracting himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since coming close to here, the heat flow in the body has suddenly become fierce, like noise, and like jubilation, as if urging him to move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland walked into the narrow alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes quickly adapted to the faint light, and he saw a man facing his back and having nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is you asking for help?" he asked, frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man did not answer, but directly rotated his head by 180 degrees. This strange scene made Roland take a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However more surprising is still behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
