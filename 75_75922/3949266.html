			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Roland returned to the office and continued to copy the basic mathematical knowledge of his mind onto paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not had the ability to remember, not only that, memory will decline with the passage of time. Due to professional relationships, mathematics and physics are often used in disciplines, and other knowledge such as history, geography, biology, and chemistry are estimated to have degraded to entry levels. Therefore, no matter what you don't need to use, you can save more knowledge by writing out what you haven't forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever he writes a piece of paper, he glances at the book next to him. As long as the content she has seen, it is equivalent to permanent preservation. Unfortunately, the ability of the book is only related to memory, and it does not enable her to teach the middle and high school mathematics without a teacher. Therefore, when it is empty, Roland will explain it to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, for him who is a good teacher, preaching is a very interesting thing. In particular, when he saw the book with a horror, or the expression of sorrowful thoughts after meditation, he also had a sense of accomplishment in his heart. However, Roland is clear that this has something to do with the subjects. Although the book is nearly forty years old, the magic makes her face aging slow down. The skin on the cheeks is still tight and rosy, and the long black hair is simply tied behind the head, which is mature and capable. The fine crow's feet at the corners of the eyes do not destroy the overall beauty, but rather bring out the steady temperament. In the movie, it is definitely the role of an elegant all-round teacher. Now, he can make the "teacher" stunned, and the contrast is quite useful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is thinking while meditating, what is the magic of this world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is everywhere, whether it is deep in the northern slope or in the mountains, in the west to the wild, east to the sea breeze, the witch can use it Casting all kinds of incredible power. If the magic is seen as electrical energy, the witch is a different function of electrical appliances. But obviously it is much more incredible than electricity, more like an energy close to the "source." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Hakala of the Co-Assistance Society, Wendy said that she can summon four kinds of magic snakes, namely death penalty, pain, petrification, nothingness, venom effect Not the same. Another example is the nightingale, and the unfolding fog almost distorts the space. The expressions of these abilities are ever-changing. In addition to the word origin, Roland can't think of other more appropriate words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give a definition of the source, it is probably a rule of universality and versatility. In the latter half of his life, Einstein was determined to incorporate the four fundamental forces of the universe into a theoretical framework, the so-called grand unified theory. In a sense, what he did was to find the source. So will there be a universal rule that can be applied in any universe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Roland unable to hold his head open, whether he will cross the former world, and there is such power, but there is no witch as a release window. Let it be ignored by people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, Roland can only think about it. After all, at the current level of technology, he can't analyze this power at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So promoting industrial development and promoting civilization progress is its main task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps one day, people can use this power directly without the help of a witch - a versatile super energy that can be converted into multiple effects at the same time, light It’s exciting to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness?" The book saw the prince's intoxicated appearance and couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," Roland returned from his thoughts, coughed twice, and looked at the candle that was about to burn. He said, "Come here today." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," she bowed her head and bowed, and when she was about to leave, she slowly slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland didn’t hear the door closing for a long time, and looked up strangely and found that the other person was still at the door. "What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness..." The book hesitated for a moment, "I want to ask you a question."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask." Roland nodded, put down the quill in his hand, lifted the cup and drank. These witches are all good, just a little, too confident. Like a rabbit heading out from the mouth of a cave, it was a little bit of wind and grass and it scared back into the hole and never dared to come out. Estimating her problems is such as why you are willing to host us, you are not afraid of the threat of the church. The nightingale and Wendy have already asked him many times. However, since the other party puts on such a gesture, they naturally have to answer them seriously, so that they can feel deeply that the comrades should be as warm as the spring breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
