			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the demon moon lasted for nearly five months. When the clouds dissipated and the ray of sunshine appeared again in the west, the spring had passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An urgent task is in front of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is spring farming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evil month where other forces are struggling, it is possible to save a lot of time by launching a war to conquer the extreme south, so that the next unified strategy can be carried out with ease, but the consumption of food It is also very amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the lack of progress, coupled with the rapid growth of the population, the granary in Bentham District saw the first time. Roland secretly thanked himself for the first thing after swallowing the long song fortress. He handed the "Golden No. 1" seed cultivated by the leaves to Pei's hands and ordered him to force the promotion of improved crops. Otherwise, this evil month is really bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cement ship that travels between Bentham and Changge constitutes the lifeline of the First Army, and a large number of wheat-ground rough-faced pancakes are distributed by shipping. In the hands of soldiers fighting in the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Roland held the Spring Farming Conference on the second day after the "Victory Day" celebration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than the Ministry of Agriculture, the entire city hall, including the second-level officials of the Changge District, and the district governor Pei Luo, the governor of the Longling, Speer, They were summoned to the castle without winter. Among them, Speer Passy was directly transported by the wheat scorpion. When he landed, his entire cheek was pale, and he also had a few more resentments when he saluted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of Calvin Kant, the lord of the temporary jurisdiction of the North, was replaced by his daughter Itis and the second son Cole. I don’t know if it is an illusion. Roland always felt that the North Pearl from the Snowy Mountain had a brighter look, and Cole behind her was a little weaker, and that set of clothes... was it too neutral? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, the meeting has gathered representatives from all parties in the Grey Fort, in addition to the unfinished East, and the Central Region that has not yet established the City Hall system. This is basically a national congress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around the hall with satisfaction and then knocked on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly calmed down and bowed their eyes to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you must be very strange, why do you use the word combat on the banner," Roland said, pointing to the red cloth banner hanging on the wall behind him, "because This is a war. It is not only related to whether this year's strategic plan can be implemented smoothly, but also determines the correctness of the winterless rule! As early as the beginning of the refugees, I promised that as long as they are willing to work hard, they will never There will be a day of hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did this for the last three years, and the territory expanded from a remote border town to more than half of the gray fort. It’s unreasonable that this year will not be realized. The people will only be stable if they don’t eat and drink. Therefore, I ask everyone to take the spring farming seriously and complete the cultivation this year according to the regulations and seeding manuals formulated by the Ministry of Agriculture.” He paused. "And from this year onwards, agricultural work will carry out special assessments, including the area of ​​reclamation, the number of farmers and the agricultural output, which will become the standard for measuring whether you are suitable to be in charge of the land!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the awkward participants, Roland couldn’t help but raise his lips. “It’s not important that you don’t understand what these assessments are. After that, Minister of Agriculture Sene will spend a day explaining them in detail. In short, if it’s not To the standard I requested, I can only show that my ability is limited and I am no longer suitable to continue to serve as the consul."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although everyone did not say anything, but from the look It can be seen that they are obviously nervous. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly what Roland wants. Cancel the aristocratic system. In addition to the ability to recover the land, one of the other things is that the territorial officials are no longer a lifetime hereditary system. He does not mind that these people enjoy their rights, but they are not allowed to drag down their development plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And agricultural assessment is only the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland unveiled a curtain behind him, revealing the numbers marked in uppercase red, "The first year's other standards can be relaxed, but in agriculture, this is produced. On one item, I ask you to reach this number!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
