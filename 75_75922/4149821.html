			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonton was so happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in addition to Mai Hao, there are other people who can understand her mermaid language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, whether Mai Hao really understands, Joan is not very sure, after all, the snoring of the other party is more difficult to understand, she can only guess only words at most. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but...what is the watcher? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She then asked, "Are you watching this big pit?" Where is it here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not a big pit, it's a bridge," the other smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen bridges, bridges are not like this. Joan walked carefully to the side of the hole and looked at the edge of the probe. The wall was covered with thick dirt and vines, and there was no way to find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not everyone can pass this bridge and must hold the key to get there." The woman explained, "You don't have a key, so you can't see it." The existence of "."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original is such a thing, Joan suddenly realized, but why do people who build bridges do this kind of thing? Is it not good to let people pass the big pit directly? And even if there is no key, everyone can go around from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watcher couldn’t help but smile. "Really...so, this is what I have to do - the arrival of the person waiting for the key, and then Open the bridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joan looked back at her for a moment before she started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t have a chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is no chain, why not leave the island? Joan pointed at the other side of the water mist. I saw that there was a continent not far from there. It should not take long to swim. Since it is not locked, I can take you away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party glimpsed a little, then shook his head with a smile. "Don't say this. You have a wound, what was it attacked?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan Although she did not understand why she suddenly changed a topic, she still consciously replied that she was scratched by a monster in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's lie down to me, I have some medicine here, just to bandage you." The woman waved her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, it’s the first time I saw it, but Joan felt that the other person was not a bad person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After her words, the watchman did not know where to take out a can of ointment, first applied to his hand, then carefully painted her wounds . A cool sense suddenly dispels the pain and fatigue of the body, just like the cool breeze in the heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"吖..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Comfortable?" After the drug is finished, the watchman will Tear your own skirt into a strip of cloth and tie it to the place where the medicine has been applied. "Right, where are you going next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go home, Qiong Damn, I want to go back to my friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you can't go in the direction of the shadow. There is a continent there, but it is not where you should go."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know that there is no winter city there? She likes to look out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... probably should be opposite the shadow, but it’s equally dangerous to take the land. You'd better swim along the coast."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not lie to you. But you better take a break, I can feel that your body is already overdraft."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other side, she did experience a long-lost feeling of relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, take a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly closed her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman rubbed Joan’s hair again and whispered, “I’m really not locked by a chain, but it’s not just a chain that can trap people. Sometimes, words More sturdy than the chain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I...do not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if you don't understand, because I don't even understand myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women's The sound seemed to come from far away, soft and quiet, and the consciousness of Joan began to blur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I can ask you a question... I’m stupid, but someone is smart, like Miss Anna, and Roland’s...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? It will bother you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will see you again...right? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, if there is a chance..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan is completely in a deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she woke up, she found that the sky was late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops, how long have I been sleeping? She slammed up and did not get the answer from Miss Watcher. Joan looked around in a panic, and there was no one around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, even the stone monuments are gone, except for the bottomless big hole, there is only an empty grassland and a flat top, as if seen before. Everything is illusory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that all a dream? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, Joan soon found out that her body still has a cloth strip for wrapping, but the cool feeling of immersing in the skin has disappeared without a shadow. trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hesitated to untie a piece of cloth, and did not find traces of the ointment on the scales, but the wound was cured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Joan’s face was stunned, there was a strange roar in the distance—<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; She only noticed at this time that the mists that surround the island did not know when they had all disappeared, and the shadows in the distance completely showed the whole picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a mountain, but it’s a bit too high, and it’s not enough to describe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, its size is really amazing - from a distance, the mountain is only afraid to add up from the south to the north of the fjord islands. Be broad. There is no tree on the mountain, and the place where the eye is located is dark, like dyed with ink. In addition, the mountain is covered with a layer of red mist, and from time to time there is a scarlet liquid spray! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Joan saw where the roar came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the foot of the mountain, countless monster sea boats rushed over the land like ants, stacked a thick layer on the beach, they spewed out again A venom that causes the black ground layer to disintegrate, and a piece of boulder collapses into the sea, and the entire coast is boiling! Although these monsters are a negligible part of Montenegro, it is this insignificant part that erodes the mountain a little bit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are not without any resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area where the ship could not reach, tens of thousands of sea ghosts collided with another monster, and Qiong recognized it for a while. Found that it is the devil that everyone often hangs on! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea ghosts that make sailors have a headache are just as fragile as the waves on the reefs. They are washed and splashed, but they don’t shake the defense of the devil. . Even so, the followers are constantly crossing the monster ship, rushing to the shore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
