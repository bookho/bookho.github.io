			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Tilly’s farewell, Roland spent all his time on the transcripts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the basic courses of various subjects, the textbooks written by memory before are not complete, and now have the opportunity to re-list the content hidden deep in the consciousness, naturally Fill in the missing parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there are no drawings of the existing equipment of the Winter City - there are still many gaps between the use and the use of the good, and these mature designs can be further improved. The efficiency of steam engines and machine tools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the guidance of the new design, Anna finally completed the prototype of the first steam turbine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the way of companionship with the past, Roland got the news and rushed to the backyard of the North Slope. They sat side by side on the workbench in the yard and enjoyed it together. This behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is nearly six meters in length, and the dense impeller is closely attached to the outer casing and looks like a huge metal roller. The external connection is a preheating boiler and a steam boiler. Under the heating of coal, the main shaft is driven by high pressure steam, which is superior to the reciprocating steam engine in terms of efficiency, noise and tremor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a new generation of the original power, the first machine will be used on the sea boat to meet the Thunder's exploration needs. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, despite its versatility, it is difficult for the factory to have the ability to process steam turbines in a short period of time, and Anna will soon be working on improving machine tools. In the meantime, there will be no second steam turbines coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" She leaned over and leaned against Roland's chin. "I am very good?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny is also different from most girls. When she is most happy, when she transforms the design drawings into physical objects, her pleasure and satisfaction will always be unrecognizable when she completes a major project. Hanging on the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that Anna is very interested in her current life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, second only to me," Roland smiled and wiped the stain on her cheek, wiping a shallow gray mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I saw her clear and transparent lake blue eyes, the words that promised the nightingale came to my mouth and swallowed back - although he has made up his mind To be honest with the other party, but actually do it to know how hard it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what excuse you are looking for, you can't alleviate this heavy weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent days, he has been transcribed books and sketches, and he wants to use his work to fill his leisure time and avoid the illusion of suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the delay is also a kind of injury, especially for the nightingale that is full of expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t always escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boiler was gradually cooled and the steam turbine stopped running, Roland took a deep breath and leaned into Anna’s ear to whisper, “I came to my bedroom at night, I I have something to say to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the night, he sat at the desk I can hear my heart pounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This era is not like modern society, no one cares about aristocrats with several women."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am just following my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one will feel counterintuitive."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s mind continually emerged, and in turn was vetoed by himself, as if there were two consciousnesses on the top of the head fighting each other. I wanted to fill in the last part of the transcript, but I ended up holding the pen and couldn't write a word for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the door was pushed away by Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
