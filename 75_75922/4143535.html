			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let. Beth never wants to be the enemy of the King of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have never really dealt with the Grey Fortress, the rumors about them have actually been heard a lot. The gods who swept the wolf heart and the winter were defeated in front of the Grey Fortress; the coalition forces that the morning aristocrats were rallying were defeated within one day; Roland Wimbledon was even more invincible in the kingdom, and the country was unified in just half a year; According to legend, the change of Dagong Island in the previous period, which also has the shadow of the gray fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that these rumors were amazing enough. I didn’t expect the First Army to fight against the alien devil in the past year - if it was The lord claimed that he would only sneer at it, but when he spoke from the command of the first army commander, the baron found that he did not dare to say suspicion easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, no matter whether it is true or not, Shenchiwan has no qualification for personal trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the plan of the King of the Grey Fort is too grand, or whimsical, if the other party wants only the wolf heart, then let Bate Do not hesitate to choose to work. But the truth is that the other party wants to evacuate the population of the two kingdoms! Listening to what the commander said, multi-channel advancement, sea and land transport in parallel, first in the villages and towns, there is really no posture to move. Most aristocrats don't care too much about the lives of the people, as long as they die in value or can return enough benefits. But moving it all is another matter. It means that the territory is empty, the grain can't be collected, the tax falls to the bottom, and the industry is unattended... unless everything is irreparable, it will never be easily agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the First Army is stronger, it is difficult to be an enemy of all nobles at the same time? After all, this is not a gray fort. Without the support of the locals, the burden of marching and logistics will be greatly increased. However, they still want to divide their troops. It is like treating the nobles of the two countries as air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a while, let. Bate whispered, "I don't quite understand why the King of Graysburg must do this. In case the devil does not I intend to attack beyond the desolate mountains, and we can fully support him here. But once people are gone, cities, farmland, and mines will be ridiculous, and such losses are hard to estimate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't answer your question. As the first commander, my only task is to complete the task of your Majesty. But..." The iron axe paused. "As long as you go there once, no winter." City, you should be able to get the answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then I have only one last question left..." The baron licked a little dry hair. Lips, "You said before, the nobility is voluntary. If I decide to go with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe nodded and pointed to the civil servant around him," This is the relocation officer of the Wintertown Executive Office, Remy, who will tell you what you mean."<br /><br />&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, Mr. Baron, then you are a member of the Grey Fort Kingdom." The personnel officer quickly flipped the documents at hand. "First of all, it is certain that Roland Wimbledon is A benevolent lord, he will not be ill-treated to anyone who pays for the Grey Fort. Since the Grey Fort has cancelled the system of aristocratic aristocracy and the national unified law, you will lose the inheritance and sequestration rights of the land. But as an experienced Managers, you can join the Executive Office to become a district governor, or to open up new territories for the rest of the world - such as the fertile plains. Of course... If the devil did not invade the four kingdoms, you want to continue to manage Shen Chiwan is also ok. Fortunately, the area you are responsible for is likely to be many times larger than it is now. After all, not every nobleman will make this choice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the document is very long. The other party has read almost a quarter of an hour before it stops, and all aspects have been considered, obviously not made up in a short time. Jean Bate realized that the person who wrote this thing must be a great minister, and he asked himself that he could never write such a comprehensive instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, content is to exchange long-term benefits with short-term benefits. As long as it performs well, he can get far more than a harbor collar. Whether the two are worthwhile in comparison is a question that varies from person to person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of an unknowable future, it’s not wise to make a hasty decision, but when it’s bad enough now, it’s not so important to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of being hanged or burned, expecting at least one more way to live in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
