			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, I am leaving." Ai Gesha is right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go," Zoe’s face also showed a cold smile. "My sisters should have been waiting for a long time."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the First Army, the commander of the ancient witch is also a powerful warrior. When the devil approaches, they have no reason to retreat first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Ai Gesha, Ms. Zoe..." The iron axe suddenly stopped the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although this may not be up to me Say, but I think that you must think so," he said solemnly. "Please protect yourself. You are the biggest blow to the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, I didn't have a good sleep before I regained Takira," Zoe looked back and glanced at him. "Thank you for your words, mortal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Do not worry, I know what to do." Aegusa smiled and followed the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark shadows in the sky are very obvious. Compared with the last winter city defense war, the number of enemies has been turned over several times, and the flight speed is also fast. many. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, they approached the front of the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-altitude machine guns in the front row fired one after another, and the intensive guns quickly joined together, but the effect was not obvious, only sixty fearful beasts Four or five were shot down, and the rest of the devils further pulled up the height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A disgusting big moth," Zoe irritated. "If they dare to fall to the ground, I can tear them with my hands." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the era of the federation, the most effective means of dealing with such monsters is the flying witch who has the ability to fly, and the extraordinary who wears the flying magic stone. This is also one of the reasons why the ancient witches despised the mortal army. Without them, only a few beasts could chase a large army and flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't they throw a spear?" Looking at the enemy who had already flown above the position, Ai Gesha could not help but frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next moment, the devil’s intentions are unmistakable—only seeing them push down the head of the mount one by one, swooping toward the back of the line of defense, and there is The location of the artillery battalion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and did not hesitate to run towards the artillery position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the fish ball is located right in the middle of the position, since the last time After the devil was attacked, he was promoted to be the squad leader because of his outstanding performance. Although it was not the first time to deal with these monsters, the fish balls still felt the fear involuntarily when they saw the black-pressed beasts rushing toward him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Class, squad leader, still not firing?" asked the teammates holding the bullet belt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are approaching the 900-meter range!" The watchman also looked like a blue-green, stunned throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is afraid, he realizes that even the most daring person will feel heartfelt fear in front of this incredible enemy. Because of this, he has to be more calm, otherwise they will collapse without the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the fish balls swallowed and deliberately slowed down the speed. "Wait a minute, wait until three hundred meters to shoot again."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the firearms instructor claimed that the Mark 1 heavy machine gun had a killing distance of more than 1,500 meters and the sighting range of the sight was about a kilometer, the actual experience made him understand that unless The fearful beast flies in a smooth straight line and it is possible to hit the target within this distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective method of shooting is to throw away the complex sight of the gun, directly use the concentric ring to cover the opponent, and rely on the feeling to estimate the advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He prefers to shoot when he is sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the distance also means that the enemy can launch a counterattack at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This baffle that can only be sent in front of the machine gun is strong enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They rushed down!" The screamer screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish pill presses the trigger violently - he seems to be able to see Arrange the bullets into a row, sprinkle them into the air, and then smash the giants that hit them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foremost beast in the forefront instantly turns into a red and blue blood fog, and at least one dozen bullets from different directions run through its body. The madman sitting behind is not so good. The skull is completely opened, and the lower limbs are broken into two pieces. When they fall, they almost have no human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The death of the enemy caused a burst of cheers from the team, and also injected a warm stream of courage into the heart of the fish ball. He sighed and raised the muzzle to another A fearful beast, and after a few seconds let it step on the footsteps of the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fish balls are ready to work hard, the surroundings suddenly dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the top of his head, there was a gray curtain, and even the sun was blocked. Only a flash of light could be seen through the gap. - And when he saw the true face of the "curtain", he only felt that his heart was tightening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a spear--!" He used all his strength and shouted loudly, "Attention to avoid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, such a dense spear attack has nowhere to hide. The only thing that everyone can do is to shrink the head and body under the gun shield, as for the exposed hands and feet. It can only be resigned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish pills hold their teammates tightly, and are even ready to be pierced by bone spears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected crashes did not come, he only felt a gust of wind passing over the head, and the sky returned to brightness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Class, squad leader! Look behind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish pill turned back and the chest jerked up - I saw the artillery position in the back was a mess, the dust was thrown everywhere, and some people fell. On the ground, life and death are unknown, and the dusty and foggy places can still hear the wounded and helpless voices of the wounded, and the six-door fortress cannons are also dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qianlong," everyone couldn't help but swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do!" Fish balls bite their teeth and scream, "Now go back to the seat and give me a shot!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is a rescue or a substitute, there is a person in charge. What he has to do now is to shoot down as many beasts as possible before the enemy launches a second wave of spears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This screaming made the soldiers wake up and the two high-altitude machine guns screamed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the devil apparently realizes that it is difficult to completely disintegrate the opponent’s will to fight by the inefficient bone spear attack, so the beast group is divided into two batches, half pulling Elevation, waiting for the next attack, while the other half fell directly to the ground, intending to use their own strengths to defeat the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A madman just jumped from the beast and met a dark-haired man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male human is not at all worried about it, it takes out the iron axe at the waist and slams it to it -<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the other party blocked its slash with only one hand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madman couldn’t help but widen his eyes. Before he could think about why, he saw the other person aiming a bare iron pipe at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
