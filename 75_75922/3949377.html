			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condition of the bell stabilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the odd arrangement of the initial boarding, the mercenaries carrying wooden guns divided everyone into groups, and they were savage and critical. Carrying the treatment into the strange wooden house, followed by the order of the young, the family with the children, and the adults. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia and the bells are at the forefront - the whole treatment process is very fast, blindfolded, she is holding her sister, walking with the help of mercenaries Into the hut. Without waiting for a long time, someone put a pill into her hand. The meatballs are small and slightly sweet, and the other party also tells her that the sister's medicine has been fed by them so that she does not have to worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she walked out of the room and took off her hood, she was pleasantly surprised to see that the color of the bell was getting better with the naked eye. Although she was still in a coma, her forehead was no longer Then hot, the flushing on the face faded, and the dark spots disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone is freed from the fear of dying, when they regain their lives, they are almost too excited to be self-sufficient, and they are kneeling down to the gray man in the distance. Cheers, paying him the highest respect. From the mercenary's mouth, he was the lord of the place, and he was in charge of the West, and Roland Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, exactly the same as the rumors, the lord adults not only ignited the bonfire on the dockside, but also told them to be small. When the town is doing things, you can get rewards, food and shelter here. While enjoying the fragrant meat porridge, everyone talked about it and said that they had fortunately boarded the fleet to the West and praised His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Lucia felt a bit anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can she contact the General Counseling Association? The secret message only said that a group of witches stayed in Bianbu Town, but did not mention how to find them - probably lost important parts in the process of communication, she faintly heard, the news spread from the big cities in the middle of the kingdom of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone filled their stomachs and was guided by the mercenaries to the wooden shed by the river, a woman’s voice suddenly appeared behind Lucia. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you looking for us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was shocked and turned back Two steps forward, ready to escape, but when the appearance of the coming into her eyes, Lucia could not help but stand in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, that is a beautiful woman, the long curls are soft orange under the swaying fire, the eyes are as bright as the stars, the corners of the mouth are exposed Sweet smile. The most striking thing is that her temperament is not inferior to any nobleman, as if she is a big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Nightingale, a witch, welcome to the West Town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This feeling made Lucia unable to help but bow down. "I... my name is Lucia White, I want to join you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So follow me Come on," the nightingale smiled. "I will take you home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the sun has fallen into the mountains, leaving only a faint glow in the sky. West Asia was carrying a sleepy bell and slowly followed behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did you wake up?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Awakening?" Lucia groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The moment it turns into a witch," the Nightingale explained. "From now on, your body will continue to gather magic, and we call this transformation awakening. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think... probably two years ago," Lucia recalls. "Is magic the power of the demon?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's just the church's rhetoric," she shook her head. "Magic is the power that God has given us, and has nothing to do with good and evil. The so-called evil devil, but when the magic is full. The reflexion of the body can be avoided by practicing the ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you not bear the pain?" Lucia widened her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All died, only me and the bell escaped," Lucia said for a moment. "A group of people attacked Jinsuicheng, burning and looting everywhere. My father was pierced by his chest to resist them." Mother let us run fast, and the result is also..." A sorrow that has been suppressed for a long time comes to my heart, so that she can no longer speak the complete words. The hardships, hunger, thirst, and fear that endured along the way all turned into grievances. For the sake of her sister, she insisted that the line of defense that she had built up in her heart could no longer stop the violent ups and downs. It became a loud cry, she knew that this was not good, she should keep the etiquette when she first met, but the tears were like a storm, and she couldn’t stop it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to be hated by the other party? She felt her tears and nose mixed together, and her mouth was full of salt. What surprised Lucia, however, was that a pair of arms wraped around and held her into her warm arms. The other patted her back on her head. She didn’t care about the dirty things on her face that were washed with tears. Road: "Cry, cry out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mood in West Asia was calm, and when I looked up, I saw that the shoulders of the other side were soaked by my tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, sorry..." She blushes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, is it better?" The night handkerchief helped her wipe her face, holding the bell in one hand and holding her in the other hand." Let's go, there are many sisters waiting for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia thought that the witches’ residence would be located in an obscure warehouse and In the basement, I didn’t expect the nightingale to bring her into the castle area – isn’t it the private territory of the lord? What surprised her even more was that the guards not only did not stop her, but also waved to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you help the entire town to control it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When on the third floor of the castle, when she walked into a brightly lit room, the man she was sitting on the opposite side was the one who had received the cheers before. Lord Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the leader of the Witch Alliance, His Royal Highness Roland Wimbledon. He has hosted the witches who survived the Aid, and spread the news to other cities, hope Can bring in more sisters who have nowhere to live," said the nightingale. "And this town is the home of the witches. You don't have to doubt this because the younger sister who treated your sister and all the patients on the boat, It’s a witch.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia’s head is blank, she never thought that there would be no aristocrats willing to accept witches, instead of treating witches as tools or slaves. . When she came back, she only panicked and bowed, and the strange posture of the shape made the nightingale unable to bear to laugh. "It doesn't matter, His Highness doesn't care about these etiquettes."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You come from the east?" The voice of the Lord's adult is peaceful and relaxed, not like a question, it is like chatting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia sneaked at the other side and saw that he was sitting on the chair casually, and his expression was full of interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the in-depth conversation and the explanation of the nightingale, she added The mood has gradually relaxed. Although the other party is an aristocrat, there is no aggressive attitude. It is like an elder who cares about himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that two years of awakening, now not yet mature..." he said with great interest, "So, what is your ability?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return an item back to its original appearance," Lucia hesitated. "But it doesn't work for everything."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original look?" His Royal Highness touched his chin and pushed a beautiful cup to the table. "Can you show it to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will destroy it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lucia nodded, went to the table and placed her hand over the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, the cup began to shrink and deform, eventually turning into three distinct substances: the leftmost one looks like a beach oil, dark and sticky In the middle is a small cluster of black powder, while the rightmost one is a clear water, which is slowly dripping down the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
