			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bianzi Town ushered in a long-lost rainy day, the clouds in the sky, the rain fell from the sky, hit the window sill and the glass, making a loud noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands to reason that spring should be a rainy season, warm and humid. However, in Bianbu Town, since the end of the demon moon, the number of rains is very small. Fortunately, the farmland is on the edge of the river and it is very convenient to water it. Nowadays, a heavy rain dispels the boring air, and the nightingale opens the window, letting the earthy and fragrant atmosphere flood into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From afar, you can see that the crops on the other side of the Chishui River have already sprouted new sprouts, and the green and oily wheat sprouts continue to extend to the end of the field of vision. Under the washing of the rain, these crops are extremely bright, in stark contrast to the gray river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stretched out and threw the quill in his hand into the pen holder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drawing?" asked the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the new weapon can make the fire gun fire several times faster," Roland put together more than a dozen design drawings, "I took it." Named the runner rifle. Want to see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't look," she grinned. "I don't understand anyway."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is just the basic type. If the barrel is shortened, it is a revolver that can be carried around. But if you want it to come in handy, you need to solve another key technology. When you give one to you, you no longer have to fear the judges of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, it can make an ordinary woman, Knock down a heavily armed big man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not one, it’s several." Roland smiled smugly. "If you are lucky, five big men." It’s not a problem.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale showed an unbelief, just wanted to say something, and the door suddenly sounded knocking outside the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Highness, Barov's apprentice has returned from the king, he also brought a saltpeter merchant, and is now waiting for your interview outside the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentice of the Assistant Minister? Roland thought about it and remembered it. When attacking the Long Song Fortress, the town's gunpowder stock was running low. He sent his guards to fall to Longling and Chishui City, hoping to get a new source of saltpeter. Barov’s apprenticeship was the one sent at the latest, and the destination was Wangdu. After all, there are products there, and as summer is approaching, the output of saltpeter will definitely increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the person who sent the party at the latest brought the first good news back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take them to the living room, I will be there soon." Roland looked at the sky, "Let the kitchen have a dessert."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look back, the nightingale is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows that she is by her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland walked into the living room, the saltpeter merchants were just taken over by the guards. Inside. She took off her wet cloak and straw hat and bowed to the prince. "I am Margaret Farmman from the kingdom, pay tribute to you, Dear Wimbledon.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the person is actually a woman, Roland is a little glimpse. The business environment of this era is far less safe than that of later generations. When running east and west, it is not only likely to encounter thieves and displaced people, but also towns and local snakes. Underground forces, so female businessmen are rare.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has the same bright hair as lightning, but her hair is more dense and longer. About thirty years old. Years old, perhaps because of ordinary people, her eyes and forehead have wrinkles. The skin is darker and looks a bit rough. But from the face, it is not a Mo Jin people, but like a fjord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sit down," the prince made a gesture of action, then sat down in the Lord. "You are not a Grey Fortress, right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you say that? Margaret smiled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
