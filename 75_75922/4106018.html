Apparently she just used this finger to play with his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... is it?" Roland cleared his throat and pretended to look at the statistical report. "Probably today's weather is especially suitable for naps." For the sake of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is not the first day of a daze," the nightingale returned to the lounge chair next to the camp, "after the last time I came back from the reflection church It’s always been the case. What happened?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland subconsciously wants to veto, but when the words come to a standstill, the lie is ineffective, and the lie is not valid for the nightingale, and he also I can't deceive myself - even if it's been a week, I still can't understand it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I found some problems... just, it's too weird, I don't know how to explain it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't say it, you don't have to tell me," said the nightingale, holding the back of his head and looking at heaven. "My head is not good for you anyway, even if it is said that it will not help you. If it is Anna. If you can, you can help -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't tell her." Roland smiled and shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... is it?" The nightingale immediately turned over from the lounge chair. "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the difference in this matter is beyond the scope I can understand," he bluntly said, "but it can't affect anything, in other words, it's just my personal trouble. Tell her to add trouble. It doesn't make sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that." The night squinted and revealed a look of ignorance, but Roland knew she didn't listen at all. Understand, but I don’t know what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So don't tell me about my old daze," he muttered. "These questions can't be solved except myself." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, of course!" Somehow, the nightingale suddenly became happy. She first patted her chest, then took a piece of grilled fish from the bag and threw it into her mouth. Inside, a look of satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stabilizing the other party, Roland sighed secretly, though his eyes were looking at the statistics, but he couldn’t see it at all, and his mind was always floating in the church room. Sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is a fictional character appearing in the early days of the union? Even from the portrait, she existed earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, Roland asked Isabella, Aisha, and Felice, but the answer was whether the history was for Tacila. Too far away, no one can tell who the background paintings at the vows meeting are, and can only infer that she was famous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He always thought that there are two kinds of people in the dream world, one is the ruined by the sorrow, they are bound in the soul building, and The world is still inextricably linked. The most obvious feature is that it has almost the same appearance and the memory fragments in the residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is the fictional, they come from the dream background, part of which is extracted from his brain, and part of which is fabricated by the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now his cognition has been shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Isabella, the life span of Jieluo is roughly between two hundred and two hundred and fifty, and her journey to serve the pope also corresponds. Record, this should not go wrong. Then the question is coming. How do you see that this "never aging" pure person can't swallow a character eight hundred years ago - her age may be amazing for ordinary people, but it will not be put into history. What is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
