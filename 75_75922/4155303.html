			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s ugly." Tilly snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also smiled politely - if the words of the four kingdoms are distorted like cockroaches, then the devil's is more complicated, so much so that It looks a bit like a witchcraft symbol. In addition, he is completely transcribed by memory, and his strokes are not very skilled, which makes the overall sense of consciousness more messy. God knows that Heikezode can understand what these words mean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also questioned Wakiris, but was refuted by the categorical rebuttal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believes that it is more feasible to imitate by human beings, which proves that she has not lost her consciousness and can show her own dilemma. Ways to convey the message. If she directly engraves her handwriting, it is easy to be cautious by Heikezod who suspects fraud. After all, I can send a personal letter, why not leave the consciousness world directly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what is the letter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let the Scorpio Lord try to avoid The frontal battlefield, so this letter needs the staff to find a way to the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother, are you okay?" Tilly looked shocked Tao, "How can the enemy's Maharaja listen to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't take much to try anyway..." Roland pretends to have an indifferent look. "What if it becomes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he also asked about the nightmare. The other party’s reply is that the life of the high-order devil tends to be as high as In the past 100 years, their habits and culture have changed a lot, so the text will leave a distinct personal mark, which is more reliable than any coat of arms or emblem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Roland’s understanding, it’s almost like after seeing Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Tilly reluctantly collected the stationery, "since you are please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Just as she was preparing to leave, the north slope lab phone on the desk suddenly rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland lifts the microphone, the caller is Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to what the other person said, he raised his mouth slightly and gestured to Tilly. "You should not hurry today, take a rest in the castle." I happen to have something new that I want to give you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lab In the middle, Tilly saw the "revolutionary" new product in Roland's mouth - two square wooden boxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no exaggeration to say that they are a box. Not only can the side cover see the obvious gap between the cover and the loose leaf, but the overall size is also about 30 cm. It seems that it can be directly In the hands of this, this size is very different from the amazing mechanical creations before, and even with a little momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference between the two and other ordinary boxes is that they are covered with a shiny metal plate with knobs and Press the button. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mobile radio." Anna took the initiative to explain, "It is equivalent to the reduced telegraph tower. The advantage is that the sound can be transmitted directly, of course, the distance is much closer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out so...etc." When Tilly paused, she looked at Roland. "Is this the new communication tool you said before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the other party has already painted her for a long time ago The pie, but she didn't expect the final product to be so delicate! Even if you can install an airplane, you should occupy most of the space on your belly. After all, the size of the tower project is there, and it is incredible to reduce it to the level of the Skyfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland seemed to see her doubts and reached out to open the top of the wooden box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cluster of interlaced lines and components suddenly appeared in front of her eyes, although I don’t understand the principle, Tilly has realized that this thing and the past Mechanical devices are fundamentally different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
