			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade cuts into the armor cleanly, and the blood splashes out of the gap, like a tiny red line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recruiter unexpectedly did not scream, but clenched his teeth and seized the hand of her sword, as if to fight for opportunities for his companions . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, he ignored the huge power gap between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy-six easily broke away from his grip, pulling out the sword while kicking him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place being kicked was like a blunt blow, the whole armor was smashed down, and the Cavaliers spit out a bloody foam, and there was no sound after lying on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it’s still convenient for his own fists. On the 76th, he swept his eyes and only collapsed to fill the gap with his sword. Just throw it at On the one hand, he directly rushed to other people with his bare hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalker instantly became a prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaps high and wanders around the clumsy knight's shoulder. Every time she falls on the top of a person's head, she grips the helmet with her feet and the body rotates with inertia. In a circle, you can hear the crisp sound of cervical fracture. Before the opponent fell, she had left her feet and jumped to the next enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers’ counterattacks and evasion are no different from a wooden stake, compared to the lighter movements of the 76th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it doesn't fall to the top of the enemy, then there is nothing, whether it is to use the strike joint to make the enemy lose balance, then make up a deadly foot, or rely on the body It is easy for her to seduce the opponent and let them cut the edge of the front and back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...Impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"damn monster!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several rounds, the Cavaliers have already had their enemies unable to use common sense, not only infinitely powerful, but also knowing swordsmanship and melee combat, it is a complete The skilled warrior, whose precise means of killing can't be seen, can't be linked to the 20-year-old woman in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You give me away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a big drink, Sir Rogan The horse rushed into the crowd, pulled up the front hoof and stepped on the 76th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others quickly helped seal the gap and tried to trap her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#76# 咧 嘴 , , , 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七 七Do not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then her move made everyone unable to believe their eyes - I saw the jazz and the mount were lifted off the ground by her, then went around The knight swept across. The person who was hit was slightly vomiting and vomiting blood, but he was killed on the spot. The Jazz himself was naturally the worst one. After being knocked down from the horse, the body had been twisted into an abnormal shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surviving chasers have collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They turned their heads and rushed to escape from this place, so the farther away from the monster, the better, but the 76th obviously will not give them this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the enemy gives up resistance, it is no different from the slaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the 76th record of all battles has been processed, the sky is already It was completely dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s body was thrown into the farmland not far away, and the basic cover was made with the sprinkled straw, although it is sooner or later. However, at that time, the witches should also withdraw into the gray fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She digs into the most luxuriously decorated carriage, breaks the cushion that lie flat on the day, and carefully pulls out a piece from the cushion. Colorful light magic stone ring. Even in the faint moonlight, you can see that there is a cluster of cyclones in the crystal-clear interior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
