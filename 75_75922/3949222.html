			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the good times did not last long. In the winter of her fourteen years old, there was a riot in the Yinguang City, and the parents who gave food to the displaced people never returned. The nightingale and the younger brother were sent to another branch of the Graun family, the home of her father's brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also that winter, the nightingale was awakened to the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She carefully hides her abilities, but she is still discovered by Lao Glan, who has taken her brother away from her and threatened her nightlife with her brother’s life. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night can only be done, she was specially trained by the thieves’ guild members who were brought by Lao Gelan, and then did some unspeakable things for him, such as sneak into business The opponent’s family steals contracts and documents, overheards the meetings of the city hall, and later, even put poison in the tanks or glasses of some potential competitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glan's business is getting bigger and bigger, but his attitude toward the nightingale is getting worse. If there is something that doesn't go well, she will punch her. Hit the kick. In addition to doing things for himself, he closed the nightingale in the room and replaced the iron railings. The most disturbing and incomprehensible thing is that his younger brother, Hyde, almost never came to see her. She began to wonder if Old Gülen had killed his brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under her repeated demands, she brought her brother with disgust. However, Hyde told the nightingale with a look of disappointment. I really hope that without her sister, the witch should go to hell to accompany the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night owl suddenly collapsed, but the nightmare was not over yet, and Old Gülen gave her the final blow - she became the secret of the witch, it was Hyde who told herself The reason is to leave the witch side, the farther the better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sending Hyde, Old Gülen warned her coldly that his younger brother would inherit his father’s title in adulthood, but if the nightingale does not continue to obey his orders, he is always All can let the younger brother die silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the nightingale is in desperation and great grief, such as puppets, usually controlled by the Graham family. In the snowy month of her imminent adulthood, she met Wendy on her way home. Or, it was Wendy who found her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I learned that there was a witch’s help, I learned that there are still many sisters who have suffered misfortunes like her, but have not given up their resistance. Suddenly, a little ignition star was ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From confusion to determination, she did not spend too much time. In the adult day after a week, she gritted her teeth and the power changed. The fog is not just a hidden figure, she finds that the iron railings can no longer stop themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the symptoms of adulthood were restored, she stepped into the old Gülen's bedroom in a night, and cut his neck with a dagger. Seeing a few feet high blood and the inhalation of the other party, she unexpectedly found herself calmer than she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore after leaving the Glan House at night, as for her younger brother Hyde, she no longer wants to pay attention to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, she and Wendy set foot on the journey to find a co-help club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After telling the night, wait a moment, see the prince still immersed in the past, and then retire. It took Roland a long time to return to God. It must be said that every witch has a long history of bitterness, and that she can live to adulthood and is one of the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you cross it, you can become a prince, and you are so lucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Roland went to the nightingale room to visit Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a full night of rest, Wendy’s look looked a lot better, and the attached arm also recovered. Despite her weakness, she still propped up her body and bowed to the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I already know about your business, thank you for saving the night's life," Roland took a piece of parchment from his arms and opened the door to see the mountain. "Nothing." It is no doubt that Hakala can no longer accept you to return to the co-help club. It is better to stay in Bianbu Town and work for me. If you agree, sign this contract. The salary is the same as Anna, one gold dragon every month. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness..." The night squinted and blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
