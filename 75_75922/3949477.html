			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning only feels that the goose bumps are coming out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly remembered the stories that circulated among the explorers - the demons who climbed out of the abyss, the ghosts of resentment, or the sorrows Undead. They are all the nightmare of the explorer. Even if the four eyes can take away the lives of people, illusions and deception are the tricks they are good at. Do you hide such monsters in this ruin? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Thunder said that these stories are just nonsenses written by some third-rate explorers, she still feels the shake of her heart at this moment. Otherwise, who else can still be screaming for months after being under the siege of the devil, even the tone and interval have not changed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is now faced with a dilemma - if it is a legendary evil, killing all the devils, it seems that it is difficult to escape badly. But if the other party really insists on the present, then the devil should still be in the ruins. What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hesitated for a moment, she decided to fly back to find the wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Briefly tell the story, Mai Haoang first said: "We can put out the fire, quietly touch it, so the devil can not see us." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, but we can't see them anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can become Owl," the pigeon yelled on her face. "It’s hard to beat me in the dark night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning eyes lit up, "This is a good The way, though... those legendary evils have lived in the darkness of their lives for a lifetime. Is there a way to find prey? Otherwise they should have starved to death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Don't you say that they are all made up to scare people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not me, my dad." The little girl corrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the same, anyway, I have never heard of the undead monsters in the Grey Fort. If they are so terrible, they should not stay in the gorge. A small place in the bay?" A ray of light appeared on the wheat stalk, and the pigeon suddenly swelled into a taupe owl, and his eyes were full of eagerness. "I thought you would be very familiar with these legends." Interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, if you are a qualified explorer, you will never miss an opportunity to verify the legend. What's more, she still has a heartbreak that needs to be crossed. If she flees in the past, she will lose all her efforts. Lightning hesitated for a moment, and decided to do what Mai said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, etc... I came here because I needed to overcome my fears. Why is the other party so interested in exploring the remains? Is it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't wait for it, isn't it for that basket of eggs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The owl licked the big round eyes and turned his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again standing at the entrance to the basement, the lightning took a few deep breaths. Hold the revolver in your hand and walk lightly into the deep darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the reason that Mai Hao was on the shoulder, she felt that she was much calmer than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground feels very moist, and from time to time it will encounter a pool of water. Here, the terrain is low, and the rainwater falling into the tower will slowly gather downwards. Although there are dark trenches in the general basement, after hundreds of years of wind and rain, these dark trenches may have been blocked for seven or seven. Eighty-eight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 patted her head with her wings, which meant a downward step in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning slowed down, a little bit of the edge of the ladder, and then carefully leveled down, after turning a corner, she suddenly saw the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft yellowish light shines from the end of the stairs and sprinkles on the ground, reflecting the ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
