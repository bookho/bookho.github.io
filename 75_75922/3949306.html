			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleania did not expect to be a member of the messenger group one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, when the church sent the messenger group, the team members have always been elite warriors, not only civil and military, but also the appearance of the church. She is very confident in her fighting skills and the court etiquette. She can talk about the appearance... A year-round rushing in the line of defense, where can a woman who swings with a big sword all day can see where to go? Thinking of this, she was a little uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, the official, said that they are going to the western town of the Grey Fort Kingdom to negotiate a sacred incident of the king. In addition to the commanding officers, the ambassador was composed of ten trials, one of whom was the cold captain who had a side in the Hermes defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now it seems that even if he is not in the battle, he is still wearing a cold face, just standing next to him, Eleania will I feel that the temperature has dropped a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sacred priest is the opposite. She is over forty years old and has a pair of wise eyes. She always smiles and talks about the anecdote of the church. She is knowledgeable and enthusiastic and has no demeanor. Even in front of the Archbishop, her style is still unabated. More than once, Eleania heard that she is likely to be the candidate for the next bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the female warrior was surprised that, as a civil servant, Mila’s riding was no worse than other trials. She has been leading the team for the past two days. Walking at the forefront, from the woods to the town trails, she can keep the horses at a constant speed while reducing physical exertion. This skill can only be mastered by a trial army that has long been trained in riding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are not heading south?" After leaving the land of Hermes and entering the Greysburg Kingdom, someone in the team asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Bianbu Town is too far away from us. If I am on the road, I don't want my butt to be ground." Mira waved, "Let's go east first." Go to Glentown, where there is a river leading to Chishui City. Chishui City will soon be a long song fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When did you join the church? "Ailesia asked curiously, "not only knows the anecdotes of the Holy City, but also the world of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twelve years ago At that time, I was exactly thirty years old." Mila replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So late," she was surprised. "As far as I know, the older it is, the harder it is to understand the teachings of the gods. You have only spent ten years on it. It is incredible that the believer is promoted to the priesthood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Mila smiled. "This is the fascination of the church. I, originally. It is the daughter of a merchant, following his father’s business in the four kingdoms, bringing ordinary goods from some places to another place, and the price will be several times worse. For example, the green coral of Haifeng County was purchased from local fishermen, only one of the two. Thirty silver wolves. Put them into the water tank and bring them to the palace of the Yongdong Kingdom. You can switch to a golden dragon. The color is good, the shape of the branches is even, and you can even sell more than five. I often think that it is the same piece. Why do you have two different identities?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because... things are rare?" Eleania said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I started thinking so too." The priest nodded. "But what happened later changed my opinion. A nobleman in Wangdu secretly hid A witch who can change the temperature, he came up with various ways to finally raise corals from Haifeng County in the cold winter king. He transformed the basement in the yard into a huge pool, and the skylight on the top was light. I can harvest once a year, and each output is more than the amount we travel to and from the Ten Commandments. And this long trade route, my father will only run once a year. So the green coral on the market has increased, he not only Sold to the palace, also sold to the big nobility. If it is rare, the price of green coral should be reduced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only two years later, the palace refused to accept the low-priced green corals, which they thought were counterfeit. The corals sold by my father not only did not cut prices, but doubled. As for the nobles who stole the witches, they were taught. Come out, according to the crime of confession and women I was tied to a firearm and burned to death. But I know that the coral he raised is not a counterfeit, it is no different from the green coral that my father carries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Things are rare, not the wrong idea, there are many reasons to determine the price of goods, this is just the simplest example - because the Yongdong Palace uses the green coral as a symbol of luxury, artificially stipulated its value. When more green corals appeared, the rules of the royal family were shocked, so on the day of execution, the Queen also celebrated a lot. Do you think these goods are not like us?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
