			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the dockside, more than a dozen sailboats lined up in a line, and the top of the mast and the staggered twine had been wrapped in snowflakes to form a white silver line, and the refugees The cabin was squished out and rushed to the open space in front of the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time that Bianbu Town has received refugees from all over the Grey Fort. The whole process is in order. The four-iron railing divides the crowd into two slender columns that control both the flow of people and the ability to step on. On both sides of the railing are police officers holding a short stick to patrol, and those who push and attempt to cross the railing will pick up a stick. There are rewards for nature and rewards – in order to appease the people who have arrived through the hardships, the refugees who pass through the railings can get a bowl of steaming porridge. In any case, filling your stomach first can effectively reduce the panic and discomfort of refugees in unfamiliar territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, in addition to the police, the First Army and the City Hall officials, the Nightingale and Sylvie also participated in the inspection, in order to find those who are A drug smuggler placed in the crowd. In the eyes of the magic eye, no matter whether it is a pill or a snow powder, there is nowhere to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for all this for the West," Roland retracted his eyes and said to Margaret next to him, "If it weren’t for your fleet, these people I am afraid I have to spend the winter in the slums of other cities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s rare for my Highness to ask me for help in such an urgent tone, I naturally have to go all out," She smiled. "But many crew members are reluctant to sail on a snowy day, so they can only get together such thirteen ships."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Total than a ship Nothing is better," Roland spit out. Since learning that a large number of refugees have been stranded in Silver City, Chishui City and Liuye Town, he sent a letter of assistance to the Margaret Chamber of Commerce, hoping that the other party can collect a fleet to help them transport the refugees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the 13 ships are less, but more than two runs can always bring people back - according to a sailboat in a hundred people, It takes two weeks to calculate one round trip, and the three thousand stranded people will take about one and a half months. The Golden Dragon carried by the First Army squad could not support that time, so this return trip had to carry food and cold-resistant clothing. Roland did not want refugees to take the boat to the sea, but eventually could not reach the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the blessing of lightning, Margaret finally set the transportation cost twice as much as usual. For other businessmen, I definitely think that this is a stupid sale - the freight is more than the value of the goods, the average shipping cost per two people, according to the current market price, you can buy several strengths. Strong quality slaves. Margaret also questioned him, but Roland still insisted on bringing this group of people back to the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the moment they followed the messenger on the sailboat, they were considered to be the people of the West, and they had the responsibility to provide them with shelter. Moreover, in the eyes of Roland, the value of these refugees is far from being comparable to that of slaves. After education and reemployment, the wealth they create in their new posts will be incalculable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the castle meeting room, Roland ordered the kitchen to be a Margaret A thick soup used to chill, "Drink this, your hands and feet will be warmer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your kindness," the businesswoman picked up a spoonful of Hear, "There seems to be liquor in it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Indeed," he laughed. "In addition to this, there are pepper and honey, and the bottom is Chicken soup.” High-alcohol is a great drink to chill at any time. It is also warmer with chicken soup, which makes the taste more mellow, and the seasonings that cover up the stimulating taste make the whole soup taste fresh and slightly Spicy, people who don't drink often can easily enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margaret slowly breathed out after drinking the soup. "It’s really good. Every time I come to you, I will be full of expectations, I don’t know. What new gadgets you will make, but unfortunately next year I can't possibly visit your territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean trading opportunities?" Roland Sensitively caught the meaning of her words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businesswoman nodded. "Tefco has issued an order prohibiting the trading of saltpeter. Now it is more than the capital of Wangdu, even the saltpeter of Yinguangcheng and Chishuicheng. It is also not allowed to sell, except for the low price supply to the Alchemy Association, it can only be sold to the nobility in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland brows up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
