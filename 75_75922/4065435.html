			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ray of the explosion is fleeting, like the fireworks that appear in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna lifts the lookout and looks at the oasis in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little torches of the stars became the best indicator of the target. The closer to the Iron Sands, the denser the number of torches. Thousands of flaming fires will outline the sand private land, which is also the main target of the artillery battalion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the rumble sound came from the depths of the oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The drop point seems a bit biased," the cat claws who were watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no way, the sand itself is not good for guns, only the first few shots can be used as a test shot." The next shell has been loaded into the cannon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In general, letâ€™s go far, if it falls on the head of the Iron Axe, we are all finished."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, the pub is far from the camp. If this can be hit, the shooting manuals prepared by the sages will have to be rewritten." Rodney pulled the rope, "prepare!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open fire!" Fanna nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two fortress guns once again made a deafening roar, the flames ejected from the muzzle briefly illuminate the ground in front, and the raised dust hit the face On, the people involuntarily squinted their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small oasis in the mouth of the Shamin is not really a town. It is just a camp formed by the clan outside the Iron Sands. No house is made of masonry. Masonry, except for a small number of wood-built low-rise buildings and sentry towers, the vast majority of the rest are tents supported by leather and cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the killing effect of the fortress is so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna noticed that no matter where the shell landed, the surrounding area would instantly darken, but it would soon be lit again - the former was caused by an explosion. The turbulence flipped over the tents and torches, while the latter mixed the torches with flammable building materials to create a more dazzling pillar of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that the First Artillery Battalion used pre-ranging to arrange the strike of the artillery position according to the shooting table. The result is not much ideal. Fortunately, the fragile and flammable goal has made up for this defect. After several rounds of shelling, a large fire has already ignited in the private land of Sha, and several bright fires are spreading outward. With the whistling night wind, it seems to have a tendency to ignite the entire oasis. Although it is impossible to experience the shock of the shelling at close range, Vanner can fully imagine what kind of dilemma this so-called watchdog is currently caught in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unstoppable, inevitable, this is the god of war in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the cannon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the big caliber cannon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smugly squatted in front of the ambushing gun battalion and the machine guns on both sides, once again thanking himself for making the right choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future wars will be dominated by artillery. As for the muskets...but it is used to fill the gap and clean the supporting role of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram spent half a day recovering from the earth-shattering explosion Until now, his ears still creaked, as if they had been slap in the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the Thunder said by the Axe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the deep thunder and sharp whistling, a whistle tower is not far away, a tower is suddenly swallowed by a ball of fire, the whole tower is instantly split! At the same time, the fierce roar of the explosion in his ear made him lose his hearing in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the hole that was pulled out of the wall, many tents were ignited by the smashing smoldering debris and quickly became a pile A bigger bonfire. People screamed out of the fire, fell on the ground and struggled, trying to put out the flames, but only a few lucky people can do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
