			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you find?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Heekzold stepped out of the twisted door, a promotion adjutant asked before welcoming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." It opened the palm of your hand and looked at it. "Probably the eyeliner feels wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a rare situation. You can go to the Dianchi Lake to rest, let the subordinates guard for you." The adjutant paused. "The one...Wakiri is always in the bubble." In the pool, the subordinate thinks...you can relax it occasionally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good advice, it wants to have nothing to do in the pool, close your eyes Feel the mystery and vastness of the conscious world. The problem is that once there is a problem with the West Line plan, the king will not blame the nightmare, but will only pour all the anger on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Heaven is silent, "For you, connecting four eyes at the same time is still too laborious. And now the plan has reached the most critical At the time, it’s better for me to control it personally. This is the last station on the Western Front. We must not disappoint the king again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When referring to Wang, adjutant The look immediately solemnly raised, "You are right! It is subliminal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, only the one who slacks in the pool all day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hekzod said with a blank expression. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Erskuk suffered a human blockade in Tacula, this place has become the focus of the West Line plan, it can be described as dedicated, everything is done. It is a precious eye-protection. Even the swindlers turn down four from the front line to ensure that no matter which direction the enemy comes from, they can be sensed at the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most keen observer, the thousands of eyes of the eye are not limited by size, distance, and light, as long as someone sees it, whether or not it is invisible The state, or the heavy barrier, will be instantly exposed to the consciousness of the eye. The people connected to it can also be immediately aware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this process is extremely labor intensive, it is generally only qualified to be connected to the eye after being promoted. However, this is the case. The world observed by the eyebrows is also very complicated. If it is received in its entirety, it can basically stay in place and nothing can be done. Therefore, the eyebrows will make a preliminary screening in advance, and judge each creature that sees it. Only those targets that are clearly threatened or have abnormal behavior will be submitted to the linker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod felt the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the adjutant said, it’s not uncommon for an eye guard to make a false alarm. After all, the behavior of the creature itself is strange and difficult to understand, like in the group. There are people like the king who are unfathomable, and there are also freaks like fake faces. The eyebrows who lack the ability to think systematically cannot be resolved one by one. In order to accommodate the pile of eyes, they sacrifice too much elsewhere. So that it is magical, for thousands of years, there has never been an eye-guard who was promoted to the Maharaja. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this does not prevent them from being extremely rare in the entire ethnic group, and their larval birth rate is only higher than the incubator and the mother of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After temporarily putting the matter down, the Lord of Heaven changed the subject. "How is the recovery work of the birth tower completed?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The construction part has been closed, and everything is going well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, let me go and see it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sir!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the influence of the stone of God, it cannot be directly Going to the bottom of the valley, you can only go down the long ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the height continues to drop, the surrounding vision becomes scarlet - it is caused by the floating of life in the air, and the towering cliffs make up the natural container As long as you don't stop replenishing, you can easily accumulate it. After half a year of renovation, the concentration of fog in the lower half of the rift is close to the city level, enough for tens of thousands of newborns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
