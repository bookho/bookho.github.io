			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the door on the 76th, isolate the buzz from the pub hall, and then sit back to the opposite of Aegusa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that once she is out of the wolf, the chances of exposure will increase dramatically, but hiding identity is no longer a priority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you would take me to a corner of no one," Aegusa looked at the cubicle. "I didn't expect it to be this." "Places."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pub has always been a good place to exchange information and connect with feelings, adults," she poured a glass of ale on the 76th. "Hope You won't blame me for not being able to provide a more elegant environment for negotiation. After all, I only have two days in the winter city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because no longer worry about revealing identity, pub Obviously, it can reduce the wariness of the other party to a certain extent - it is obviously safer to talk in places where people come and go than in the corners or lanes. Although both of them are not afraid of the cold, but suddenly a stranger emerges, just two words of tongue and mouth want to lead the other side to a more remote place, I am afraid that she will not easily agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the most important point is that she has no hostility to the Winter City or the Witch Alliance, and does not need to take the initiative to put herself in the enemy. The position - before hiding identity is just to find the winner, now there is a better way, she will naturally not follow the original plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortal and the witch are now facing common enemies, and the danger is imminent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you find me in two days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your work The place, the time to return to the castle, the path back to the castle... The first two can be inquired by Wendy's witch, and the latter can be learned from the local people." The 76th succinctly said the process Once again, "I learned that you have become a member of the Alliance, I decided to contact you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that," Ai Gesha gazed Looking at her, "So, is there any other witches in Takira that survived?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be thought of, but we are no longer witches. "On the 76th, I know that the other party is willing to contact her. The only reason is the news of Tacila. Therefore, she did not have any concealment at this point. "The body can't save hundreds of years. We can only use another." One way to continue the compatriots, such as the body you are looking at now, is a god practitioner from the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean...you not only control this body, but also freely inspire the field of stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, this is also the ultimate goal of Akaris adults - a witch and a mortal merge into a warrior who can counter the devil, blood loss will not immediately cause the witch to die, as long as the soul is timely When you transfer to the body, you will get the perfect super soldier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that her plan will not be so simple," Ai Gesha was silent for a long time. Drink the ale in the cup. "But listen to your tone. Other survivors don't seem to agree with this practice? Also... what is your purpose here?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before answering this question, I want to ask you a very important thing first." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you have the Devil, the Battle of God and the Federation? The news, told the witch alliance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventy-six suddenly showed a hint of excitement. "What about them? Do you accept this statement?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not only accepted, but also prepared for the third battle of God," she replied. "In fact, not long ago, the Witch Alliance had handed over the devil and killed one. "The demon and the four fears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventy-sixth can't help but clenched his fists, everything is as she expected, Ai Gesha Sure enough, the news was revealed to the local witches. As a result, the Alliance and Taqila have become natural allies, and she no longer needs to hide her identity, so she can go straight to the point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
