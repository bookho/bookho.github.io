			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Felice said the news, the hall suddenly boiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can mortals contact the gods?" Elsie’s voice was full of shock and disbelief. "You must have read it wrong!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure that the light column was really sent out by him? Have you checked all the witches in the West of Gray Fort?" Serin pointed to the key to the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two questions are clearly the minds of most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have personally confirmed it, and his key is much more complicated than what Pasha asked. The colorful magic stone can no longer accommodate the gabled orange. Light," Felice said slowly. "I didn't believe it at first, but...the truth is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there magic in him?" Pasha asked with the last hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, he can't start the sacred instrument."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice's answer makes everyone The look is one of them, so it is an accident to find a candidate with a complicated key so quickly, but this accident has come too much. No one can expect this to happen - the magic is actually separated from the key, and this discovery simply subverts their previous ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to connect to the core without magic, even if you rely on the witch to transfer - the mortal physique can not withstand the damage caused by this extraordinary power, even extremely strong People can hold on for a quarter or two, and they can't grasp the key points of magic use, which has been fully verified in the Taqila era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what makes Pasha even more worried is that she thought that high-level witches had a good chance of becoming a winner, if the federation ruled the fertile plains. It is easy to find a dozen candidates who meet the conditions. But the news of the return of the Philippine ribbon completely broke the idea - there are more than a dozen high-ranking promoters in the small winter city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amazing amount means that the Witch Alliance is no weaker than some of the core organizations of the Federation, such as the Quest and the Saints, so there is only so much The order exists. Even so, Felice could not find another candidate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Destroy the devil is at your fingertips, just because the ruins are found too late to lead to missed opportunities" and "They actually have not approached the goal at all, the election The plan is to be wishful thinking from beginning to end. The perception of the two is completely different. If so many high-ranking witches are unable to meet the requirements of the chosen ones, then is it true that they follow Nataya’s adults and resolutely resist the Queen’s God’s penalty plan? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought was to make Pasha shudder when she thought about it. She shook her head and pressed the rushing thoughts. Then she asked, "You just said, The mortal king wants to work with us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He wants to know us and is willing to unite against the devil," Felice said, "but specifically The request has to be discussed later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think he has the ability to fight against the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I'm not sure...the weapon he showed is really amazing, but I don't know too much," Felice hesitated for a moment. "But Ai Gesha has some confidence in this. She thinks that she just gives it again. In the absence of the Winter City for two or three years, it is not without a chance to keep the devil in the west of the desolate mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does she think of our relationship with the city without winter city? Ah? Asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ai Gesha thinks she is a Taqila witch, but she will work for Roland Wimbledon, the mortal king." Felice paused and said the idea of ​​the new federation. "She believes that the most important task at present is to defeat the devil. All forces on the mainland should unite and fight for the third battle of God." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you work for mortals? Is she crazy?" Ayr yelled. "Don't she forget that during the first battle of God, we were How did you lose to the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a noisy discussion in the crowd, which was almost all members of the federation, among the mortals. There may be outstanding extraordinary people, but as a whole, its reality is hard to tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
