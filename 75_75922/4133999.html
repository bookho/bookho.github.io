			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now is the turn of spring and summer, how can the forest suddenly burst into flames when the water is fertile? And it seems that there is more than one place! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leaves?" Wendy shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," the leaves seem to have come back to God. "There is beyond the scope of my integration. I can't perceive the specifics of the black smoke." Situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is a fire, you must stop the fire from spreading!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I... I know," the leaves looked a little different, like mixed emotions. She bit her lip and nodded. "No matter what, you should first meet with everyone. After the emergency plan is started, There may be chaos in the camp. It’s not so easy to go there at the time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more workers in the current terminal, and there are still large groups of people who have never been on vacation. It is no easy task for the families of the battlefield to let them complete the evacuation and evacuation in an orderly manner. Wendy soon thought of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...have no problem for one person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, I know what to do Coping." The leaves lowered the terrace, and finally looked at Wendy, then sneaked into the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the harsh alarm sounded over the forest -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, um, I know." In the General Staff Department of Tower 2, Film. Sylter put down the phone and turned to report to Itis. Adults, there are unexpected things happening on the Western Front-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say? The northern part of the forest is suspected of being a fire?" Northland Pearl frowned. "Yes Miss Yeh Observed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the evacuation contingency plan has been launched there, and the first soldiers stationed in the station have also entered the second-level alert state."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notify the general commander, and all relevant senior executives," she said with a decisive indulgence for a while. "It is said that the General Staff Department needs to hold a pre-war meeting."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pre-war conference..." The film repeated, "Do you think this is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not bad," Isis Condensed, "I suspect that the fire is a new trick for the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a quarter of an hour, the First Army General and the Witch Alliance representatives gathered in the ground In the conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the general situation of Beidi Pearl, the latest news was sent to everyone. "Sentinel at the forest terminal has confirmed that the smoke is indeed It is a big fire, and it is affected by the wind, and it is spreading rapidly toward the terminal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a forest fire, no trace of the devil?" Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There has not been a report yet," and the film shook his head. "The smoke blocked the line of sight. No one knows what happened after the line of fire."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Hillway, can you see something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fascinating forest is too far from here Far away," Hillvi replied, "unless... I personally went to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The damn...just chose this time," Iron The axe glanced at the map. "Where is the Queen's Highness now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the original plan, His Royal Highness and some witches will take off and land at the forest terminal The team meets and then returns to the Winter City without the Seagull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be on the black river No. 1 after the return. After receiving the news of the fire, Miss Kant asked me to use the hearing to inform them to change the itinerary." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job," the iron axe sighed a little. "So, what is left there is only the Princess of the Long Princess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After handling the evacuation, the iron axe looked to the staff of the staff. "Now, talk about your views."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves stand at the top of a giant cedar tree, looking at the distant tumbling smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just over an hour, the fire has expanded a lot. Nowadays, not only is the smoke of the sky flying to her, but the smog is already visible under the smoke. Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to hear the crying of the tree when it is burning, although it is not within her control, but the heart of the jungle is still shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that is also the resonance of her own heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of Wendy, she did not say the words, is... afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than a year of annexation and integration, the leaves have gradually touched the essence of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does, in a sense, really make itself an immortal existence - all plants that are incorporated into the heart of the jungle will become her In part, in other words, as long as the area of ​​integration is larger, it is more difficult for her to be eradicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, it’s easy to get rid of a lawn, but if you want to level a forest or the entire grassland, the difficulty will multiply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for letting the world not live, it is almost impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembers that her Majesty said that plants are the foundation of nature, even if the whole world is destroyed, the earth is riddled, the world is reversed, and it first appears on the earth's surface. , will still be this group of tenacious life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that she can no longer count as her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clear springs in the ground, the reptiles in the soil, the vibrating honeycombs on the trunks, the birds singing in the branches... These huge messages are constantly coming from the forest The corner came and was engraved into memory. If it is suddenly accepted, in all likelihood, it will immediately lose its consciousness, which is why the leaves must slow down the speed of integration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she found that even so alone, she could not record so much information on her own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason she has not become a madman so far is that the heart of the jungle has made a choice for her - the numerous intertwined roots and vines make up a huge The consciousness, the magic and the memory merge into one, flowing between the forests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that once the fused forest is destroyed, she will lose some of her memory. Even if the new seedlings grow again in the ruins, the lost things will not come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be her acquaintance with Wendy, the book, or it may be a journey of escape with the nightingale, mystery and Lily; it may be met The gentle scene of Roland's majesty may also be the day and night of life without the winter city... even the stubbornness and prejudice of Hakala, the persecution and pursuit of the church, she does not want to forget. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is her unique experience, it is also proof that she exists in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is afraid of losing them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought of this fire may appear in the confusing forest after the fusion, the heart of the leaves will produce an indescribable sting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she can't go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because all of this is to defeat the devil and win the battle of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can't just throw away the sisters for herself, they are also contributing their own strength, she can't live up to everyone's expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the place, the leaves took a deep breath, raised their hands, and looked up at the sky full of afterglow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
