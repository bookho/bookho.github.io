			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn, Stranglethorn Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This secluded town at the foot of the Cage Mountain has become a lively place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides it is the "outpost" of the Cangshan Command, another major reason is that the Frontline Training Camp of the Air Knight Academy is located here. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to meet the huge expenses of the Air Knight, the engineering team built several spacious hardened cement roads here, connected to the north and south aorta, and directly to the northernmost point of the morning sun. Harbour. The throughput of a large number of resources naturally attracted the attention of the morning merchants. After losing the two trade routes of the wolf heart and the winter, the gray castle became the biggest hope for their profit. Providing services from contracting freight to supplying wine is omnipotent. package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a business opportunity that can bring people to the flow - in just a year, the size of the town has expanded several times. It used to be seen only in big cities. The pubs and hotels have sprung up and spread across the heart of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this change, Tilly, who often travels through the sky, feels the most obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before falling snow, if you look down from the sky, you can clearly distinguish the outline and composition of the town - the most dull color is the Aboriginal house The roof tiles have experienced mottled dark brown and blue-gray after decades of wind and sun. They are small in number and still maintain the original appearance of the thorny town, and on the periphery, the color suddenly becomes various. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are new wooden houses, stone-built bungalows, and even some concrete brick houses. Apparently, after the gray castle passed the calcination technology to the morning sun, some nobles and merchants accepted and began to try to use this new building material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snowfall brought by the evil moon now weakens the difference between the new district and the old district, but it still recognizes the general change of the town from the messy arrangement of the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably Bentham Town has evolved in such a step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sending away the vanilla and breaking the sword, Tilly has devoted herself to the daily teaching--the skyfire type II that has been improved according to her opinion has reached nearly forty With the addition of more than 20 old-fashioned models, the empty knight has become a force to be reckoned with in the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the counterattack of the First Army was so smooth that it was inseparable from the aerial cover of the biplane. Compared with the high-altitude machine guns, the Skyfire has a much greater threat to the beasts, and without effective means of rushing, the artillery can safely use the range advantage to launch a bombardment at the Devil's Outpost and withdraw the position before the enemy is encircled. As long as the high-order devil does not appear, it is difficult for the enemy to approach the first army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a combat mission is performed, dozens of Skyfire will slide over the runway in the form of an elephant walk, taking off at the smallest distance, and the engine roars. Even if you are separated by a small town, you can hear it clearly. Such a spectacular scene is difficult to describe in words, even if the Cavaliers cluster charge is completely incomparable. Anyone who witnesses such a scene will have a new understanding of the power of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene has become a great spectacle of the thorny town, many of the morning monks heard the news, they want to personally verify the legend of the empty knight. Gradually, even on the day of the ordinary drills, the top of the flat building around the landing site will be full of people, watching the silhouette of this group of steel giant birds flying in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly also found out that those with a wide view are charged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the development of the Air Knight Academy is not unimpeded, at least compared to the production of the Skyfire, the problem of the number of drivers being too slow has been revealed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, its recruitment threshold is placed there, not only requires a certain cultural foundation, but also has the physical fitness to adapt to flight, after it is satisfied, it can enter the next step of cultivation. How long does it take to participate in actual combat? The usual practice performance is acceptable, and the students who have been in the chaos of the sky have met several times. In the end, they can only go to the logistics team to do a waste of heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not Skyfire II changed from two-seat to single-seat, temporarily alleviating the problem of driver shortage, the Air Knights are now afraid to have to face There is a dilemma for having an airplane but no one driving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
