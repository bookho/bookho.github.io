			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Luo Jia’s heart sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also knows what her body looks like. When she was in Iron Sands, she never heard of wolf-shaped monsters, half-orcs, gods and the like. statement. At that time, she was the third princess who was the head of the clan. These words were usually only circulated in the back, and no one dared to raise it in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this place is not Tiesha City, she is no longer a fan of the flames, no protection of the clan, she will soon face these harsh words alone It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your ears...and the tail, are they true?" The chieftain said, but he couldn’t hold back. "Do they need magic to maintain, or have they become part of your body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia bites his lip, picks up his hair, and puts an empty cheek on one side Show to the other side - the place that should have been the ear has become flat and smooth, the answer is self-evident. "I can't take them back, kneel down. Although they look weird, they are my real appearance, I don't want to cover up these defects... If you ask, I will try to reduce the exposure to everyone's attention. Time, so as not to scare them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she has made a decision to face herself, at this time, her heart will still have a sense of inferiority. The goddess was originally regarded by the Mo Jin people as the connection between strength and beauty. It is the arrogance of the various tribes, which is almost unanimously sought after by the young warriors. However, she is an exception. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After awakening, no one cares, even the rumors of doubts in the clan, this is why the father is determined to let her take over the position of the patriarch. Luo Jia put all his energy into the combat training. He usually pretends to look like he doesn't care. It can be heard much, and it will always be affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these situations are within her expectation. Since we have chosen the path to go, we should not give up easily regardless of the obstacles encountered. The road to sand that has never been seen in the dream has already pointed her direction. Thinking of this, the wolf woman could not help but straighten her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weird?" The chieftain grinned. "Why do you say that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""? "Luojia, who has been psychologically prepared, can't help but sigh, "not because..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not like the ears of ordinary people?" Roland shrugged. "Ordinary people have no magic yet. Besides, they have no effect on your actions and hearing, and how can they be counted as defects. They can only be regarded as a physical feature at most - and it is still a very interesting feature. You don't think that this Does the double ear look very beautiful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, squat, please pay attention to your words." At the same time, a woman came from behind the other woman. The voice, although pressed very low, was still captured by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Luo Jia’s attention at this time has been completely attracted by the words of the great chiefs, and there is no way to take care of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels that this word can’t be used on her own. I don’t know what to say back. I’m tempted to vent my mind and feel it. There was a hot stream on the cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can a half-human beast be beautiful? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All in all, I won't ask you to cover it up, or go out with a hood as much as possible...you can do what you want." Roland went on to say, "Maybe someone will point at it, but after a long time, they will accept it slowly. It is not bad to let Soroya draw a set of comic strips about you, or join a star flower troupe to perform a drama." Method – After all, becoming an idol is the best way for people to get to know you quickly.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comic strip? Star Flower Troupe? idol? Luo Jia felt that her brain was about to turn around. Apart from staying in the same place, she couldn’t get a word. Fortunately at this time, the other party finally turned the topic back to the original track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, listen to Ashes, are you here to fight against the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf The woman sighed. "At the same time, it is also to temper the skills, kneel down. I heard that there is a witch named Miss Nana Wah in Winter City, which can heal the wounds left in the battle, which is especially important for a warrior. You It should be understood that the ability to accumulate combat experience without any concern is what every warrior dreams of. Of course, I will pay for the treatment in full, in addition to meeting against those strong enemies."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
