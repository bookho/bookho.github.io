			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the exchange rate for these days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third day after the issuance of the new currency, Roland held a ministerial meeting in the castle hall, the main content of which was to discuss feedback on monetary reform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a person, he is very clear that it is not easy to break a tradition that has lasted for thousands of years. Any flaw in one link may lead to an avalanche. If the new currency falls, the trust that the Executive Office... and even his own long-term accumulation will be seriously damaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Less than expected, sire." Barov seems to be more relaxed, "three days of exchange quota less than a thousand gold dragons, considering At the beginning of the New Deal, the turmoil is often the most turbulent, and then the treasury should be able to fully meet the demand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the run, the number of banknotes placed in the first wholesale is equal to the total wages of the month, even if All redemption can also be delayed for two months. But if that happens, it would actually mean that the plan has gone bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you have more thoughts," the boss said with a smile on his beard. "Replacing old coins with new coins is equivalent to losing money, not to a limit. Some of the people will not act rashly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it can't be said that the people accepted the new currency in this way," Agriculture Minister Sene Dali cautiously spoke Tao, "I found that the food sales in the convenience market have been much higher recently, and there are various types of dry goods and spices."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transaction does not fall and increase? Roland groaned and it took a while to react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out to be such a thing, he could not help but laugh, the people really do not want to bear the loss of the fee when the situation is unknown, so replace the safe haven Other necessities - in the past, food is often used as a general equivalent. As for dry goods and seasonings, one of the main features is not that the storage time is long, will it always be used in the future? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have a familiar advertisement in his mind... Paper for food, can’t buy a loss, can’t buy it, what are you waiting for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this also makes Roland feel relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not realistic to let people change their minds in just a few days, but the performance is just to switch to buying goods, the Executive Office has almost no pressure. For example, wheat, eggs and cheese, the output of no winter city is enough to meet the consumption of the entire West. After three months, the treasury will be able to get a new round of sales sharing from the United Chamber of Commerce. At that time, it can be said that the overall situation has been fixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, let them let go," he told Senn. "You must be staring at this time, and there is no sign of a shortage in the market." As long as they do not meet the prescribed personal limit, they want to buy anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goods in the convenience market are all necessities of life, or they can be regarded as state control and Stores that operate must be purchased with an ID card. As long as the businessmen who hold a lot of capital are not involved, the short sale will not happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, squat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, how do other businessmen react?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Back," Barov took the road. "The merchants in the winter city are faintly divided into two factions. The merchants from all over the mainland are still on the sidelines. Many shops have announced that they are closing their doors, do you want to..." He made a gesture of expulsion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't you reject the new currency and simply close the door? Roland shook his head. "The law can't help but the store's rental period has not yet arrived. Whether it is business depends on themselves. What about the other party?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fjord Those big chambers of commerce did not react too much and still operate as usual. However, I received a letter from a number of fjord merchants asking if I can pay for the steam engine and the paddle boat in Singapore dollars. I have given a positive response according to your request. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a whisper in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously everyone is quite surprised by this situation. In their eyes, the domestic dealers actually lost to overseas businessmen in support of the king, it is simply lost. The face of the gray fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the sea people really want to be more active in accepting new things. When the steam engine was launched, it was also the first interest of the flock of Margaret, and it provided the first barrel for the industrial development of Bianbu Town. gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But... there are exceptions here," Barov coughed twice. "A clothing store called Rainbow Stone not only did not go out of business, but instead made banners. Said to be a discount to promote the new currency issue - according to my report, the residents who went to buy clothes are almost full of long streets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Roland blinked and then chuckled... The Victor Loza, who took the initiative to find the door and asked for cooperation with the leaves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the other person be bold enough to really understand their own ideas? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good," he looked at the propaganda minister's honey. "Do a special report on this. At this time, confidence is more important than gold." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Honey nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, my Majesty...Faith is more important than gold." Isis, who has been listening, suddenly said, "Please beware of those rumors that are deliberately fabricated, I think They are coming soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean by this?" Barov frowned. "Is there someone who deliberately wants to be unfavorable to the new currency?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is normal, and those who have a good policy will suffer, such as those who do not want to accept banknotes, or simply want to shake The underdogs of your Majesty... You don’t think that the aristocrats who once made such a fierce squad have only died in two years.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "呃-" The boss always talks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They certainly didn’t, Roland knew that they were only temporarily crouching, and as long as they showed their weakness, the group would still show their fangs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the devil is already under the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, honey and Asha will pay attention to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I - the mining area in the West will never be too few people." The conference hall sounded a cold voice in the air, although no one heard it, but no one would think it was a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looks around everyone, "Listen well, this is just the beginning. After the stabilization period of the first few months, the currency reform will be promoted to the whole country as soon as possible. Completely replace the circulation of Jinlong from the level. This is of great significance for winning the battle of God's will, and you still need to work hard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish!" Everyone is singular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty..." Barov should hesitate after he came down. "After a few months, I have to make so many paper money, can I have time?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The current amount is just enough to replace the salary, it does not mean that its production capacity is only a little, you don't have to worry about this." Roland replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the paper money is just a piece of paper, the technical content is a new peak of no winter city. Considering that the Golden Dragon Silver Wolf accumulated over thousands of years is an extremely large number, he did not consider letting Soroya pick up this burden from the beginning. In terms of paper, the new coin incorporates a certain proportion of rubber worm mucus in the pulp, which has high flexibility after drying and is not easy to tear and break; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The denominations, marked as tin foil, are pre-pressed in place during papermaking – and the technique of making metal tin thin as a flap is only available in winter cities;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The production is printed by a new roller printing machine. The pigments are provided by black clouds and broken swords. The color is both bright and durable. It is much better than the plants and mineral dyes of this era. Enough to support the next round of currency exchange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that whether it is taking into account production efficiency or imitation, the new currency is the best, the witch only supplies raw materials, and the production can be handed over to ordinary people. This is done, which makes it not encounter any thresholds in mass production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
