			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Winter City, North Slope Mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new road connected to the ore yard and the kiln area is undergoing final cleaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different from the iron-clad wood rails in the mine, not only the spacing is larger, but also the bearing surface is much wider. In particular, the two tracks are cast in all steel, and you can imagine how heavy it is. If you change to other lords, you will feel incredible for such a waste - how many sets of armor and swords are so many irons? Even a conservative estimate is enough to arm a large-scale Knights. Now it is buried in the ground, letting it wind and rain, rust and dust, is simply a practice of losing the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland walked into the yard with the participants, there was a commotion in the crowd. Not every department knows the ins and outs of the new roads, especially the officials from the Changge District. They are even more surprised to open their mouths, and their eyes can no longer be removed from the track that is lined up – they are inherently uniform. The railroads always give people a kind of silent power, and even if they don't understand its role, they will be convinced by this power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several years of "shocking tempering", they would not think that their king would be a loser, but this practice still makes most participants stunned. . Spreading the cast steel strips on the ground, it seems that there is no difference between paving with Jinlong paving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a good material, as long as it is shipped out, you can exchange a lot of coins in any city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, only the winter city can afford such consumption. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the blast furnace ironmaking and converter steelmaking were put into formal production, the cornerstone of all industries, steel smelting, finally achieved a certain degree of “witching off”. Although the latter needs Anna to "ignite" to start, but this initial production process is a miracle in this era compared to the original "Steel Star." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the transformation of the North Slope Mine has further enhanced the smelting industry. Under the bold planning of the Ministry of Construction and the cooperation of the lotus, several blasting operations blasted the dome of the shallow mine, which turned some mining areas into open-pit mines, while iron ore was the largest mining area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is from the beginning of the previous year that the steel output of No Winter City has achieved a leap in breakthrough, the total amount of steel released in one month compared to other cities in the Grey Fort. Add up more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only in Roland’s view that this is a matter of course – if industrial production can’t crush the “steel” that the blacksmith has tempered, he toss these Things don't make sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the current track, it is part of the experimental railway that connects the mining area, the smelting area and the dock in the original design. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no significant difference between the wide rail and the narrow rail in the consumables and load capacity, he deliberately adopted one meter five as the railway spacing standard, the number is easy to remember, The width of the two track plus roadbeds is also basically within the range of the ability of the lotus. The sleepers are cut from logs, and the meteorites are taken from the slag after the mine blasting. If you don't look at the carrying vehicles, these rails are exactly the same as the modern tracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But later, with the opening of the united war, the construction work was temporarily interrupted. After all, what he wants to do is still in the experimental stage. It is impossible to build a factory without setting it up. Therefore, whether it is rail processing or installation, it is done by Anna. Without a black fire, the road in the latter half is naturally impossible to talk about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, these new roads are not enough to satisfy the curiosity of the people. Under Roland’s instructions, the workers unveiled a canvas shed at the end of the track. When the canvas covered with dust and fallen leaves landed, a dark steel car appeared in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, this is... steam wheeler?" Peregrine District Chief Executive Pei Luo surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that he would think that as the main part of the vehicle, the barrel-shaped steam engine standing on the steel beam immediately attracted everyone’s attention. As more and more steam engines are put into use in winter towns, officials are becoming familiar with this seemingly clumsy, yet infinitely powerful machine, even in traditional areas that require a lot of manpower to complete. Steam engines are also actively considered to achieve goals – such as farm irrigation, dock unloading, and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
