			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Sylvie has confirmed that there are no other devils around."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If the enemy launches an attack at this distance, we have at least five minutes of reaction time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Five minutes enough high-altitude machine gun team is ready. Threat judgment? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The high-order devil is not found in the known enemy, and the threat to His Royal Highness is almost zero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the construction is carried out as usual, the biggest loss may come from a rail-transporting group with dense crowds and inconvenient evacuation. The casualties are expected to be one or two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The command post was busy in a group. After analyzing intelligence and repeated discussions, a series of conclusions were listed on the display board. This is a habit gradually developed by the staff of the staff. In the face of complicated information, words are more difficult than language. be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In summary," Flint Hillvi raised his chest toward the iron axe. "We believe that the benefits of continuing construction are greater than the original defense, which may be It will make the devil understand our intentions, but this is within Roland's plan. As for the four flying devils, just keep the minimum mark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In short, all the intelligence combined to draw the conclusion is "not afraid of threats." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the role of the staff is only to assist in the analysis and to provide advice, the final decision is still to be self-contained, but this conclusion coincides with his ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Army was not the ancient army four hundred years ago, even the 5,000-strong vanguard was enough to claim a behemoth, relying on four It’s impossible for a madman to incite their squad, and to exchange the casualties of one or two hires for the annihilation of the other, and even for his plan, he can’t even lose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the risk of coming to the wild has long been written into the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe looks to Isis, and the latter does not say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the command post, silence means default. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, let the construction team resume operations, the high-altitude machine gun team continues to be in the field, others are on standby." When the adjutant gave the order, Itis suddenly spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not facing him, but toward Aisha and Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a way to shoot those flies directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Say... take the initiative?" Ai Gesha frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I always feel that it is not a good thing to keep them staring." Northland Pearl nodded. "As far as I know, the two will fly." The little girls all have good combat ability, right? With the cooperation of Miss Chen, maybe they can kill them all. It is beyond the scope of the First Army, and only you can do it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Ai Gesha hesitated. "In theory, there are only two devils, and their attack is not risky. Otherwise the enemy will Initiating a spear, it is difficult to get out of close range. Even if Andrea is the first player, there are still three left..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more she talks, the slower she is Because even she herself felt that the rhetoric was rather stubborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is a war, there can be no risk, not to mention that this is a battle to determine the fate of the front of the community. In order to get a chance, thousands of witches died under the devil's butcher's knife, and lightning is no more special than others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the truth is that after entering the fertile plains, she perceives the other side’s strangeness – despite the hidden force of the flashing electrode, Aegis’s who have experienced the battle of divine This state is no stranger, it is the confusion caused by encountering unimaginable strong enemy. It is precisely because of the power of the enemy that an illusion that it is impossible to overcome, so many war-torn sacred Witches are not spared. If you want to adjust it, apart from the means of drugs and abilities, you can only recover by yourself. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
