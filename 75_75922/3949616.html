			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to appease the uneasy feelings of the nobles, Roland specially arranged a rich banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long table with white cloth in the center of the hall. The aristocrats who come to sit in the opposite direction, in the middle are various dishes, wine and flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two glasses of red wine, the atmosphere eased a lot, plus the big nobility has all fallen, honeysuckle and elk are standing on the side of Roland, the rest of the small The nobility will not jump out to sing the opposites at this time, but instead express their intention to take the initiative. In this situation, Roland knows that it is time to put his newly established order on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a full meal, he distributed the small book prepared in advance to the nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is his "propaganda album". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness... What is this," Sure enough, the nobles soon asked in amazement, "Why is the painting above so realistic?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s just like real."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not like drawing ... no pigment can express such delicate colors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No loss is a nobleman in a big city, you can see that these people have certain paintings. Appreciation ability, Roland smiled and said, "They are indeed painted by the artist, but to say that there is something different, that is, the artist is a witch, and the paint she paints is the omnipresent magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words make everyone's body a stiff, the book in the hand is not, not letting it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The local church forces have vanished, what are you worried about?" The prince raised a brow. "The witch is no different from us. I have verified too much. "The second time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough...cough," Pedro almost stunned. "His Highness is right."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No loss is the four princes, haha...ha," the other nobles laughed awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃, it seems that he said a rather ambiguous word, Roland pretended to be nothing, changed the subject - for more than a year as a prince, he found himself The level of change is not astounding...or the thickness of the skin is leaps and bounds. "The picture is just to make the content more vivid. The story described above is the key point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people continue to turn After reading a few pages, O'Reilly, the little girl from the elk family, quickly raised her head. "Is this a family history of a noble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ory Lean!” Ryan whispered his voice and reminded him, “Call your Highness!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes, he used to be a Western aristocrat,” Roland did. Gesture, "You should someone remember him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness... I know him," said a knight, "Tiguen Pine, he is My neighbor, the territory of the two of us has been put together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen him," another person Recalling, "It seems to be a baron. His father is the vassal of Joey Cole. Since Joey left the West, his territory has declined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Viscount is currently in the town of Bianque," Roland smiled. "And this album records the passages I and his understanding... and what happened later. As you can see, he is a The aristocrats living under the new system are currently busy practicing muskets. It is estimated that by the end of the evil month, he will bring his daughter and attendant to the fascinating forest to enjoy the hunting fun. As far as I know, since he After selling the territory east of the fortress and rest assured that it was settled in Bianbu Town, it was not allowed to advance to the first level, and the family property has increased several times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear comes from Unknown, the same is true of the resistance to institutional changes, because they do not know what impact they will have on themselves after the change. Roland asked Soroya to portray the life of Tigou Pine in the form of a comic book. As an example of his own propaganda, it was to reduce the resistance and fear of the nobility. Compared to those boring textual biographies, it is clear that the expressive power of comics is more vivid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
