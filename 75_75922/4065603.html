			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night is not a time to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil moon can't see the sun, nor can you see the moon, the faint cold light is sprinkled on the undulating desert, and the side that faces the light source can still I vaguely see the outline, and when I am facing it, I can’t reach my fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, whether it is offensive or defensive, the torch is essential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the scattered fire appeared in the oasis direction, Danny carefully wiped a magazine, then inserted the loading port and pulled the bolt up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy is coming, pay attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can see."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first imitated the sound of malt, and then replied to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing so, it’s as if malt is still by his side, acting as a protector and continuing to fight alongside him – even though he is no longer accurate A member of the shooting team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the execution of the confinement, Danny returned to the gun camp, but Brian quickly found him and brought him a brand new The musket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the one he is holding in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it looks no different from the bolts used by the precision shooting team, Danny realized that the gun was a great thing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a sword with similar shapes. Some are just a hand-made work that the blacksmith knocks out, and some are swords that can blow the hair. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The metal part of the gun body exudes a unique radiance, the surface is smooth with the skin of the girl; any interface is flat like a knife axe Engraved, touched as if it was natural, without a hint of a thorny hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Danny most was that it had an extra single-tube gaze on top of it, with two straight lines intersecting the mirror. The center of the thin line is where the bullets fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sure how this is achieved, but through the lookout mirror, the original blurry and small distance target is instantly clearer, in a sense Equal to extending the range of the gun. And the subsequent test training also proved his feelings - this new gun has a higher shooting accuracy than the general bolt gun, in the absence of wind or breeze, the humanoid target within 500 meters, he hit The grasp of the head is as high as 90%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning that the weapon was built for him, Danny was almost moved to tears on the spot. Although he committed a disciplinary mistake, His Majesty still did not give up on him, and gave him the right to freely choose the location of the shot in the position. This kind of treatment has nothing to do with his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only when Brian asked if he wanted to choose a protector, Danny refused without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He already has his own protector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and malt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more fires in the field of vision, like the stars reflected in the sand sea - as early as the conductor expected. Before each battle, the superiors will detail the battle intentions and combat objectives to each team, let them know how far the next battle will be played. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the bonfires on the artillery positions and the speed of shooting at half an hour are all designed to induce the enemy to counterattack, thus weakening the watchdog as much as possible. The clan's combatants prepare for the general attack after dawn. The brightly lit position allows the enemy to notice the stranger. Controlling the firing frequency is to avoid the rapid and violent bombardment directly breaking the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Danny knew that the artillery battalion could not do the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look at the person's face all day long, but they don't know how much resources they have. The weapons and ammunition carried by the firearms can be carried by the soldiers alone, but the artillery battalion? Without the help of the witch named Hummingbird, even the guys who even eat can't move into the desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
