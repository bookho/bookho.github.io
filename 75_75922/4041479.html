			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation of the morning king of the capital is somewhat floating, and even the covenant who is not too concerned about political affairs can feel it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the new king is enthroned, the street can see the guards rushing into the residential houses every day. The most often talked about in the pub is the border lord. In the rebellion, the foreign goods at the exhibition were much less, and even the caravans under his name temporarily suspended slave transportation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen Hill said that Anpein Moya not only kept the slaves of the wolf heart, but also gave them the status of free people - this is a The good deeds hindered Roland’s plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no opinion on this appointment. The caravan is provided to him by Dennis. The slave fee is not a business. It is a bit of a profit. No, it’s not heartbreaking. As long as he is still the ash ambassador, such benefits will always come to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alliance has made new progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third day after the reign of Anpein, he was recruited into the palace and answered the new Wang’s detailed inquiry about the covenant. After the news that the church suffered a fiasco in the cold winds passed to the king, Anpein even happily pressed his handprint on the covenant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the official completion of the first task of His Majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that night, Hill poured a cold water on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This covenant is coming too late, I am afraid it has no effect." He remembered that the guards said at the time, "and the attitude of the new king to the witch is very likely." The resentment that caused the underarms, the last such a dry Feike is to prove that this parchment you still have to be a memorial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland. It’s a well-known thing about the value of witches, but it’s because the witches and their neighbors are tearing up the covenant? Joel only felt that the other party was alarmist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, how the main reason for managing the kingdom is his freedom, and even if he is disgusted, the Moya family has been the ruler of the Dawn Kingdom for generations. Others simply can't intervene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he is still on the side of his old friend - the witch is so beautiful and outstanding, how can it look like the devil's minions? . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe shook his head and threw these chores behind him. He was just an ambassador. He honestly conveyed his intentions. As for the situation and political changes, It has nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead of time, he plans to go to see Denise first, and then decide on the entertainment this evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just getting ready to go, the eldest son of Losey’s family suddenly came to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the dark road is not good, this guy has never brought good news, the previous letter claims to be related to the survival of the gray castle, and later said that the new king and If you are a child, if you have two people, every intelligence will be a headache. If Hill does not insist on maintaining this relationship, he really wants to turn a blind eye to Otto Locy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time he called Hill to sit in the town, he ushered the other side into the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have news in the palace to tell you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not available yet," Otto was very familiar with pouring a cup of tea. "Do you have an arrangement at night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Actually not yet, but about hope The other side will retreat, Denise will take him to enjoy the wind and snow, and Otto will only let him sleep all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's off, I want you to do me a favor," he handed a black letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the opening, I found out that it was an invitation, and the collection was a dark faucet, exactly the same as the one printed on the Golden Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head after reading. "Do you want me to accompany you to the show? I don't have the money to help you bid."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
