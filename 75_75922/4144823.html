			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy... actually speaks people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the count was helped by the escort, he only felt that his face was hot and his face was quite ugly - he intended to show his prestige in front of his hand, and also to other nobles. Confidence in confidence, but I was shocked to be intimidated by a snoring, and even more unfortunate is that the other party has only one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, I am going to kill this git! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien raised his hand with a grin and was waiting for the order to be fired. The old bachelor suddenly took hold of him and slammed his eyes and spit out the words. --"calm". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count stunned for a moment and then reacted. Indeed, since the other party can speak, there is a possibility of communication. If you can communicate, it means trading and negotiation. The situation is still unclear, and there is really no need to get ahead of it. Suddenly, he was still influenced by the Grey Fortress, and he first became the enemy of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think carefully, whether it is a devil or not, being alone may mean an attitude, just like a human ambassador. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, why did it not move, but chose a place that looked at the city wall and stood still? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other party is as cruel and violent as the Gray Fort said, it should have been smothered beforehand - there are no ice gaps in the surrounding villages and towns. City wall protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien thinks more and more, if he kills the messenger, first hate the so-called "devil", isn’t it the meaning of the gray-great people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just now vowed to ask each other to kneel down and obey themselves, but now they have to communicate with each other equally, this face count is really difficult to pull down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the old scholar saw his hesitation and took the initiative to say, "It’s really rude! Since you know what people say, you should start by saying Identity and intentions! Fortunately, the Lord is merciful, willing to give you a chance to start again - what are you doing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good work, Ma Weien Congratulations, it is worthy of the management that was dug from the king. The salary of the ten Golden Dragons was not given. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before, I want to ask you one thing first," the devil's voice returned to its normal size. "You are with the humans on the fertile plains... What relationship?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodland? where is that? A group of people, look at me, I look at you, the face is inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this also gives Ma Weien the bottom - this monster is really a messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know where you are referring to the fertile plains," the old scholar said again. "It’s like the same piece of land. The northerners call the South and South. It’s the same in the north. It’s still the same in a kingdom, not to mention you and me. Only by taking the map, can I give you an accurate answer.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the name of your human beings. I just used it." The other party shook his head slightly. "It turned out to be the case... You are still standing like a city, just like a few hundred years ago, like a sand, so the reaction It will be so slow. I am still looking forward to your disappointment and horror, while shouting that this is impossible, but there is nothing to do with the arrival of "destiny". "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? The word is the same as acting... The count can't help but frown, there is a moment, he seems to be weird from the other side There was a trace of disappointment on the face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s hard... you mean the Grey Fortress? The chief knight suddenly asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm? "The devil looks at him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have been saying that the devil will appear from hell when the red moon comes. Now they are indeed scared to escape, and they have long since ran away. The Cavaliers disdain, "Of course, if your footsteps are fast enough, you may still see them on the east side of the harbor." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the Lord of Scorpio, the commander of the Western Front Army. Before thousands of years ago, you and my two people signed a refuge contract to fight against the witches and their envy. You are mainly my family, under the command of me. Combat, the rewards are the power and wealth that governs the human territory. This contract does not end the time, and the death will not end - and you, as the inheritor of mankind, should continue to work for our people." The voice of the devil Once again, it became very bright, as if the whole city could hear its voice. "Now, I ask you to offer this city in accordance with the contract and immediately serve me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This guy is afraid of not being crazy... Earl Ma Weien was stunned, what a thousand-year contract, a contract of one or two years can be deny, who cares about you thousands of years ago. Also the Western Army commander, which lord did not send messengers to talk first, solitary people ran to his city to swear words, there must be a limit to the nonsense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I don't agree?" The remarks were too rude, and he was really intolerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death will make you succumb." The devil who claimed to be the Lord of Scorpio looked up. "Look, that is fate."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count raised his head and saw the mountains in the distance. I don’t know when there was a mist. It is not uncommon to see fog on the desolate mountains, but the fog is like blood, and the red is so frustrating. He didn't know if it was the illusion of the red moon, or the fog itself was colored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another weird thing is that the red fog that crosses the cliff does not float in the air, but slowly falls from the peaks, forming a 朦胧"Waterfall". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn’t it move before, just to wait for this opportunity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien vaguely felt a little uneasy, looking at a nervous, whispering man, he knew that no matter what, the heart would not be stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On your own?" The count bit his teeth and slammed his hand. "I have given you a chance, let the arrow!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers and the guards slammed into the air and suddenly slammed the trigger and the crowbar, and more than ten different arrows of different sizes vacated. Going straight toward the devil -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but all the arrows are empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They almost couldn’t believe what happened in front of them, only to see it pass through a black hollow and disappear into the pillars out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, that's the magic effect," said the chief knight. "They are no different from witches!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be afraid, we all wear the stone of God's punishment, the magic can't hurt us!" Ma Weien clenched his chest, "find it, then kill it!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil, the devil is there!" shouted a bodyguard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, it has crossed the barriers formed by the ice and the walls, and quietly appeared in the long street behind the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a step over the natural danger, and the count suddenly sounded the alarm. Such a dangerous monster, whether it is a messenger or not, it has to die here - after all There is only one person. "Prepare the arrow of the god stone and treat it as a witch! The person who killed it, the bounty of the dragon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just in the direction of the knight and the guard from all directions When the rush came, the devil slowly raised his arms--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, a "black curtain" with a few tens of feet wide appeared behind it. The street and the houses on both sides were cut off, and it seemed as if there was a wall with no thickness on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does it want to do? The count can't help but have some doubts. It's neither an attack nor a defense. Is it going to hide itself with this ability? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon he got the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick red mist spurted out of the darkness, like a river bank! Then a group of unseen monsters screamed and rushed out of the dark curtain, colliding with the knights around them - the god stone did not cause any influence, the knight's mouth spit blood was hit and flew out, the chest was hollowed down. Seeing that it is impossible to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
