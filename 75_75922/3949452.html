			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training venue for pistol shooting is arranged in the vestibule of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the witches selected for the scouting team, including Sylvie, received a revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royal Orchid After two days to familiarize and master the gun posture, the training entered the live-fire shooting. The main content is divided into ten-meter aiming shooting and five-meter fast shooting to cope with both the enemy and the sudden attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the practice of the guns, the witches performed in a different way, and when they were shot, they showed the stuffing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when the deafening gunshots sounded, the first thing most people did was to plug their ears and watch the night brows straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw her holding the gun and motionless, continuously pulling the trigger, completely ignoring the gunshots and smoke. Regardless of the head, the action is done neatly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to learning knowledge, Anna is equally talented in other areas? Roland was secretly surprised, but as a large-caliber revolver, even with black gunpowder bullets, there is a strong recoil, why her arms can not move in continuous shooting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He curiously walked behind the other side, only to see two black fires clinging to the grip, holding it firmly in the air, and Anna just made In the virtual grip position, there was no pistol at all. After taking a picture of her shoulder, she took out the black fire as an earplug from her ear and looked at the expression of "Come on me." "How, I shot all the targets!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was crying and laughing, and he had to announce aloud: "Everyone should not use the ability to assist in practice!". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you encounter an enemy with a stone of divine punishment, "Don't you be in a hurry?" Roland sighed and reached out to help Anna plug his ears. "This is always not afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm!" The swaying eyes were full of smiles, and after changing the bullets, the guns were re-targeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mc茜, come on, I also need to plug my ears," Lightning enviously muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕?" The latter refers to the gun in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After you become a bird, you can’t open a gun anyway," the little girl gave a wink. "You help me block it first. I will help you later." You block."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other witches in the castle are also being continuously The gunshots were attracted and gradually gathered in the vestibule of the castle. Many people also showed their eagerness to try. In the end, almost everyone came up to experience the operation of the heat weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the eyes of a group of colorful women who are fiercely fiddling with the weapons in their hands, Roland feels in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now he still remembers the appearance of each witch when he first met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny’s previous hands and feet were as thin as a bamboo pole, and there was no life in her eyes, and her face was always an expression;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale’s eyebrows always have a cloud of darkness, and the smile has nothing to do with emotions, or it is just to cover up their emotions, and always smiles in the corners of the mouth;<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tiredness that Wendy can't conceal after soft whispers, the leaves will be the fate of the future and the confusion, like a cat full of alert Lily;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lightning, mystery, hummingbirds, books, etc...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After experiencing oppression, framing and hunting It is a kind of luck to survive. As for where you will go, there is no time to think. Now, they are completely different from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I saw the gratitude and trust that the witches and their own eyes showed, Roland felt full of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having lunch, in the afternoon it was his turn to make a special "fall offensive" The high-altitude throwing practice, the number of witches participating in the drill reduced by half, leaving only Anna, Wendy and lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the minimum number of people required to complete an air raid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting the attack time in the early second month of the fall is the result of Roland’s deliberation. If the time is too short, you can’t prepare for it; too late, I am afraid that it will not be able to deter Tefko from sending troops. As long as he insists on launching a large-scale attack on the West and feeding the drugs to the civilians who have been forced to do so, the air strike will not achieve the intended effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fall offensive must be launched before he has completed the call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to realize his "promise", Roland plans to cast a 250-million-level bomb directly above the Royal Castle. This bomb, which is equivalent to the weight of five nightingales, will be cast from a height of 2,000 meters, directly across the dome of the palace, and detonated inside the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the hot air balloon slowly ascending, the huge basket is carried by a solid simulation bomb and lifted up into the sky - since Roland is also riding in the basket, this A solid iron bullet should be smaller than the first one, and it is only about four nights. However, its shape is exactly the same as that of the actual aviation bombs in the future. It adopts a thick and streamlined outer casing with a stable tail and a parachute at the end to ensure that it is always perpendicular to the ground and controls its maximum speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throwing basket has also been specially modified to erect an iron bracket so that the bomb stands vertically in the center of the basket and half out of the bottom of the basket. As long as the valve is pulled up and the hook mechanism is released, the bomb will leave the basket and fall straight down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the height continues to rise, Bianbu Town will soon have only one piece of nail size, and the Chishui River turns into a silver ribbon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was standing in such a high place for the first time," Wendy looked out through the lookout window. "I feel that the entire western environment has become narrow." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is very small," Roland chuckled. "Look at the wild land in the north, where is where we should go." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will you go up again? I can't see the target point," Lightning shouted outside the basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s almost like this," he nodded toward Anna, and then compared the little girl to a prepared gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is impossible to judge how far away from the ground at this time, there is always more than a thousand meters - it is absolutely safe to launch an attack at this height. And the enemy can't observe the movement of the hot air balloon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the airdrop distance of more than a thousand meters means that the hit depends entirely on the fate. To accurately hit the target, the bomb must have a guidance system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the little girl lightning will take on this task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bombing," Roland ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter pulled the valve, dropped the bomb, and the air flow suddenly poured into the basket. Anna sealed the throwing holes in the prepared cover and tightened the brackets – these procedures were repeated on the land, and the two seemed to be very accommodating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can she hit the target?" Wendy asked at the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has to wait for us to know the answer," Roland shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of a bomb falling, lightning will fall at the same speed as it, and a horizontal thrust will be applied to it so that the bomb can freely change its trajectory and become a A missile with guidance capability. When it is approaching the target, the tail mechanism is pulled by lightning to separate the deceleration from the projectile. The bomb will gain sufficient kinetic energy within the last few hundred meters until it passes through the court roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
