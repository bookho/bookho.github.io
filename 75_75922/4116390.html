			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two weeks of execution of the counterattack program named "Peace of the Peak", Roland received a report from the frontline detection lightning - the first army battalion successfully completed The first step of the plan was to break the "Sen 2 + 1.76" breakpoint of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The naming of the breakpoint applies the railway mileage identification method, the first half is the planned regional site, and the second half is the corrected distance. In other words, the breakpoint is located at the No. 2 station of Forest Track and then one kilometer and seven hundred and sixty meters away. The advantage of this identification is that Roland can accurately see the trajectory of the army from the big map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also the end of the current orbital extension. From here on, the first army will move to the second step of combat - leaving the lost forest, without leaf cover In the case, walk to the northeast of the wilderness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you destroy the devil's outpost, and see if this step can go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the fortress and machine gun positions are put up, the rhythm of the war can return to the most familiar mode of the First Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know," Roland made a heavy stroke at the breakpoint. "Devil, do they react?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the answer from Shasha, "Silvi said that there is no time, they are still concentrating on building their own outposts, and several black stone columns have been set up. There is a "red line" behind it, and the staff judges that the number of long-legged big guys is also limited. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is good news, Ai Gesha once said that the only thing that restricts the devil from destroying and destroying human beings is the red fog, if it is the third time If they have tried to break through this limitation, it will be a bad news for everyone. Nothing else, just the mobility of the beast beyond the times, coupled with the amazing combat power of the high-level devils, the long border of the four kingdoms It’s no different from an undefended sieve.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland now knows that the stone pillars in the outpost and the legendary Blackrock Spire are not a thing, although they have many Commonplace. The former can store red fog and slowly release it to form a special fog environment for the devil to absorb. In this environment, the devil's function and self-healing ability will be improved, and the simple understanding is the home game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone column has an increasing effect, which can treat one red mist as two, but it will eventually consume reserves. The Blackrock Tower can generate red fog by itself. Coverage is much broader Basically the core of the devil city.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other stone pillars are not shipped and can be used. The information of the ancient witches shows that they have the difference between death and living, generally It can only be secreted for about a month before it can be secreted. Before that, it can only be used as an enlarged version of the red fog tank.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi's observation As a result, he made a little more control. No one wants his opponent to rush home after two days of injury. He can be rushed again and again, and there is a bunch of reinforcements behind his butt. According to the current construction speed, An army should be able to launch an attack before the revitalization of Shizhu.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, you will continue to investigate, and inform me of new circumstances. Remember to put safety first whenever possible. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning understands. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was then the light of the printed seals extinguished.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland picked up a ruler, Compare on the map - if there is no accident, the first army will enter the devil's investigation circle after six days, that is, the season autumn.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For people who are used to fighting on land, this will be a formidable challenge.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, you are not at ease? "The nightingale received a good sign," "Is the test results of the new weapon not quite good?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that is testing, after all, what will happen in the war, no one knows before the experience." Roland said, "When Sylvie puts his attention all over the sky, the First Army can only be armed on its own." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The balloon that flutters in the wind five kilometers away can make a hit every time. This is incredible, and Andrea will not let it down." Weapons. "The nightingale smiled. "As for Hill's lack of vigilance, there are lightning and wheat, did the first army not always come this way?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
