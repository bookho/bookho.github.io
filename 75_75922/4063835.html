			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this problem, Roland first groaned, then could not help but raise his mouth. "Do you seem to have other words to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it is related to the survival of all people, we hope that every decision can be fully considered, so... Tachela proposes a joint governance system." Pasha replied, " In the united front, the directives are jointly negotiated by the heads of the most powerful groups, which can effectively avoid wrong judgments and ensure the interests of all parties."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh... it sounds like the three-seat system of the federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three is a suitable number that can be used in decision-making speed and uniformity. A good balance is achieved. Of course, considering the four kingdoms of today, plus the witch organization, it is not necessary to use three seats to make decisions. For example, in the early days of the federation, it was formulated by a round table of eleven leaders. The battle plan." The ancient witch explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly a clever consideration, Roland thought, except for the one without the winter city, the rest is the human kingdom, the witch alliance and the sleeping island. In terms of strength, it is impossible to form an advantage for the Tacula survivors. The more than one hundred perfect puppets seem to have few, and in the face of ordinary troops and witches, their combat power is almost overwhelming. In addition, they have been fighting the devil for several decades. It is rich in practical experience and inherits the magical relics of underground civilization. It is a force that cannot be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you arrange seats according to your strength, they will certainly be able to occupy a seat at the decision-making level, and then just keep in touch with other witch organizations to strengthen that natural identity, ie It can ensure the interests of Tacula itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may not have made more plans, such as regaining the dominant position of the witch, or reversing with the human kingdom, just a cautious self-protection Behavior - This is almost the appeal of any organization before it joins a large group. Roland, who was replaced by the first arrival, may agree, but he is no longer the one who just took over the lord, but only the four princes of a small Bianbu town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An interesting proposal, but the united front will not implement a system of co-governance. Its leader will only have one person, that is me." Roland is not allowed The tone of defense said, "This is the most efficient and stable way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-humility is a virtue, but now it is definitely not a time of humility - - The three-seat rule is probably a good choice for the Federation, but it is not the case for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, only he understands what is needed for industrialization, and what can be done to realize the maximum potential of the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to build this framework, all departments must become a unified machine, a qualified screw. Orders from the City Hall must be sent unimpeded to every leader, and resources need to be coordinated. If all policies have to explain to other seats or convince those who have lost their interests, industrialization will not be able to make big strides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably his rejection was too direct, and the scene became silent for a moment, even the ancient witches were stunned, and for a long time did not pick up a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland cleared his throat and went on in an orderly manner. "The united front is indeed a guarantee against the devil, but I did not ask you to join in from the beginning. To the West is just the foundation for building trust. I hope that you can see it with your own oral agreement..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See...What?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The strength and determination of the winter city against the devil, and the organizations that join us or do not join us, their interests and status quo. On the basis of full understanding "You can make free choices," he said frankly. "Even if we can't make up our minds, we can also carry out the most basic cooperation, such as finding the best candidates, providing experimental items for a fee, etc., but not interfering in policy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if we don't give the core of the relics and magic to you?" Catherine interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same," Roland nodded. "In fact, I never intended to defeat the devil by the things in the ruins. As for the relics of the gods, just put it on both sides." I can accept the place where it can be safe. As I said before - looking for the winner and ensuring the safety of the relic, this is the most basic trust. As for other things, we can cultivate slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
