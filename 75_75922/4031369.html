			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunboat slowly docked at the dockside, and Roland walked out of the cabin and couldn’t help but be seen The scenery is attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curved mountain rock sticks out from both sides, like a pair of giant hands, wraps the whole town, looks up, the sky is only five fingers wide One line, the sun shone from the gap, like a golden wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless vine plants falling down from the bottom of the rock, like green silk, some thick rattan even falling to the ground, people can't help but want to follow It climbed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light penetrates the dense branches and leaves a little spot on the flowing river, Roland feels like he is in the jungle that is not yet open. . However, this place is not without people. Under the silent river, all kinds of artificial buildings extend to both sides. The townspeople shuttle in and out of the broad-leaved broad-leaved clumps. The smoke rises slowly and there is an indescribable harmony. beauty of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the light, the temperature here is a few degrees lower than the outside, and the color of the plants is also rich and rich. It is not difficult to understand the name of the valley town. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland and the witches set foot on the moss-covered pier, a group of people have long been waiting here, for the three natural leaders of the first army, Axe, North Duke Calvin and his daughter Isis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We met again, Your Majesty," said Itis, bowing his knees, "Congratulations on winning the battle."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have heard the report when I was on the boat, and did a good job," Roland nodded with approval. "Listen to the iron axe and say that you have guaranteed sufficient food supply and ammunition transportation to lure the enemy. The work is also in place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what Kant’s family should do," she said with a smile. "Northern businessmen are very happy to help you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, six months ago, the owner here was Tiffco Wimbledon, and Roland thought that the businessmen would not even hear their names. The so-called willingness to serve should also be the means of Itis - to drive the traders of the three cities to complete the plan, and her control over the North is indeed extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He encouraged a while and looked at the iron axe. "Is the battle result counted?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty," Iron Axe marching ceremony, "The specific report has been placed in your office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Office... room ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have negotiated with Earl of Haier. When you stay in Glentown, his castle is your palace." Addis added, " In addition, I have already rectified the study. I re-arranged it according to the layout of the Bianbu District, and knocked out a sunny wall to install the floor-to-ceiling windows. I heard Miss Mai said that you like the transparent room."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it?" Roland asked with great interest, "What about the Count?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order not to interfere Your job, he will stay in the mansion in the suburbs." Northland Pearl Dunton, "Do you need me to call him to see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, If he doesn't like ginseng The words of these political affairs," he waved. "Let's go to the castle first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, please come with me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the taste of power? Roland pouted, and it was quite good to experience it occasionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the converted study, he thought he had returned to no winter In the city, even the spacious mahogany table and the recliner of the coffee table in the corner of the room were re-enacted. The only striking difference is the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows, one is a gray and desperate mountain, and the other is a quiet valley covered by green leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how the original owner, Earl Haier, would feel after leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
