			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news of the successful completion of the rescue operation, Roland finally rest assured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the deviation from the original plan, it was not possible to sweep the morning with the conqueror’s face, but the neighboring countries eventually overthrew the rule of the Moya family. And maintained basic stability. The new Quin family will be the most loyal ally of the Grey Fortress before they stand firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention that there is still an Alexandria on the side of Wintertown. As long as there is no accident, the alliance with the morning buddies is enough to sustain this generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not believe that the third war of gods will last for a hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia and the expedition’s goddess of witches are expected to take about a month to return to the West, and he plans to take advantage of this time to The development of the plan is well planned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, with the demise of the Tiffa's remaining party, the opposition forces temporarily disappeared, and the kingdom was nominally unified. Although it will take some time to wait until the secondary city halls in various places to play a role in completely turning Grey Castle into an efficient centralized state, he can start preparing now. When that day comes, the strength of the Grey Fort will inevitably lead to an unprecedented leap, which will open the gap with the other three countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing in development planning is how to make good use of the witch's ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, they are the primary productive forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two months after Anna’s return, the city has undergone a series of changes – the most obvious is Roland’s castle: his mahogany desk is full The foot has doubled, and it is filled with more than ten hand-cranked telephones, which lead to the Witch Building Office, the City Hall, the Military Camp, the Third Side of the City, and the Changge District. When there is an emergency, Jaya You don't have to rely on the legs of the guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the first public telephone appeared on the central square, which connects the city with the hidden forest and extends with the progress of the railroad construction. To meet the needs of workers who have long been unable to return home to contact their families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this line is charged on time, and the number of callers per day is limited and needs to be requested in advance. If you don't want to spend too much money, you can choose a cheaper flight messenger and rail transport delivery. Thanks to the popularity of primary education, text communication has become more and more common for the city without the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one responsible for the operation of these systems is the newly established department of the City Hall: the Ministry of Communications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because its work covers everything from caring for messengers to sending letters to the door, its affiliates instantly become the behemoth next to the Ministry of Construction. Wintertown provided about a thousand jobs and almost wiped out the newly graduated residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this department, Roland has faintly seen the outline of a super-giant group in later generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just the power of Anna alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after solving the devil attack, he put most of his energy into the statistics of the ability of the sleeping island witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the arrival of the second group of migrants, the number of members of the Sleeping Curse has increased to 96, just to test their abilities and let Wendy And the book is too busy, and the individual witches who do not cooperate, the first step is quite difficult. Fortunately, under Tilly’s personal prestige and Wendy’s Huairou offensive, the registration part was finally passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black book now in front of Roland is the result of the initial investigation of the power of all witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been reviewing it for several days and planning the destination for most of the abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be said that the previous classification methods of reinforcement, summoning, and enchantment are too general and are not suitable for intuitive expression of their ability to use, so he simply works Category, reclassify the witches. For example, if you are good at processing, you will be able to return to the manufacturing capacity; if you are close to the animal, you will be assigned to the breeding ability; if you are unable to find the use, you will be placed in the pending column. In this way, the City Hall can clearly see the number of witches available for employment in the major categories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
