			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough..." Fanna got up from the volts and first nervously touched the body and legs and found that there was no missing. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next moment his heart sank again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of people around the fortress that are worn by the bone spears, and there is no air intake, and some soldiers who are worn with their hands and feet are in the muddy ground. Looking around and looking back, I want to find my broken limb. This scene made him feel sore and sour. The team of the artillery battalion was cultivated a little bit. From the resistance of the Duke of the West to the attacking Hermes, there was little loss. Now that I have fallen so much, my heart is uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fanna also knows that now is not the time of sorrow, Miss Angela Nava of the First Army is in the camp, as long as the wounded are sent there. Even if only one breath, Miss Angel can make it regain its vitality! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone!" He climbed his hands and feet to the side of a seriously wounded person who was punctured. "Come and help me!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, I am!" In the dust, two soldiers ran over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take him to the ambulance," Fanner put the intestines flowing out together with the broken meat back into the other's stomach. "Don't drop anything." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big...adult," the man screamed, "I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Less nonsense, it is better to save the devil than to save it," Fanner patted his cheek. "Go back soon, I am waiting for someone to fire, understand?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the casualty was sent away, he ran to another first-aid person. "Are you from the camp?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The other party glanced at the badge on his shoulder and raised his hand. "Yes! What do you have to tell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You continue to be busy with you, save People need to be tight," Fanna waved his hand. "What is the situation in the front line?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the artillery position was attacked, the nearly 500-meter-wide front was everywhere. It’s smoke, except for the guns closest to him. The case team just can not tell, can only vaguely see a lot of shadows on the run, and from time to time there came the roar of guns. However, even the first-aid classes for the ambulance work came in, but did not see the substitute gunners. This is a bit strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil has come in, coming from heaven!" The first-aider had a bandage in his hand and his voice was a little short. "I just came from the central camp and looked at me." I saw those flannel monsters falling to the ground and then hit the reloading team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil actually landed after the spear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the current chaos is caused by the invasion of enemies in the rear, and the substitutes are temporarily unable to get close to the fortress guns. The reserve team, while the front line is still intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After recognizing this, Fanner immediately understood his responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had to get these fortress guns to work again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy wants to stop them from bombarding the constantly approaching devil group, he must not make the other party easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the front line is not broken, this enemy will be solved by the reloading team sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know where I’m looking for a group of monster-like warriors, I can bear a bunch of weights comparable to field guns, but I’m still not breathing, but One thing is certain, these elite warriors will never fall into the wind even if they face the ferocious devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The injured will be handed over to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna is trotting to scatter Next to the bullet box, the whole body was forced to pick up a warhead, sway back to the barrel and push it into the cannon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two charges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, the first-aider screamed at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, be careful behind you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the blood that felt in the moment was solidified He didn't even have time to look back, and he subconsciously rolled on the spot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move saved him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only heard the "beep", an axe passed over the top of his head, slammed on the gun bolt, and shot a series of Mars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and suddenly opposed to a madman! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luo Wei-!" The madman pulled up the axe and screamed toward him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it’s over, Fanna’s mind has only one such thought. Although he has a sabre at his waist, he can’t pull it out because he is lying down, and even if he’s With the handle in hand, how can he block the next blow from the opponent? These guys are all monsters whose strength and speed are far more than ordinary humans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the other party is about to take down the battle axe, Vanna can't help but reach out and stop in front of him-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"咔嚓!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ice wall suddenly rises, the cross frame is between the two, the axe just falls on the wall and splashes a little ice crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is... saved? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so frightened that he turned his head and saw a blue-haired witch with one hand and grabbed it with a single hand, looking calmly at the devil, "behind me." Come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna clenched his teeth, even if his feet were too soft to stand up, he even moved to the side of the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘎,咔咔——————!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you don’t understand the devil The language, he can also feel the enemy's strong anger and killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party rushed out from behind the ice wall, half-squatting down, and the right arm holding the axe swelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the witch does not retreat, the ice spreads under her feet, like the god who rules the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the devil waved his arm, an ice rim rushed out of the ground, and he couldn’t help but fly the axe straight and folded his arm. A strange shape. A half-gray white bone punctures the surface of the skin, and a few muscles are exposed to the air, which looks very awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under waiting for the other party to scream, the ice crystal that has not been naked has climbed up at a speed visible to the naked eye, and after a few seconds, the enemy is frozen into an ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you...thank you," Fanner finally breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not finished yet, the second wave of spears is coming." The witch looked at the dust filled the air, "Miss Morrier!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he suddenly remembered that the devil’s spear attack was intermittent. Since the madman had been able to drive the arm to swell, it meant that the sky was once again dangerous. stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, who is Ms. Morel in the life-saving population? Is it really ok to avoid it now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he is puzzled, a little The childish voice came from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Fanna saw an incredible scene! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a translucent blue sphere on his head without warning, and expands like aeration, and will soon be around ten meters. Into it. At the same time, the tentacles on both sides of the ball swing to the left and right, and the lightly wounded who have not been sent away are dragged into the sphere of the sphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
