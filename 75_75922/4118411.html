			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to allow the glider to run, the Ministry of Construction, according to Roland’s request, built a track pointing directly to the sea on the side of the stone, and the ends of the road were upturned. It is like a string of moons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the experimental prototype is lifted into position, as soon as the retainer is released, it will start to slide under the action of gravity until it rushes out of the track - the entire acceleration process is quite Some are like a roller coaster in later generations, but they are far less exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, these alone do not guarantee that the wing can get enough lift, so Wendy himself needs to create some advantages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you jump out of Shiling, the height difference of up to fifteen meters from the sea surface is ample adjustment space, at the speed of the glider, whether it is climbing or falling The sea, the driver and the ambulanceman can all be prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Roland first gave the prototype a two-seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now lightning and wheat are fighting wildly, and the responsibility of ambulance is naturally handed to Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter readily agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Check in," Roland estimated that time was almost up, and turned to the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wynti nodded, as if he was cheering for himself, he clenched his fist and then walked with the Tilly to the aircraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I climbed the plane, Wendy discovered that this thing was more than I thought. It’s going to be mostly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially two pairs of straight wings under the head and feet, no bird can compare with it, even if it is a beastly, the wheat stubble is worse. So a little length. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sea breeze, the slender wing tip can see obvious jitter, which makes her feel a little uneasy, always feel that once it flies, just scrape it casually With a strong wind, you can break it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Roland once mentioned that this is normal, the strength of the aluminum skeleton can fully cope with the various maneuvers at low speeds, and the skins of Soroya The toughness is also far stronger than ordinary leather and fabric, but these two wings are really thin, compared to their area, it is not too much to say that it is a piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, if you are ready, let me know," the soldier said, letting Wendy come back a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, um... the first thing to do is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confirm Whether the rudder faces are normal.” Tilly, who is behind her, said, “Don’t be nervous, I’ve figured out the problem, and I’m looking at you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”... ...Thank you." Wendy suddenly felt a lot of peace of mind when he heard this. Yes, the flight principle class taught by her Majesty is not the only one she has ever heard. If someone can correct her omission in time, she can also commit less crimes. Some mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First the tail lift, controlled by the main lever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty takes a deep breath, hands Pulling a wrench on the front of the seat, there was a buzzing sound under her body – she knew it was the sound of the bottom wire pulling the tail, and she was already on the simulator before the prototype was built. Practiced hundreds of times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The elevator is normal, then... um, rudder." Tilly continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the components on the simulator are much simpler, two vertical bars, two pedals, and several steel cables make up all of it, Wendy It's hard to believe that with these things, the glider in the mouth can fly like a bird. After all, it is not much more complicated to operate than a bicycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the lifting rod is a rod that can only move back and forth, then the direction lever can only move left and right, the deck has fixed their dead track And the bicycle faucet is good enough to turn around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rudder is also normal, and finally the aileron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first shorter bar is the elevator, which can also be called the tail. When the lift is raised, the nose is raised. When the nose is lowered, the nose is falling, like a rudder lying down. Both of these are very well understood, and Wendy can use the chapter "Decomposition and Synthesis of Forces" in Elementary Physics to presume its working principle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the last bar represents the aileron, until you see the object, Wendy understands where the word "deputy" comes from - - It is embedded in the big wings and the area is less than one tenth of the former. It is connected to the pedals under your feet by the steel cables that pass through the skeleton, just one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different from the former two. It must be raised and raised to be effective. The opposite force on both sides will cause the aircraft to deflect or even roll. The most important control component. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Wendy once asked her, since the rudder can cause deflection, why should we set up a pair of ailerons, and the explanation of the underarm is the three rudders The faces are not effective. Each action needs to be done together. If the rudder is only swung, it will easily cause the traverse of the body. In the case of a sharp turn, the elevator needs to be lowered to stabilize the height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, he needs a detailed test data to write an instructive Flight Manual - what to do in different poses Operation to achieve maneuvering; or the impact of changes in wind direction on the aircraft, as well as the deficiencies felt during operation... After obtaining these data, a truly reliable aircraft is possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The aileron does not seem to have any problems," Tilly patted her on the shoulder. "After it was handed over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty felt her heart beat a bit. She looked at the king in the distance and turned to the soldier and said, "I am ready, open the holder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, please pay attention!" The soldiers immediately got busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The runway has been emptied, the green light is fully open, and Wendy is silent in his heart. Although I don't understand the meaning of this password, if you say that it can bring luck, then you will do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a slight shock, the glider type was pushed onto the track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it is the whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friction between the wheels and the track, the whole body is shaking, she feels that she is quickly sliding down the top of the slope, and the sea at the end of the track Also getting closer and closer to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A heart instantly mentions the eyes of the blind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you going to do next? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought a little flustered, seeing that the track was halfway through, but this thing did not show signs of flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To the wind!" Tilly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, to give the wind - the speed of the run is not enough to support the weight of two people, she needs to create a stable and gentle upper hand, will be huge The bird gently lifted up -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought just came out, her body has already acted, the magic whirlpool is running, an invisible airflow out of thin air Now, it is lightly below the wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh friction sounds have been reduced a lot, and the weight of the glider type seems to be gone, Wendy has not had time to understand the meaning of these changes, the aircraft has already rushed Out of the edge of the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short upturn made her experience a clear sense of overweight, as if someone had reached out and pressed her into the seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the back of the body made her unable to help pull the main lever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nose responded to her control and was lifted more clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angle of view has also changed, the brown land of the dead grass and fallen leaves disappeared without a trace, even the wide vortex sea became a supporting role, blue The color of the sky filled her half of the field of vision, and the glare of the light made her slightly narrow her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
