			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Barov left, Roland put the statistics in the drawer and looked at the nightingale. He wanted to ask her what happened, but hesitated for a while and finally did not Can ask for export. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has an invisible answer in his heart, but this kind of thing always seems embarrassing. If he guessed it wrong, it would be even more embarrassing. Roland had to swallow these words. Belly, "Let's go to the north slope of the mine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Want to see what changes have been made to Soroya's new abilities?" Somewhat strange, but the attitude is still the same as before. She uncovered her hood and smiled. "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I think more, look fast Stepping to the witch next to him, Roland thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of a hot air balloon ride on that day is far more than one or two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never imagined that Soroya would be the second witch to be able to change her quality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she did not even notice this change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also happened to happen this yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the hot air balloon was given to Anna as a gift, it has been placed in the castle courtyard. Anyone who wants to see the scenery from heaven, call Anna and lightning. Until the rain of the previous day, Roland suddenly remembered that the rattan-woven basket would become soft and peeled after being soaked in water. Even if it was dried, it would reduce the toughness and then thought of taking it back to the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intended to ask the attendant to do this, but I can think about it. The hot air balloon is a gift to Anna, and the ropes and airbags are easy. Damaged, simply decided to move it back to the castle. When he called the hummingbird to the vestibule, he was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the basket full of patterns - all from the aerial view of the town, but different from the previous photo style, this time Her paintings are like standing up. Roland didn't care for the falling raindrops, and when she looked at it, she saw the first time that her painting had "thickness." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not surprising that the thickness is painted. In theory, the real painting should be thick—because the pigment itself has a thickness. In oil painting, this thickness can even be used: using brushstrokes, brushes or scrapers to create a rugged texture that enhances texture through layering and enhances the expressiveness of the picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike Soroya, her paintings are not drawn with pens and paints, but by the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thickness of these magical shapes is particularly strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He still remembers that when he touched the raised woods with his hand, it was like scratching branches and green leaves, they were not hard solids. It is a slightly soft gel. When you touch the ground, the touch is a lot harder, as if he is really touching a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those rains flow down the landscape and cannot be immersed in the rattan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the castle, he immediately called Soroya, and the nightingale confirmed this. Under the fog observation, the magic in the body of Soroya is no longer a golden vortex like the one before, but is condensed into a ribbon that is constantly rotating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the military factory compound, Anna smiled and greeted her and gave Roland a Big hug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the selection of the relationship, her intimacy in front of her has obviously increased. Roland licked her head in a good mood, and the silver clip on her head shone in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his afterglow saw that Soloya, who was also preparing to come over to the ceremony, stood at the same place and was at a loss, and finally opened his eyes and opened his eyes. I didn’t see anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," the nightingale took Soroya back to the table and deliberately asked, "Is this all you painted?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
