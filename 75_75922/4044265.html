			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The losers from the soul battlefield are obviously completely accepted by the dream world. The most obvious point is that they clearly have different colors of hair, face It is also very different from urban residents, but no one feels weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Roland himself is a long gray hair, with a tall nose and light gray eyes. If you put it in the original world, it will definitely attract everyone. The side of the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents are now just like ordinary people - the young guy bites the fritters, rushing with a briefcase and a newspaper, probably going to the company’s early shuttle Older people gather in the open space in front of the apartment building in twos and threes. Some of them wave their limbs and do leisurely exercises in the morning, while others set up chess booths and play chess against the same team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the high and low screams, the baby’s crying, the hawker’s sipping and the early reading from the corridor gradually merged into the morning breeze. The urban noise from all directions is mixed together, forming a unique symphony belonging to the era of the Pavilion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene full of life makes Roland feel particularly missed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a woman ran down the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chopsticks in Roland’s hands shook subconsciously, and the man was Garcia Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw her wearing a lightweight sportswear, revealing white thighs, gray hair tied to the top of her head, and a towel around her neck. The sweat soaked her collar and the fine sweat on her arm, apparently has been running for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that the people in the alleys pointed their eyes at her, and many guys whistled and looked very excited. It’s like seeing a star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Garcia did not care, the pace kept, like the wind through the alley streets, and finally disappeared at the apartment building crossing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s that Garcia!" someone in the powder shop exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't make a mistake, I can see her sooner, as long as the weather is good, she will run here for an hour every day."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was the first time I met a character on TV."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She looks much better than on TV. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Jiaxia has a major competition recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I will support her anyway, I hope she can win the last."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Nonsense, she is a genius!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding arguments made Roland very surprised. How do you feel that the residents here are familiar with Garcia? What is the game? Is it because she is a new star in the sports world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the boss came over to clean the table, he drank the last soup and asked out the wallet. "Why, is that woman famous?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss looked at him with a surprised look. "You are not the one who lives here. Who in the street does not know the name of Miss Garcia." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just moved in," Roland’s curiosity was even heavier. "What does she do?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a martial artist!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" He almost didn't squirt his mouth, "cough... what?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you know when you go to watch TV. She is the most famous person in this area. It is because she lives here that we can Living here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss pointed to Roland," Look there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Demolition?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the development company has long wanted to demolish the new skyscraper, saying that the street is too old and placed in the bustling area of ​​the city. It’s unsightly, put their shit, it’s obvious that the building is right!” The boss sighed as he looked for money. “The gang wants to move us all over the suburbs, if not Garcia shakes it on TV. Come, I have won the support of many people, and the developers are estimated to have started to catch up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took a slap in the mouth. "That is really... a bit too much. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we all admire Miss Garcia," the boss smiled and took the change to his hand. "Since you are a member of the street." Sooner or later, she will be hers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the dreams in order to put some Pieces that are clearly inconsistent piece together, will use some incredible power, but it is too ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Wudou family? New project for the Olympics? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And demolition of the soul building? Here you can connect the door to the memory debris, and still live the Creator! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotions, can he live here, thanks to the third sister? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland returned to Room 0825 with a complicated mood, and Jie Luo just walked out of the bedroom with a sleepy eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hair was messed up, the dress was crumpled, and the neckline slid down, revealing half a shoulder. "Uncle, are you up? I am going now." Breakfast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have eaten, and I have brought you a meal by the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put the fried omelettes, siu mai and milk on the table, then turn on the TV. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little girl looked down at the table with a puzzled look. "How do you get up earlier?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said that I found a job, naturally I can't sleep any more. You have a living fee at home, and the company has also issued the first salary. You don't have to worry about money for the time being."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's also a problem, who knows how long you can stick, and the dishes in the refrigerator haven't finished yet." That being said, Jieluo is still very fast. The breakfast was swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, do you know Garcia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, Garcia sister is Genius," she grinned. "I joined the Martial Arts Association at the age of twenty. I heard that there was no defeat in the qualifiers. The classmates regarded her as an idol, but I think they were on the stage. It’s quite boring to fight.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention why Jiaxia would be called a sister, but she was an uncle, listening to the little girl’s argument, these fights The home has also established an organization? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The martial arts family...has there a lot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only a handful," Luo took a look at him. "You don't even think about your uncle. Not everyone has this talent. Only those who have awakened the power of nature can take this path. And awakening is just an entry condition, no perseverance. And perseverance, in the end, will only become a shackle of power, and plainly bring a lot of trouble to everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...How do you know so much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our teacher said, he also said that if you have the illusion of becoming a martial artist, you should do more than two sets of exercises, and then strive to be a society. "The person." After she went to the bathroom to wash it, she took her bag and walked to the gate. "Today I have to go to class all day, I am leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After Jielu left, Roland reached out and felt the strange power in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this what she calls the power of nature? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
