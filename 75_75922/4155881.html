			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, they climbed up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's get closer and fire again, we bring The bullets can be as many as the machine guns!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat's claws find a suitable position for shooting and set up the Fanna rifle in their hands. While waiting for the enemy, he did not forget to sweep the position of the floating land. I wonder if it is an illusion. The continent seems to be rising. It can barely see its edge before. Now I can only see the corner below it. A distinct abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But one thing is certain, during this time the fortress has been close to the desperate mountain range, and the huge shadow has climbed the corner of the mountains. When I thought that I might be fighting under it, the cat's claws felt a lot of breathing, as if the back was pressed with heavy stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damn devil must be resolved quickly, leaving the mountains in front of the floating land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the same as he thought, when the spider magic climbed into the 500-meter area, the machine gun team finally let go of the limit and spurted the target toward the steep slope. Long flame tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the forests of the valley boiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat's claw also pulled the trigger at the most confident stage of 150 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of snow and fog in front of everyone's muzzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are not professional shooters, the modified rifle is the most active one due to the influence of Fanner. In the semi-automatic mode, as long as the five or six vanners do not get stuck, they can burst out in the short time as much as the machine gun group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a small spider with a high frontal hardness, the significance of the intensity of firepower has been raised to a new level. If it is a standard first-time general army, it is not easy to block a large number of spiders who are not afraid of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a black light emerged from the woods, rippled like ripples, and penetrated everyone in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It comes fast, goes fast, but only about a second before and after. If the teammates around me shook a little, the cat's claws thought it was just their own illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just...what do you see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be a black one Ripple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat's claw touched his body and there seemed to be no abnormality. The line of defense has not suffered any damage, and this can be heard from the constant stream of gunshots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably the eccentric stone pillar," the teammates inserted a new magazine into the gun. "These things are full of surprises. The appearance is stone, but there is flesh and blood inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat's claws have not continued to go deeper than the harmless black light, or kill the spider magic that climbed up first. more important. However, he soon discovered that the snow in front of him was darkening, as if the sun was blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, is the floating land already entering the mountains? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and couldn’t help but see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress is still in its original position, the change is the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the sky that was just fine, it was already overcast, and the golden stream was moving through it, like what was being saved - this transformation speed was completely exceeded In the category of the sky, his heart suddenly rose to a very unknown feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have also noticed the vision of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just ten short seconds, the dark clouds have been densely covered to cover the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tens of thousands of streamers continue to gather to a point, faintly blooming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat's claws slammed out of the horn, and when it was blowing, countless electric lights fell from the clouds, spreading out in a fan shape, and instantly fell into the line of defense of the blocking force! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous firepower came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is - God's Inscription?" Seagull, Wendy Unthinkingly took a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid that it is a similar magic stone even if it is not a seal." Andrea looked back in a dignified manner. "Lightning, are you okay?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm fine," heard the other voice of the other side of the print, "The enemy should notice me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just stay on the side, this is not a battle you can intervene." Andrea said. The corrugation was obviously directed at lightning. For this vision, the witch who participated in the ambush of Taqila is familiar, but that is the unique ability of the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of a large-scale spread of demon is definitely the nemesis of a flexible witch like lightning. Once it is affected, the inertia brought by speed can make her In danger. The enemy's previous plan is undoubtedly to cut off her ability, and then let her fall into the scope of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately fortunately, this lightning, after hearing Wendy’s warning, did not rush forward as it used to, which also gave her the strength Open the black ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let McMug go to inform the reserve team, blocking the troops may be in trouble." Then Andrea looked to Sylvie, "Can you find the target? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter took a deep breath, "It has already rushed to the top of the slope, the speed is amazing, there is no visible eye presence nearby, we should not have caused It is alert. However, the line of defense has been smashed by the thunder, but I am afraid that there is no way to resist the follow-up spiders."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means the soldiers will face up close Stone needle spray of the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now she has no time to take care of this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Hilli’s instructions, Andrea finally caught the demon in the sight. At the same time, her heart is also going down, this speed is more than just fast, it can be called erratic! As long as you slow down for a while, you will completely lose your trace. If you want to catch the shot, you must be closer. Otherwise, even if the ability picks out the must-have coin for her, the process of flying the bullet is enough to get out of the bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point also caught the attention of Andrea, in the battle with the First Army, wearing a full-faced heavy armor almost There is no blue barrier light - this is not something that can be explained by speed alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the period of observing the target, the dark clouds of the sky did not dissipate, and the golden electro-optical light once again formed and fell from the sky-<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party has a second look! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It confirms Hilli’s warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of magic, it has unfathomable potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has no time to hesitate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia suppressed the doubts in her heart and shouted to Wendy, "We have to go down, just like the last attack on Heckzold - only By being close enough, I can guarantee that the goal does not escape!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How close?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "As long as you don't enter the demon range, the closer you are!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can be difficult..." Wendy sighed, "if The driver is Tilly, but now I am changing the control of Miss Saiwei. I have to control not only the winds of multiple faces but also the situation of the other party at the same time. This is not an easy task..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't you?" Andrea's heart was slightly tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
