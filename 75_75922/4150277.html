			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days later-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it my Royal Highness Princess?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this is the news that the command has just received. The exact number is still being verified, but at least it should be at least 600."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The whistle and squad has already implemented containment, they should move from land to no winter city after the break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, this is what we should do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s hard for you, please rest well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After the report, Isis hangs up the microphone steadily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the highest level of communication at present, the hand-cranked phone has become an indispensable device for the staff, but it is limited by the transmission distance and can now be directly connected to the cage. In the highlands of the mountain, there is only the empty knight camp outside the town of Thorns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just turned around and saw a surprised third brother, Lance Kant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different from the second brother, Isis The relationship directly transferred Lance, who passed the primary education assessment, to the General Staff Department. Considering that the younger brother's temper is more relaxed, she thinks it is more appropriate to look at herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is more convenient for her to appreciate the pain of the other side in the face of frustration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...no, nothing, I’m just an accident. The old sister will also respect you." Lance walked with a stack of documents. Come up, "You used to talk to your father, you are not so polite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that your adult brain capacity will increase slightly after adulthood. A little bit." Itis doesn't think, "I said to my father, because my father won't take me, but Tilly Wimbledon is the younger sister of Roland, if she mentions me in front of her brother. Rude, what do you think of the future of Kant's family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I always feel that you are all right to you...not so serious..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it is a man, occasionally taking the initiative can produce miraculous effects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃... I don't quite understand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The human heart is the highest state of strategy, it doesn't understand," Itis shrugged. "You even There are thousands of things, and people who don't understand people can't be the ultimate winners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister, can you teach me?" Lance asked expectantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Isis glanced at him with interest, "but anything is more effective than just a simple lecture, such as Cole said that he did very well at this point. How do you want to try it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lanston felt a chill on his mind, Lenovo When he was at home, he swallowed. "That... I will wait any longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northland Pearl regained its gaze," You decide for yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance, who is a big man, has quickly changed a topic. "Right, are you calling your Highness to report the safe arrival of the refugees? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis nodded. "After all, Tilly’s return came to the staff to explain the matter. Of course, I must tell her the first time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire rescue operation exceeded all expectations, and the Air Knight not only went to two hundred in just over an hour. Outside the battlefield, the rescued a large number of refugees, but also in one fell swoop defeat the wiles of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is not an ordinary hunt. Looking at the clues obtained afterwards, the refugees are probably only the bait thrown by the enemy, and the real fatal blow is hidden behind the chase squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the bad weather and long distances, if you want to arrive quickly, you must go to the light, day and night. In order to maximize the time of chasing, the devil is completely sentimental. When the two sides collide, the rescue team will find that they are not only facing the enemy whose number is not lower than their own, but also against the attack from the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you retreat immediately, you have to travel nearly 100 kilometers in the snow, how many people can finally escape? I am afraid that none will be there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first test of the devil's overall contraction of the First Army. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the latter did not care about the refugees, or did not find the pursuit of the north of the Wind Whistling, there was no loss to the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have probably noticed that there is a fundamental difference between the Grey Fortress and the Wolf Heart and the Yongdong, even if they kill more locals. It has any impact on the outcome of the battle of God's will, and every time a rescue team is eliminated, it will weaken the human power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the appearance of the Cavaliers made the ambush unprepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is quite like the shooting of the North Slope in a year ago. The enemy and the First Army each made a judgment that would be beneficial to them. The results are quite different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Tilly did not find another enemy that was hidden behind, there would be no change in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final flight team returned safely, and the escaped refugees were lucky enough to escape from birth, which is a great victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The empty knight is really amazing..." Lance sighed. "Not only did you kill dozens of madmen, but you still have the whole body in all directions." Retired, even if it was the former Confederation of the Holy Army, it is very difficult to do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it is really amazing."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sigh of relief, and Itis stood on the table with her legs on the table and slowly leaned back on the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance snorted, "Do you seem to be...somewhat unhappy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No I can’t say it, I just think... The staff will soon be put up.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“诶?” The three brothers widened their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The four Skyfires will be able to retreat more than two hundred devils, if the First Army has a hundred or even a thousand Skyfire?" Itis smiled. "So just a word, where there is an enemy, send an empty knight to where. Strategy and calculations will become meaningless, and anyone in the previous sentence will say that if this step is reached, What is the staff and what is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when she first saw this free-flying machine, she realized that it was The huge military potential that exists, and the most talked about with Roland, is also about the use of the empty knight. Even she built a team dedicated to Air Force tactics within the staff team to maximize the use of such new weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it really shines in the first battle, Beidi Pearl feels a little regret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the advantages of the Air Knight are too obvious, the importance of the strategy has declined. In the era of the Cavaliers, the formation of tactics and tactics was very particular, but now it is no doubt simplified. Because the Air Force has the advantage of vision, it can make the battlefield information more transparent, and with strong mobility, enough Interrupt the entire war zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, as long as you can occupy the sky, you can completely grasp the enemy’s every move, and the enemy’s situation is completely opposite. The situation is almost in the dark. In addition to passive beatings, it is difficult to respond effectively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention that it has also been revealed that the Skyfire is only just starting, it is equivalent to the same as the current Mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the case...we will go back to the night city," Lance whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’m afraid it’s too late,” Itis chuckled. “I can sit down in this position, I’m afraid I’ve offended a lot of people. You think Will those people let me enjoy the rest of my life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
