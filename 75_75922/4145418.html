			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was not able to return to God for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The master of Garcia...should be yelling right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the woman who met him at the Rose Cafe early in the morning... died? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is limited by the rules of the dream world, it is also a martial artist who guards the disciples level, and it is only necessary to deal with a few demon people. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, Prism City is based on the transformation of the mine. The main body is buried deep underground, and there are also awakened guards. How can it be easily attacked by the demon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He resisted the emotions of his heart, and calmly pulled up the other party, "Go into the house and say it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiacia stood up softly, as if the strength of the whole body had been lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland threw the sleeping clean radish into the bedroom and gave Garcia a cup of warm milk. In the bright light, the latter's mood gradually stabilized. Although the eyes were still out of focus, the tears finally stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he noticed that because he was too anxious and forgot to have a dozen missed calls and six unread on the phone in his pocket. The text message, turned over, was basically called by Jia Xia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, sorry... Jielu suddenly had a fever, I was anxious to go to the hospital and forgot to bring the phone." Roland said something unnaturally, "Prisma What happened in the city? How did you know the situation of your master?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia was silent for a long time, until he thought he was When she didn't speak, she said intermittently, "When I was close to noon, I received an emergency communication from C02... I said that the headquarters headquarters had an abnormal situation and asked the local martial artists to prepare for the support..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you remember correctly, C02 is the liaison officer of the last joint annihilation operation, Roland thought, so she would call so many calls to herself, "but the support was not implemented later. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, Garcia should have gone to Prism City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, because the culprit causing the anomaly is... the erosion of the middle layer suddenly expanded." She muttered. "No one saw how it happened." The monitoring did not capture the moment of change. I heard from C02 that when the association reacted, the erosion almost cut off the prism city and the upper and lower layers lost contact."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erosion...Expand? Roland suddenly jumped in his heart. If the red moon is essentially the "empty" caused by erosion, in theory, it should be able to appear anywhere - this naturally includes underground. If the "Red Moon" is regarded as the beginning of the war of divinity, then is the sudden increase in erosion equal to the red moon in another sense? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The specific time when there is a certain change in the headquarters?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is slightly Nodded, "It should be about nine o'clock in the morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost the same as the ripples over the city! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a dream that the world is warning him that power from outside has begun to erode here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the matter of the demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They...is from Killed underground..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Roland got a general idea of ​​the whole thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware that erosion is engulfing the central part of the city, the martial arts association immediately organized a rescue operation - the prism city is inserted directly into the ground like a huge awl In the depths, such a structure provides excellent defensive performance without being completely flawless. For example, the ventilation system must be running at all times to ensure that the middle and lower layers are breathing smoothly. In addition, other materials such as water, food, etc. are also transported from top to bottom. Therefore, when the erosion breaks the prism city, the life of the lowest level employees will be in jeopardy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the possibility of enemy attacks was ruled out, the martial arts association naturally cancelled the support request. At that time, the guards and all the disciples were there, and the engineering team and the medical team were urgently needed at the headquarters. The martial arts who did not help the rescue were also on standby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, nothing happened. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squad in Well 04 was suddenly attacked by the demon when the crowds plunged into the various evacuation wells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, some people recognized that many of the demons were companions whose association was trapped in the lower class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sounds extremely shocking and ridiculous – no one knows what happened under the city’s spine in the hours after the interruption But what is presented to the people is a group of monsters that blend with the fallen core. There are both ordinary employees and martial artists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to enter the lower level of the Prism is undoubtedly the most reliable backbone of the association, what makes them betray the association in less than half a day, this It is still unknown. But there is no doubt that when they integrate the fallen core into their own body, they are no longer a member of humanity. Even Roland, I was surprised to hear it for a long time, not to mention the shock of the rescue team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that the team was caught off guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the fact that both quantity and strength are not dominant, it is not the end of the whole army that has been played by the outstanding performance. However, as the captain's cockroach, she failed to return to the ground safely - when she closed an isolation door, she was attacked by several demon stalkers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, Garcia couldn’t help but sob again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland re-raised her for a cup of milk. After hesitating for a moment, he still asked the question he was most concerned about - although it sounded out of place, he must Get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These messages should be survivors to the headquarters?" He took a deep breath. "Someone really witnessed your master sacrificed?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is normal, this kind of question is likely to be embarrassing, but Garcia is confused at this moment, completely unaware of Roland’s intention, "My master... The master blocked the closed switch with her body... and was torn into pieces by the demon. At that time, many people in the team saw this scene..." She squatted on the coffee table, suppressing the voice and crying, "Hey... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Sorrow." Roland could not help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know what happens to people in the dream world, is it re-associated with consciousness or completely disappeared? But if the gods really control most of the ideology, no matter what kind of ending can not be a good result. Losing the shelter of the dream world, what kind of endure a betrayer will face, do not want to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that he associates this with the gods – this change is like a layout for 岚. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the gods are not limited to one goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream world is what the other party wants to destroy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you have to protect it here... If you lose it, the conscious world will always be closed to you." Roland couldn't help but remember the jealousy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he is going to play a battle of divineness in the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opponent is neither a devil nor a sea of ​​heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will face the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noisy voice rang in the ear, as if it was far away, as if it were close at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
