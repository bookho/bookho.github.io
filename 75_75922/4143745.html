			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun fell, the temperature between the mountains quickly fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be a place to spend the night, lightning thought. The temperature difference between the desperate barriers is astonishing. After crossing the sea of ​​clouds, the sunlight in the daytime is like roasting people. If not covered, the exposed skin is easily sunburned. Once at night, the whistling wind will quickly take away all the heat. If you still sleep on the treetops like a forest, you will freeze into the ice the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, you must find a safe haven before the night completely covers the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today is here," Lightning said, listening to the seal, "I am going to find a nest, and you bring something back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 was unable to answer in flight, but she knew that the other party had heard her contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she lowered her height and entered the state of flying on the ground--Ai Gesha repeatedly smashed before departure, or flew high when looking for the devil's trail Or stick to the ground, don't change the path at will. Otherwise, once you accidentally enter the area affected by the Shenshi vein, no one can save it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning strictly enforced this trick. In this mountain, no one can help her with any accident, she must take care of herself and Mai at the same time. Hey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she had noticed possible hiding places before the search, she quickly found a cave half-opened between the mountains - the terrain is like Stone forests, tens of thousands of hills almost equal in height, crowded together, each hill is almost no winter city size, it will not make people look at it outside, but it has a wonderful place here. The change is as if the mountain is carved into a general by a big hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap between the hill and the hill becomes a natural waterway, and when it encounters a heavy rain, the mountain torrent will carry the force of the force. More crucially, the climate change on the mountains is extremely intense. It may be clear skies here. There is lightning and thunder on the other side. If the inexperienced explorer chooses to camp in the mountains for convenience, it will probably be a night. There is no sign of big water rushing people to turn over, so whether or not there is an ideal shelter, the foothold must be chosen high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since entering this mountainous area known as the continental spine, she has seen it several times in similar situations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the hills here are different from other places. Most of the time, the stone walls of the mountains should be steep and sharp, but these hills are basically round and round. The shape is even a soft couch with a recessed hole on it, as if it were not a naturally formed rock, but what the fluid solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, they still retain the rigidity of the stone, enough to hold a place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the cave is quite large, almost ten meters square, with some weed branches scattered inside, which is estimated to be left when the birds and beasts make their nests. After confirming that there was no potential danger, Lightning informed the McMug and then picked up the temporary residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the setting sun was completely replaced by the night, the wheat stalk that turned into a snow owl returned to the cave. She shook her feathers and regained her adult shape. She raised her chest like a gift. "Look at what I found!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning After the bag, a pheasant and four huge bird eggs were pulled out from inside. This is a rare harvest on the shackles of desperation. Even if you are hunting for experienced wheat stubble, you may not be able to return home every time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning touched her head and exchanged one A smug smile, "嘿嘿."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire quickly rose, and she used the mud deposited on the bottom of the mountain to form a stove to prevent the fire from being discovered. Cover the mud on the broiled pheasant, put it all in the fire, and finally cover the eggs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty minutes later, dinner is a success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cue cooking technique, the two have been implemented many times in the fascinating forest, it is practice makes perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil that is leached under the skin makes the chicken sparkle, and the spices filled in the belly are fully excited under the baking, and the heat is absorbed into the whole body; after removing the soft outer skin, the rest is all tender and delicious. . Different from the directly cooked products of the flame, the whole chicken has no scorch marks, and the meat is as white as new. When you tear it, you can see the filaments connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With steamed eggs, the two of them soon ate their mouths and even the chicken bones were not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey," Mai said, "I’m still the most delicious food I have.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy, obviously when he first met, also plaused the words "you actually want to eat a bird". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning shook his head with a funny smile. "What did you find today? In addition to eating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey, no jealousy... The landform here is basically the same. If there is a trace of the devil's action, I will definitely find it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, if the god stone vein If you are buried in the ground, it is too difficult to find clues by airborne investigation alone. I don't know where Tacira's support fleet is now. If they can give a general direction, even if the position is blurred, it is much better than blindly looking for it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the flash voltage, pointing to the side of the cave, "If that's the case, then go and give me a bed!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"喔--Understanding 咕." Mai Hao dragged the long white hair to her designated position, and turned into a fearful beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning extinguishes the fire and lies in her belly bend - limited by the size of the nest, the heating methods of the two are not the same, compared to Squeezing each other in a small sleeping bag, it is obviously more comfortable for the wheat to use the form of a beast to resist the cold wind. At least her stomach is like a huge heater, which is enough to ensure that the night will not be frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But doing this is not without flaws. The skin of the beast is quite rough, and can even be described with a shave. Lightning can’t help but miss the fur of Loja. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still not sleeping?" Seeing her picking up the glowing magic stone, Mai Hao asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I have to record today's route. It won't take long. You should sleep first."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Mai Xiaowen Weng, after a while, she suddenly muttered, "You will continue to explore with me in the future?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning stunned, then whispered back, "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the ash is gone, I will Take the responsibility to protect you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the answer, Mai Hao finally closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning stayed for a long time before taking out the notepad from the pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now on the tenth day of their entry into the northern mountainous region of the Yongdong Kingdom. The search distance has reached 120 kilometers. The deeper she is in the depths of desperation, the more she can feel her own smallness. In this place where no one has ever been involved, she has seen many indescribable scenes – like the vast expanses of rocky landforms in the fertile plains, the icefalls that hang straight into the sea from the northeast, and the rising clouds like stairs. And a huge rift in the center of the continental spine... Compared to this area, the desperate mountain range separating the four kingdoms is just a branch that spreads out. These scenery are hidden above the mountains, and if you don't cross the cliff-like cliffs, you can't see them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning faintly understands why the father is so addicted to adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is too broad, and if you don’t look at it, people will always be insignificant. Only by understanding can we make ourselves bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining to be an explorer is the most correct choice in her life. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; of course, can be placed to explore the world to do after the lightning did not forget he still has tasks in the body - if fly too far away from permanent winter, the search efficiency If you don’t talk about it, it will make the support team worry. According to the time, the "Roland" should also arrive at the Yongdong Harbour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
