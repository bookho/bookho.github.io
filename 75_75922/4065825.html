			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark nights have long been a barrier to both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that once the bullet drop and firing effect are not observed, the head of the machine gun team will drop significantly. Although the number of machine guns put into the ambush is not as good as the cold wind hurdles, it will not be able to completely stop even the cavalry charge. When the enemy abandoned the torch, there were always dozens of people on a front line that could break through the crossfire network, screaming at the artillery position and then becoming Danny's target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the enemy can't tell where the real threat is, they can't see the companions being beaten in the fire net, and they don't understand the dunes on both sides. What kind of weapon is standing on top of it. It’s too late when they realize that there are fewer and fewer people around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the instructions of the torch, the cavalry who followed the new front line did not know what happened to the group of companions in front of them. You can only see the roaring artillery that is not far away and the flashing spots on both sides. How do you think that the thunderous bombardment is more threatening, not the sand dunes on both sides that are invisible to the figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is under this obstacle that the watchdog did not collapse, but instead formed a series of assault lines, like the sea waves flooding into the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of these warriors, the continuous sharp edge charge is the best way to dispel the enemy’s will to fight - speed represents power, in the tide In the face of the offensive, the slaves and mercenaries can't resist for a long time. No matter how strong the line looks like, once the cavalry rushes in, it will take a long time to become a sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has created an excellent hunting opportunity for Danny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, he took the twentieth prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, he also noticed a strange phenomenon - several times when aiming at the enemy in the forefront, there will always be a bullet that takes it earlier than him. Go to the target that has been locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like someone is competing with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that's the only way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Danny feel excited is that this shooter hidden in the night is definitely a top hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the enemy is falling in the same direction, it is on the same side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose to face it like him, hit the upper body, the target will fall backwards, hit the horse, it will turn forward - he said no The specific principle, but in all likelihood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target is dumped to the side, only to show the location of the hunter, which is on the sand dunes on one side. And every time the point is hit, it's the torso, not the mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party can not only capture the fast-running rider on a dull night, but also determine where the target will arrive before the fire, plus the desert. Unpredictable cold wind, this hand can almost be called a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there such a good player in the military? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it the person who is the precision shooting team, or is it like himself, the gunman who was picked up and given a new type of bolting gun? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny shook his excitement and accelerated his movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not want to lose to the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in front of malt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is one left on the right, two hundred and fifty meters from the line of defense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He It’s mine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the middle of the night, the thunder gradually subsided But Thuram has never heard the cheers of returning to the samurai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
