			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo Spoel returned home after finishing the test today, and his wife had cooked the pancakes and mushroom soup and filled him up. A glass of white wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter two are goods sold in the convenience market, especially the white mushroom, just like the introduction on the sign: "You are looking for it again." It’s not so delicious and delicious,” he said after he tasted it. As long as you eat the next piece, it is hard to forget this full and unique taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, its price is also very amazing, a palm-sized one needs a silver wolf, if it is not a full-paying, Kaimo is reluctant to buy such expensive food. There are many things like this, such as soaps and mirrors. As long as you have money, life in the town is much more comfortable than the average aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is simply unfathomable, and this is what he feels the most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, the wife handed a letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guards arrived in the afternoon, you have not returned yet. "When the wife cleaned up the tableware, he said, "Listen to him, it seems to be from Chishui City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Kemo walked into the study and used Cut the knife with a knife and take out the stationery to spread it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sentence at the beginning is actually "Hello, Dear Teacher." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a letter from Chamez. He can't help but smile, sit at the desk and study it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Chishui City Alchemy Square, another alchemist, Capola, became a new seat. However, this person was narrow-minded and obtained the crystal glass formula left by Kaimo. He not only claimed to the lord that this was his work with Kaimo, but also intentionally or unintentionally crowded Chames in the alchemy experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He complained in the letter, perhaps because he borrowed the apprentice of Capola when he explored the double stone acid method, but did not inform the other party in advance. . Now several other alchemists seem to have begun to evade him intentionally or unintentionally, which makes Chames feel very annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemo can probably understand the thoughts of these people. Chammes is the youngest alchemist in the refining room. Many people think that he just relies on luck and his own Appreciation has stood out from many disciples. However, the alchemist sneered at this view. Saltpeter and green scorpion are common things. Why is it that Chalmers has a double stone acid method instead of others, it is enough to explain the problem. Observation, memory, bold conjecture, and careful experimentation are indispensable. The young man’s talent is even above himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Chamez also attached two alchemy formulas to the letter, saying that it was a new development when studying two acids recently, and shared it with the tutor. At the first glance, Kaimo saw that the essence of the two formulas is only the neutralization reaction of the salt formed by the acid and the base. In this way, he can write more than a dozen in one breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighed, Camo Stoll put down the stationery and his eyes moved to the "Primary Chemistry" that had been turned over several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the “old book” that His Highness gave to himself. If it weren't for it, I am afraid that, like Chames, I still look for the surface soil in chaos and confusion and regard it as a treasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the book and went straight to the last page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a table that is neatly divided into a hundred squares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time I see this form, he can't help but pick up the goosebumps, and the heart feels indescribable reverence... and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top left corner of the grid is marked with a small serial number, and the end is a total of one hundred and eighteen, except for the first two rows, most of the grids are Blank, but some of them are filled with symbols. For example, No. 26: Iron, No. 29: Copper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the form is called the Periodic Table of the Elements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemist shivered holding the book and asked Roland about the contents of the blank. The answer was "It was originally filled, but he really remembered it." Can't get up." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
