			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning after the end of the Games, when Roland walked into the meeting hall, the officials who had already waited for it stood up and brushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit down." He walked to the main seat and looked around for a week, whispering, "I must have known why I called you here - war It has already begun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not just a matter of the military. From this moment on, I ask the managers of each department of the kingdom and the administrative department. They can have a basic understanding of the situation and direction of the war, and actively play their own role to jointly cope with the expedition!" he said word by word, "No winter city has been established so far, everyone has achieved pride. The results, but before the crisis of disappointment, all this is like a pavilion on the ice floe - do not take down the ruins of Takira, red fog may swallow the entire continent at any time, then the devil will be unstoppable. So this war only Xu Sheng, don't give up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty!" Barov and others are all the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good," Roland looked at Isis. "The next step is to explain the specific strategic direction by the General Staff Department."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Northland Pearl stood up and gracefully raised his chest. "Please allow me to use the big map to explain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She went to Roland's side and knocked on the map of the West on the background wall. After many revisions and additions, this map will cover almost half of the wild and uninhabited areas. No winter city starts from the beginning. The center position becomes a negligible little point on the edge. Anyone who has a glance at it will realize the narrowness of human settlements, and this is one of Roland’s original intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hopes that his ministers and officials can put their horizons farther away, instead of being addicted to the existing interests all day long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first thing to be sure is that this Northern Expedition is different from what we have experienced in the past. It will last for a long time." Itis I’m going to see the mountain road. “I hope everyone understands that we can’t do this quickly.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision shield used in the Battle of the North Slope, It is impossible to come again for the second time - the distance between the fascinating forest and the ruins of Takira is much larger than that of the destroyed outpost. The time for laying the railway is at least monthly, and it is inevitable that it is impossible to make the devil unaware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vast fertile plains, the enemy has an absolute maneuver advantage, so Roland gave up the fantasy of winning the surprise attack at the beginning, intending to invest in superior strength, front and devil Start a duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that this will be a contest between spear and shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program is something that everyone has known for a long time, so no one is surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Barov asked, "So, do you have an estimated time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It depends on the strength of the devil's counterattack." Itis is not flustered. "The General Staff Department commissioned the Takira witch to carry out several simulations, assuming that the enemy's scale of attack is similar to that of the North Slope, every other week. Once, within three months we can put the fortress gun on the other's face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they are not fools, can't be repeated again and again And the three places repeat the same mistakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I think the devil will soon notice the role of the railway, even the hidden forest in the rear. Of course we also Not unprepared - just because the war situation is full of variables, I hope that the Executive Office can allocate resources with the worst intentions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The worst plan is ..." Barov frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From spring to winter, until a new round of evil moons come." Itis calmly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that equal to failure?" The boss yelled. "This does not meet the requirements of your Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you don't withdraw, the battle will not end, and it will be called the stalemate at most." Northland Pearl smiled slightly. "When the next year is snowing, then fight again." See the Executive Director Difficult, she added, "But the possibility of this situation is not great, after all, the speed of the devil is more than the production of bullets, I am just just in case."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
