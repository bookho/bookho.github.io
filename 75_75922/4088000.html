			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought for a while, remembering that the United Chamber of Commerce was a cooperative supply and marketing organization under his leadership, and its main members were several large fjords. The island's luxury business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the autumn negotiations reached a basic consensus, the chaotic drinks produced by Evelyn were far from the share of mass sales, so the chambers of commerce Only a few bottles of samples were taken back and they were not officially sold. This time they should be coming for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the winter offensive and the Desert Action Plan, as well as the entire Western Front, are preparing for the reunification of the kingdom, he for the time left the matter of the Confederation Chamber. Now the other side took the initiative to find it, and saved him a lot of effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take them to the living room, I will arrive later," Roland said. After Barov's promise to leave, he turned to the nightingale again. "I will inform Tilly and Wendy to let them also come to the castle. This is the first business that the Witch Alliance and the Sleeping Island cooperated."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the living room, several businessmen immediately stood up and bowed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the old acquaintance Margaret, the Crescent Moon Chamber of Commerce, the Moore and Marlan, the names of several other people, Roland recalled, remembered, respectively It is the Nielong of the Shallow Water City Chamber of Commerce and the Etienne of the Sunset Island Chamber of Commerce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he sat down, Nibelon couldn’t wait to open his mouth. "Your Majesty, the last sample brought back caused a great sensation on the island’s merchants, but where I have tasted a novelty. No one does not praise its novelty. I bet that as soon as the sale begins, Chaotic Beverage will become the most successful commodity in the history of the fjord!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"And it's not just as simple as drinking a drink," said Etienne. "For example, the bottle of red and spicy spicy juice, although not too thirsty, but poured on steamed fish or barbecue is exceptional. It's delicious; it can also be used to chill and refresh, and it's more effective than your liquor – at least the latter is too easy to confuse and can't be enjoyed while on the boat, while the former has no such problem!”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Margaret nodded with a smile. "Not only those businessmen, but even many explorers have noticed chaotic drinks. After all, they can keep warm and not have Drinks with side effects may save when they are in a shipwreck "We have a life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I suggest splitting different chaotic drinks into different prices," Etiha continued, "like this special effect. Products, with a little promotion, can sell higher prices – not to mention they still drink one bottle less.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is obviously It was used as a functional drink, and Roland glanced at him with a glance. Sure enough, the businessman who could be a big man in the fjord had a good marketing vision. With a small amount of samples, he realized that this is actually a varied and obvious difference. The general category of goods. For such goods, pricing separately for features is the best way to squeeze their value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the response is so good, then we can proceed to the next sale according to the previously signed contract," Roland said, "whether it is the order amount, or The proportion of sales in the district, these people should have no objection. However, the delivery of goods needs to prepay 30% of the purchase price, you should bring enough Jinlong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the main terms of the Chamber of Commerce It was negotiated years ago, so there is not much detail to be discussed. He invited Tilly to come here mainly to witness the result, to show that he did not make a hand in the amount of the share. After all, the other party not only promised to stay in the winter city without permission, but also promised to move the witches on the island to the west, and he also had to show his sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the "win-win gambling contract" of the evil month, whether it is the advance payment or the final sales amount, 30% will belong to the award fund, which belongs to the city hall and the witch alliance. And a total of sleeping spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, Your Majesty," Nieber opened his mouth. "This time, I didn’t even have a box of goods on board, except for the craftsmen and sailors. All that's left is Huang Cancan's coin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we will check the goods now," Roland smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beverage factory built for Evelyn is located opposite the alcohol factory, but Rather than being a factory building, it is more like a defensive warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
