			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took into account the role of the pill, and did not order the first army to pursue the first time, but sent lightning and wheat to monitor the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounded soldiers on the line of defense were immediately rescued. The whole battle came down. Only five people were injured and they were all shot by spears. Four of them were from artillery. team. It is gratifying to him that the enemy’s throwing spears approaching a distance of 150 meters did not let the artillery sneak away. Instead, they lowered their bodies and used the gun holder to avoid the spears and re-in the shortest time. Put into combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa stayed on the line of defense and stayed on the line, especially when the enemy turned around and fled, she ignored the rumbling sound of the fire, and took the Viscount of Tigu to the artillery position. To treat those injured by the spear. It's hard to imagine that she was still a dizzy little girl six months ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last five people have survived. In the cheers, many soldiers gave her a military salute and watched her leave the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this battle is much easier than dealing with the Duke’s coalition. Without drugs, the militias who are in addiction are extremely unbearable, and some even run. After two or three kilometers, I lay down on the ground and no longer want to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chase forces quickly gathered them all together and rushed to the Long Song Fortress. During this period, the First Army also captured two knights. Although they did not swallow the pills, they had lost the idea of ​​rebellion. In the face of the approaching pursuit, they simply chose to surrender and asked to write to the family. Get a chance to redeem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at the Long Song Fortress is four days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the interrogation of the Cavaliers to get the information, the nightingale easily disintegrated the troops left behind the fortress castle. The captain was killed on the spot, and more than a hundred militiamen were stunned and made a bird and beast. Then they fell into the ambush circle set by the First Army at the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s men found the imprisoned Pedro in the castle dungeon. He looked awkward, probably worried and anxious, but given the aristocrats of the Earl of Honeysuckle Identity, he did not suffer from non-human treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly three months, the prince saw the agent again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, it’s great to see you," Pei’s uneasy feeling finally relaxed, and he took all the things he experienced in these days. Say it again, "I don't know the messengers of Tefko..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are dead," Roland leaned back in his chair, "other The 1,500 people they brought, more than half of them died at the border of the town, and the rest are currently in the prison."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear the messenger When the news broke, Pei Luo appeared to be somewhat surprised. "His Royal Highness, if you do this, I am afraid that the new king... No, your brother will regard you as a nail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "So I should be shackled, return to the king, let him be at the mercy?" Roland's eyes looked directly at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter involuntarily bowed his head, "No, Your Highness..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From him From the moment he sent the troops to the West, it was already my enemy," the prince said quietly. "Tefico Wimbledon will only become more and more urgent in order to seize power. He urgently needs land and title. Those who support him. If you only want to enjoy, why should you manage this fortress for me? You should be very clear, only when I become the king of the Grey Fort, your position in the West can be stabilized into the mountains." He paused. Then, "In order to prevent this from happening again, I need to form an army to defend the fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Army?" Pei Luo stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s not a knight, but an army of civilians, full-time combat." Roland slowly said his plan, "You pick from the fortress." A team of three hundred people, my subordinates train them how to fight. The requirements of these three hundred people are: must be civilians, have not committed crimes, not church believers, between the ages of 16 and 30, no body Disability. During the training, they will live in Bianbu Town, and the weapons will be provided by me. Your knights and patrols will only be responsible for the city's law and order in the future. More details are written on it," he handed the other to a sheepskin. Paper, "You can post announcements for recruitment and screening as described above."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
