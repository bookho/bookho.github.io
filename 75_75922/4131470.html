			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the night, the entire camp fell into silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who have been busy all day have completely fallen asleep at this moment, and the witch is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning but not feeling sleepy at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day has been going on for almost half a month - or from the moment I left the forest, she felt an inexplicable uneasiness in her heart. The wound wounded by the wheat stubble also began to faintly hurt, as if reminding her of the day's experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning can't even tell if this pain is their own illusion. She tried many ways to distract her attention, but ended up failing. However, with the naked eye, the wound did not change, neither disappeared nor expanded, like a scarlet spot, stubbornly resting on her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of confusion makes her feel awkward, and she usually gets to sleep three or four in the morning. Even so, the short sleep will be one by one. When the nightmare is filled, it will wake up with a slight noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking to the side of the four-pronged occipital pillow on the hair, sleeping well, the sigh of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She re-closed the quilt that she had opened, but she sneaked down the floor and walked outside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch’s camp is located in the center of the camp, surrounded by a goddess of witches, who is in charge of warning. She does not want to be alarmed and flies directly from midair. Finally Landed on the track under construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiant moonlight filled the road under her feet, and the sides of the rails were like a silver rim; the evening breeze blew the wilderness over the curtains. Not only the friction of the shrubs, but also the birds called the insects. This kind of night scene has been used for a long time in the appreciation of lightning, but now she has no such thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t even dare to look in the direction of Taqila--the monster that was hidden in the dark earth seemed to be staring at her, as long as the line of sight passed, The scar on the chest will remind her of this fact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning looked at the foot of the foot and the back of the sleeper, a bitter bitterness in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a month of recovery training, she managed to overcome psychological fears before crossing the low-lying border wall of the Winter City. I thought that as long as she persisted, she would not be able to face the high-level devil of Takira again, at least to return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the result is ruthlessly crushing this idea - she is not only unable to use the awakening ability freely, she always feels confused when she is flying, even encounters ordinary The devil, she lost the courage of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, regardless of the enemy’s idea, she and Mai Hao can make the four madmen come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, now she dares to stay behind the enemy and wait for them to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that she dragged everyone’s hind legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, lightning can't help but feel a bit sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you hide it, you can’t ever pass everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it’s dull, like a wheat stub, I’ve recently felt that something is wrong with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, one day, she will squat herself and fly to a higher place alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should she do then? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am so useless," Lightning squatted and buried his head in his knees. "There is no qualification for the devil to scare the courage." Going to be the head of the expedition. They know that they will laugh at me... I always boast that I am the greatest explorer, and I am weaker than anyone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Yes, my heart seems to have a voice answering, they will laugh at you sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who makes you love to boast of Haikou, do you think it is? If you don't want to see their ridicule, besides leaving here, go to a place that no one knows, otherwise you can't avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only leaving...here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That can't be done." Suddenly someone said . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" The lightning slammed and slammed his head up, only to see a familiar figure standing not far away, under the white moonlight, The other's long ears and tail are particularly eye-catching. "...Luo Jia?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough--" The wolf coughed twice. "In advance, I didn't mean to overstate your self-proclaimed words." Self-talking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment she noticed that Luo Jia was full of sweat, and it was flashing and reflecting the moonlight, the wheat that is unique to the Mokins. The color of the skin is like the slate of the morning dew, which looks very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you just training..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I am not like extraordinary Those who are born with a powerful power, even if turned into a desert wolf, they need to rely on practice to strengthen themselves. Otherwise, don't mention the battle, even running a few steps is enough." Luo Jia spreads, "Recently the devil does not take the initiative to attack, I also promised that the chieftain would not leave the position without permission, even the basic amount of activity could not be guaranteed, and it could only be replenished at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? ..." Lightning suddenly came back to God. She took a deep breath and covered her face with her hands. "Have you all heard and heard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is fundamentally Without answering, the wolf's ears have always been extremely sensitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly felt her face getting hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That..." Luo Jiaton paused. "I have never comforted people, so I will not comfort you now. I just want to tell you a "About my father's story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "While he was born in the mad flame clan, he also inherited the name of the fire, but at that time no one thought he would become a family. Long. Because among the eight successors, he has a very obvious deficiency: he is afraid of being born, and does not dare to go out to participate in joint hunting. This is also a major activity that Mojinsha people regard as the selection of patriarchs. After all, the patriarch is not only internal. They also need to show their influence to the outside world. Each clan will send the most outstanding young generation to prove their strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning can't help but stop... ...has she not got it wrong? The fear of the other person in the mouth of the other party, not long ago, in the absence of the Winter City Games, but also caused the attention of Roland. Is it true that Luo Jia’s father actually has another person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, when he told me these things, I did not believe it at all, and I also found my grandfather to confirm," Luo Jia smiled and slowly walked over. She is around, "but the result is that these are true. When I asked my grandfather why he wanted to pass the patriarch to his father, he answered me and said that Gulze may not be able to do anything, but as long as there are people accompanying He is the most powerful warrior in the family. If this is the case, then it is better not to let him be alone. The clan is closely united, which is the normal state that should be the most part of it. What can a hunting prove?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning felt the heart tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, the father and the older brother did not do in the winter city... I am still very happy," Luo Jia lowered his ear. "Because my father made it for me." He can't do anything by himself... although it's a shame."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃, yes... is this the case? You obviously left them in the castle hall, and one ran back to the Witch Building, and said that they would never want to see them again - even though it was really inappropriate to meet them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think my grandfather probably wants to tell me that courage comes from both the heart and the others." Luo Jia said slowly, "since this is the case." Why do you care about your personal courage? Similarly, if the expedition’s partners are in crisis, will you give up and escape?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning is silent For a moment, "...thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, this is not comfort, just a story." The wolf woman turned her head, "So thank you In addition, the expedition is quite interesting... Since you brought me in, you have to be responsible for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
