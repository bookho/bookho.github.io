			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the roar of the first group, the first three aircraft left the airport one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which do you think will win?" asked Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Hey, do you want to gamble on chaotic drinks?" Hillvi was unsure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, just guess it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter seems to be relieved, "Then I Guess the second group, they are all selected from the first army, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true," Tilly nodded, "Cami "What are you pulling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter which side, my Royal Highness," Kamila Darry sighed. "Although this thing is really amazing, but In the past 30 years, the individual is equivalent to a dozen beasts. Even if it is doubled, the effect on the situation is still quite limited. I am afraid it is not worth your heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just now." Tilly laughed. "When I first came to winter, there were only a handful of factories on the banks of the river. You see it now extends to the port of Shoal. Besides, now The beasts and the four hundred years ago did not change, but these things only came out more than half a year, they have been changed several times, who knows what will develop in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nb Sp;&nbsp;"..." Carmela was silent. "I said you. But I still have to take care of the island. I have been here for too long."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am worried about you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Your Highness--"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Tilly said calmly. "You should have left without winter after the Northern Expedition, but because my problem has been left. Thank you, Camilla, I am now It’s okay.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big butler and her eyes are only a few seconds later, "I understand. But I can’t sleep alone, you can’t do it alone, you If you have time, it's best to go back and see. The left-wing witches are looking forward to your return."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...they still don't want to come No winter?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes. Some people are...they are hurt too deeply.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s only a small part, it also represents that paragraph Fishy brutal past did not completely eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe can never be eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I wait for the victory of the battle of God, I will go back." Tilly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the war can't win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the second group The plane whizzed across the runway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly did not answer, but smiled. "Training is over...come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, can you tell me that the Princess of the Long Princess can notice the movements of the six planes at the same time?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fingin is shouting behind the scenes. The air current is flowing against the fuselage, and the whistling sound is heard. If it is facing the sea breeze, the noise can almost fill the entire cabin. If you don't have to force it, you can't hear each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the matter of His Royal Highness, and His Highness has the final say!" Goode also replied. At this point he noticed that four of the six "numbers" on the far airport had turned green, indicating that the two groups were taking off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the inability to stay in college, the three planes of the group almost invariably chose to return to the sea. He can't see the movements of the 4th, 5th, and 6th machines, but there is no doubt that the opponents will definitely notice their route, so they will never immediately follow them. It takes time to climb and speed up, and rush into the first mover. The advantage zone will definitely put itself in a disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane slammed down a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrupted Finkin swears, "What the hell are you doing! Can you control the stability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am saving you, fool! If your Highness can see the sight, can you guess she can see your mouth shape? It is lucky to go to the mine to mine!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a close behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode looked around in the gap between the upper wing and the fuselage for a week, only to see that there is a black spot in the distance moving near the sea antenna, and the other Lost completely, obviously everyone chose to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to some basic ideas, His Royal Highness Princess did not teach how to do air combat, and everything depends on their own judgment. I hope that even the Highness himself does not know - after all, the empty knight is something that has never been seen before, and it needs to be groping from zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is no regulation, choose an open airspace, and find that the opponent is again contingent, it is also a safe response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought for a moment, turned the course and flew towards the shallow water port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"West, winding from the factory area Past!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“War? Is it better to wait for them directly here?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that's just an equal opportunity!" Goode yelled as he turned. "Think about how they will fly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not care about winning or losing However, the winner's flight time will obviously be longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I fly, wait for the height and speed to be raised, and then go to the sea to find us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, because I don’t know when the second group can be prepared, the first flight group can’t get accurate attack time, which makes them more inclined to defend the side, just like the knight who chooses the battlefield is waiting. The other party launched a charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a way for him to get the best first mobile phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is when the second group focused on the plane on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the open ground, it is often difficult for teams to escape the wide range of movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is not the ground, apart from the left and right, there are points up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If only we can see them, they can't see us, we can break the equal situation!" Goode said his thoughts aloud, "You don't think they will have less practice than us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, haha... it turned out to be like this!" Finkin patted him hard. Shoulder, "I thought I was already scheming. I didn't expect your kid to be more insidious than me! But I like it, just do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insidious... ...Do you praise me or yell at me? Goode rolled his eyes and lowered his nose and fell towards the sea. The height is quickly transformed into speed, and the fuselage is hidden under the sea cliff. At the lowest point, the wheels of the aircraft were almost flush with the top of the mast of the sea, and such low flying also caused the unanimous eye of the sailors on board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the plane passed over the port of Shoal, the dock even cheered and whistled! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reactions of the migrants were significantly different. They looked at the sky one by one, and they were terrified, and even a turbulent team appeared in the queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't fly too low, otherwise it will be slammed by the police department, and we will sweep the toilet for a month!" Finkin reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, this distance should be enough." Goode slowly pulled the joystick, and the plane jumped out of the horizon and broke into the factory area. This is equivalent to the west side of the airport, and there is a smoke column rising all the year round. It is unlikely that the second group will climb up here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
