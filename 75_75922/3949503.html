			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And me," the lightning rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to," Nana Va. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" McMillan followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland simply stood in the same place, letting all the members of the Witch Alliance hold it all together, and seeing Tilly couldn’t help but say, "You have a good relationship with them." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you also need your brother's hug?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, thank you," She smiled and shook her head. "I can still clearly remember the scene where you picked me up and fell to the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland had to shrug and say innocent, Then he turned his gaze to the woman in the arms of the gray--the other side had a sea-blue hair, and the age did not look big, and the figure was similar to Anna. Her eyes were closed, her slender eyebrows were slightly upturned, her skin was white, and the tears in her eyes were particularly eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Light from the outside, the other party is not like a prisoner trapped in the basement of the stone tower, but has a sense of sleeping beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But relative to the appearance, Roland is more concerned about her robes - in this era, he rarely saw such a beautiful and complicated costume, due to The lack of dyes, the background color of the violet itself is extremely rare, with the intertwined white stripes and embossing, it is like a gorgeous robe that can be seen in a movie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This must be an orange outfit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is she still alive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," said the nightingale, "but the body The magic has been exhausted, a bit like the situation that Anna encountered in adulthood. However, unlike Anna, her magic recovery rate is very slow. If it continues, it may take three or four days to reach normal level."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that case, let her sleeper first," Roland nodded. "I will clean up a room on the third floor of the castle to restore her. Others go back to the hall." "He paused." "I want to hear the story of your trip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the story of Tilly and the Nightingale, Roland couldn't help but pinch the cold sweat for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a full picture of Hilvi, it is still very dangerous to pursue a huge evil beast that has never been seen before, if it is your own. I am afraid I will hesitate. I didn't expect Tilly to be so decisive. I chose the right candidate in a short time and personally led the team to go... It can only be said that she became the leader of many witches not just because of the identity of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You thought at the time that this worm was related to the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't I know, but it’s not impossible,” Tilly said slowly. “The witches of the Aids have met the devil who is riding a mixed kind of evil beast. They are cut off the flesh and listened to the devil’s command. It’s a bit like taming. Livestock. Behind the snow-capped mountains, you also saw the beasts that can fly - completely different from the devil's form, perhaps another evil beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So can you speculate that the devil and the evil beast are subordinate, just like humans and hounds. Can they use some means to obey these commands and drive them to accomplish some of the more difficult tasks?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It feels like...there is such a thing," Roland nodded, but there was always an incomprehensible confusion in his heart. The evil beasts will only take the initiative to attack the human settlements when they are in the demon moon, but it does not mean that they can only live in the demon moon. The moss and weeds on the shell of the siege beast can prove that these monsters are enough to survive. For decades. If the devil is limited to the red fog and cannot quickly occupy the entire wild land and drive humanity out of the mainland completely, then they can constantly send evil beasts to harass the four kingdoms instead of waiting for the winter to act again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is...he can’t forget the combination of the wolf and lion mixed species that had attacked the iron axe in the first year of the demon month. Intelligence - Unlike the "smart" animals that are conditioned, it learns, analyzes, and chooses the course of action and goals that are beyond the reach of most creatures. If a mixed-breed beast that has lived for a long time has intelligence, it cannot be tamed by another race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
