			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adulthood of magic always comes at the moment of midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also an unsolved mystery of the witches - the magic is everywhere, why is it most active at this time. Even a witch like Anna, after the magic consumption is bottomed out, the first one or two hours after midnight can be restored to 7788. If the natural reply during the day alone, I am afraid I will not be able to make it back in a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, most of the witches didn’t care, even the remnants of Takira were no exception – when Roland asked them about it, the answer was It’s all about "A new day is not the case." In the eyes of most people, time is divided by day, the magic of the day is spent every day, and there is a new weather every day. It seems that there is nothing unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland knows that the date is not a natural concept, but that people create it for the convenience of life, so there will be a return year and precession. In order to correct this error, people have a month, and with the further accuracy of the timing method, there are then leap seconds (that is, 59 or 61 seconds in the last minute), in short, how convenient it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the witch always solidifies the magic in a certain time, it seems a bit embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like having a biological clock in every awakened person, and can keep the same tone at all times. No matter what year and month she was born, she is located in the extreme south or on the Hermes Plateau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately in the absence of observation tools, whether it is research magic, or accurate timing is difficult to achieve at this stage, he can only regard this phenomenon as Experience theory has been applied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty," Wendy’s words pulled him back from his thoughts. "Aside from the above measures, what else do you have to add?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called measures are mainly designed to deal with the dangers that may be encountered when the ability to cure - since the scene of Lucia’s adult day, the link has been included The consideration of the Witch Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point, even Tachella could not provide much useful advice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do as you say," Roland thought. "Right, don't forget to inform Margaret and Sand. Birds, I think they I also hope that I can see that lightning is a safe adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wendy has some accidents, "Ms. Margaret has no problem, but Mr. Bird..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He doesn't matter." Roland said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I understand." Seeing him, Wendy no longer asks, and will soon be down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the night, the top of the Witch Building is brightly lit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been transformed into a bedroom for witches to use in adulthood - a room made up of two sets of normal rooms can accommodate the next More companions, a wall has also become a push-pull movable door structure, in case you need to release the magic, you can directly open the two door panels, no longer need to open the outer wall like the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning lying on the soft big bed, it is very exciting, its performance is opposite to Lucia, it seems that in her eyes, long-awaited for this day . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fixed wooden table next to the big bed, her left hand is tied to it, and her hand is holding a sign of God. According to the experience gained from Lucia, whenever you feel the contraction of colic in your body, you can put all the magic into the mark. One hand was tied to avoid too much pain, so that the witch lost control and accidentally pointed the mark to others. After excluding the danger, the Earl of Speer was not at the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lightning around, has been surrounded by the former visiting partners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of branching ability will I wake up? If I can solve the weight-bearing problem, then I can bring a lot of food and tools. The whole scene will fly all over again!" A similar topic lasted almost one night. Her eyes flickered and listed one possibility after another. It looked like Roland when she guessed what kind of birthday gift the family would give. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, he is eager to get a big Transformers, but the last one is a 300-episode of exercises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There may be nothing," the mystery month muttered. "Which branching ability is so easy to obtain, count the number, no winter city." Personally, this talent is there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uh huh..." After this sentence, Roland seemed to hear a whisper of nasal noise, rising The tail is full of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have such a talk!" Lily glanced at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, the mystery of the month can not be wrong," Ai Gesha laughed. "The Federation has done statistics, and the witch can awaken the branch in adulthood. It’s a hundred miles. But it’s nothing compared to the promotion of Jin Jin. After all, the most important thing for a witch is the ability to have unlimited potential for expansion, so you don’t have to care too much, paying attention to the ability to cure. Just fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, aren't you making annual evolutionary analysis?" The book inserts, "What is the result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can only be used as a reference. After all, there are not enough examples to verify," Wendy took out the record book and looked at it. "But the lightning score is really high, with 85.9 points. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? What is that?" Andrea asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A method of evaluation," Ai Gesha explained, "is also a revelation from Lucia - because the surge of magic is evident in adult curing. In theory, it is indeed easier to form cohesion, so we made a preliminary assessment based on the state of all high-level witches as they were promoted, and scored according to the total amount of magic, subject score, ability control, and individual will. At present, it is only at the stage of conjecture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subject score...Do you mean test scores?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, and it has the largest proportion in the formula."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that it seems that someone can't be promoted in this life. Extraordinary," Andrea glanced at the ashes with mercy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter shrugged in disapproval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s... crazy," Roland suddenly heard a sigh from Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" He looked to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the era of Tacharia, high-level promotion is a very sacred thing for every witch, everyone is eager to get the gods I’m afraid, I’m never afraid to talk about it publicly. Because it’s too far away, if anyone declares that he’s going to be promoted, he’s sure to be laughed at by others. But now...” Felice snorted halfway It’s like coming back, “Sorry, I’m not saying that it’s not good, but the contrast between the two makes me think...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I understand what you mean "Roland smiled lightly. "It’s like a businessman who sleeps and finds that the golden dragon that has been accumulated for a lifetime is no longer precious. It is always difficult for people to adapt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "At this point, I am really not as good as Aunt Gesha," Felice whispered. "She only came here a year earlier than me, but now she has guided a new round of high-level awakening research. It is the genius of the federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, this is not difficult to understand, if future generations are no more than predecessors Strong, how can we improve?" He said calmly. "As long as we are still moving forward, such scenes will continue to reappear. If we see them, we will feel that this is hope or not -"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following his gaze, Felice also turned her eyes to the girl on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the ability is always as good as possible, isn't it," Lightning confidently filled. "I don't think I will not only gather magic, but also get several Branching ability, because the most outstanding explorers will surely get the most generous rewards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕-!" Raise your arms high, as if you are supporting each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
