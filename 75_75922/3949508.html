			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Roland put down the pen in his hand and looked up and quietly appeared. Nightingale in the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She fell asleep, just ate a bowl of porridge, and her appetite was not bad," she went to the table and sat back to her old position. "Now Change to Sylvie to monitor her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, this is fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you believe what she said?" asked the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The stone of the gods is taken down anyway. When you ask again tomorrow, you can tell if she is lying, but..." Roland paused for a moment, " I think most of what she said is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" she was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you discovered that a person four hundred years ago used the same language and the same language?" the prince said with his chin. It is almost impossible to say that the two regions are separated by a desperate mountain range - unless the two places themselves belong to the same origin and the exchanges are very close."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she can call the four kingdoms a wild land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the key... I don't know that it was one more than four hundred years ago. What kind of scene may be just a few villages, and some criminals who have been exiled to the world by the witch world. The history books of the kingdom also record that the ages of major cities are generally between two hundred and three hundred years, and the astrologers are from that "The times have come." He is full of interest. "I have always been very curious. Why are astrologers who have not made achievements and have no research results, and they are called "sages" with the alchemists? Now I probably understand - the federation Leading survivors to escape this edge and bring Their language and culture. These people are integrated into the locals to help them build political power, fortresses and cities. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaks like you see it with your own eyes." "Night laughs and shakes his head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The only way to explain why we use the same language with her," Roland said earnestly, "because we belong to the same origin." And in these four hundred years, civilization has been rebuilding, and there has not been any development. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," she said, "I can know the answer anyway tomorrow." If you guess wrong... give me a "luxury lunch". "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called luxury lunch is actually a combination of corn soup, roast chicken drumsticks and ice cream bread, which is only done once a week in the kitchen.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you guessing it wrong? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can do anything," said the night, half-squinting. Her cheeks and the clean neck were perfect. The curve is extraordinarily moving. If you look at the full score, no matter what action is tempting others, Roland has finally verified the correctness of this sentence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I wrote down," he coughed twice and turned his attention back to the paper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Aegis had just reawakened, Roland was not forced to force The other party answered all the questions accurately and meticulously, basically following her thoughts and thinking about where to ask, so the information she got was very confusing. The work he is doing now is to rearrange the news in Ai Gesha’s words, and Find out the key points to understand next.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most pressing issue is the devil.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reason for the war with the devil, why are they now dying again? The town is vital. There has never been a war for no reason, and the devil’s actions are not like aggression for resources and expansion: they do not occupy the wild land, nor plunder humans, it looks like a The field is purely for the purpose of killing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also noticed that the other party mentioned the word "war of gods", is it that the two sides are carrying out your life and death under the guidance of the gods? war? But at that time, the church did not even have a shadow. Naturally, there was only the only god they claimed. This was not explained. He could not feel at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
