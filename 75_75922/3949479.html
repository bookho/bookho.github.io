			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the arrival of the staff, Roland told the story of lightning discovery from beginning to end, "The transparent crystal enamel appeared in an ancient ruins, in a damp basement. There are no signs of **, the magic gem that keeps asking for help, and the devil who turns into a fly ash... What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to say, Could she be a witch?” Annasi said. “If she is still alive, maybe she can learn more about what happened more than 400 years ago.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "She may not be a witch, not even that era," the book hesitated for a moment, "and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And she does not necessarily stand by us Here," added the leaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence gives Roland a slight glimpse. Indeed, if the ruins are left by the church, the other party is probably a member of the church, gorgeous from the lightning Look at the clothing, maybe it is still a high-level. Ordinary people are okay, if it is a witch, it will be tricky to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the ashes and the nightingales, to the no-face attack, it can be seen that the fighting power between the witches does not have a clear dividing line. In the case of the stone, it is also possible to overcome the unusual witch of the ability, and the battle witch is assisted by the witch, the same situation is worrying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the unlikely event that the other party is malicious, no one can guarantee that her ability will not pose a threat to the Witch Alliance...unless within the influence of the Stone of Divine Penalty Wake her up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are all crazy, actually consider whether she is on our side?" Lily couldn't help her forehead, "four hundred years ago How could it be possible to live today? The witch is short-lived. Even if it is a supernatural person who has been strengthened, there is not more than one hundred years. You think too much. As I said, maybe the thing is broken, the people inside. Just like the devil, it turns into dust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Short-lived is because of the so-called demon phagosomes," Roland corrected. "Women's physical fitness is generally stronger than ordinary people. The actual lifespan should be longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The average person is forty or fifty years," Lily snorted. "You think everyone is as long as the turtle." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average life expectancy of 40 or 50 years is caused by poor food supply and low medical standards. As long as the quality of life goes up, it can rise again. Twenty years. However, she said that it is not unreasonable. Roland thought that even with these, there is still a long way to go from the life of four hundred years... Even if it is a tortoise, I am afraid it will not last long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she does seem to be alive," said Lightning. "You know, it's totally different from the dead demons, her skin is smooth, The lips are full of blood. Mai Mai!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Lightning is right!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok, don't argue," Wendy stood up and interrupted. "Whether she is dead or alive, it's worth trying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Ok?" asked the book frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In case she is really a church witch, just hang up the stone of God before she wakes up. And we still have Anna and the nightingale. It’s not a big problem to hold her.” Wendy said calmly. “The key is that she may know the accident that occurred more than 400 years ago. It’s worthwhile to go to the rescue.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that the intelligence of the devil is very important to the town, and the church’s efforts to hide the news are definitely bad for them. If you can master these in advance, maybe in the future. Take the initiative in confrontation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna and the Nightingale also agreed to Wendy’s opinion. As a result, even if the book was not properly prepared, it would no longer be opposed. The Witch Alliance basically reached an agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first army?" Roland looked at the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There can only be a maximum of 50 people," the latter said. "His Highness, you have sent several teams to assist the City Hall to recruit people from all walks of life. Now small There are only more than 500 soldiers left in the town. Although Tefko has been punished, he may still be desperate to launch a large-scale attack on the West. The First Army must leave enough manpower to guard against the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
