			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, after returning to the Cangshan Command Post, the Iron Axe entered the Office of the General Staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this trip?" Istis is sitting in front of the red wooden table, so I can drink black tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s clear that these days everyone is too busy, and it’s common to work until the early hours of the morning, but she still maintains a refined image, as if energy and time are inherently more than others. Out of a sudden, this kind of skill is even admired by the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Morale is available," he replied briefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we can proceed to the next step." Northland Pearl smiled slightly. "By the way, just last night, the defenders of the fine sand city also withdrew. Out of the defensive zone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only Shenchi Bay..." The iron axe looked at the big map on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suggest that they be evacuated as soon as possible and send a force to meet, no longer waiting for the line to break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe nodded and he agreed with this judgment. Nowadays, the devils gathered from west to east are likely to have more than 50,000. This number is not a problem to surround Shenchi Bay. Once the army meets, the first army may find it difficult to find a suitable time for retreat. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since their strategic goals are not on the top of a city, it is a natural decision to abandon the sinking pool in order to preserve the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the enemy launched a massive attack, the evacuation has never stopped. The residents and businessmen who originally maintained the city’s operation were first transferred to the city, followed by Roland. The family and the nobility. At this moment, the city is just a huge empty shell. As long as the order is given, the defender can move immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I... don't quite understand..." Ai Gesha, who looked at the latest battle report, muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the problem?" The iron axe came to her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gap between the number of casualties and the statistics of the enemy... is thirty times as much. How did this happen?" Because the four cities were in the past There are enemies in the week, and the reports are sent in batches, so manual summarization is required. In order to prevent miscalculation, she repeatedly checked the arithmetic in her hand several times, and the answer was still unchanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the results of the statistics, the four cities have been fighting for more than 1,500 casualties, and the number of enemies has been reduced to 50,000. This is completely incredible. To describe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in the era of the federation, Aegusa will not hesitate to think that this is a deliberate falsification and a false report, but she has fought many times with the First Army. It is unlikely that such a problem will arise under the system of multi-party verification. Even if you throw away the error of one or two percent, it will not change its essence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know that when the First Army was in the northern expedition, the devil army was only 20,000! At that time, they relied on the hundreds of kilometers of railways to build one fortress after another, and it took nearly a year before and after the victory of the Battle of Takira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time the staff’s strategy is simply to retreat, and in eight days, it has twice the results of the Fertile Plains? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she is full of confidence in today’s humanity, this result still shocks her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha thought that this war would be anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out," Isis chuckled after watching the statistics of the Ice Witch. "To be honest, the effect of this program slightly exceeded my expectations. However, this is not all the merits of the First Army. The cooperation of the Devil is also very important. Probably that ambush made Heckzod not hurt, so that it has no energy to control the details of the front line."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just for this reason?" Ai Gesha is difficult to channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know what you are wondering," Itis waved. "Looks like we just used a few withdrawals to get back to such a battle, the battle plan." It’s easy to sum up in one sentence, but it’s actually not the case. You stayed in the rear during the federation, and it’s normal to understand it. Simply put, only the current First Army can execute this. Tactics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
