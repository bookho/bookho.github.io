			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe fell ill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the second-lowest guy in the gang, and he became the weakest one after he was abducted. There was no problem on the night of the return from the square, but by the next day, the snake tooth found Joe lying on the hay and motionless, and the mouth was screaming, and the cheeks were scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He was eroded by the cold plague," Kwai touched Joe's forehead. "The head is hot."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...will you die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened his eyes and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold plague is an extremely difficult disease. Once it is dyed, it can only rely on the body to resist the past - people who are physically good will rarely Freezing, the general illness is all physically weak, so few patients can survive. For mice, infection with cold is basically the same as the death penalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went to Kanash," Snakes broke the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ask him to give more food to Joe," He stood up and stood up. "I heard people say that if you are cold, you can fill your stomach and your body is warm, the chances of staying in the past will increase a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He won't give you," the tiger claw shook his head. "We all know what kind of person he is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Maybe you will be beaten by him," Kwai will gather the hay together. "The mouse never nourishes people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joe is not a waste, Snake retorted, "He is also literate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Several, and what is the use for Kanash? What he wants is to play Those who can rob and can steal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Snake teeth bite and turn to go straight to the room of the no-tail manager. Even if he is beaten with a stick, he wants to give it a try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Kanash did not return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am lucky," when he brought the news back to his companion, the tiger claws whispered. "Otherwise, we may have one more care." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwai sighed. "When we are making bread, we will give Joe a point, let him eat more."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the snake tooth didn't feel lucky, he felt a little bit wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting the news to the bloody hand is less than half an hour. It was also understood as a countermeasure after not coming back last night, but today it has arrived at noon. How can I finish the discussion? And he still sneaked into the eyes while those who opened the door, and found that not only Kanash, but even his lover was gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take long for the gang to start distributing food, and Snakes noticed that this time was distributed by Kanash’s cronies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still half a piece of black bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After four days, Joe’s condition has not only improved, but has increased a lot. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was able to say cold yesterday, and today he can’t even say anything. The bright red face began to turn white, and the breathing sound became weaker and weaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We tried our best." The sunflower touched the belly and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gave half of the food to Joe these days. If not, he would not be able to support this time. The tiger claws, which have always been full of energy, have some weak colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a hundred mice gathered in the room began to talk about it, but it was only a matter of discussion. After all, the daily food is still being distributed as usual, but today's snoring is extraordinarily larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the day when relief food is distributed in the preaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went to the square," Snakes hesitated for a long time, finally biting his lips. "Bread is not enough for us to eat, if you can get a bowl." Hot porridge, Joe may still be able to hold on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you crazy?" Kwai gave him a look, "Don't forget how Kanash warned us. You really want to be stitched with a needle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The premise is that he knows that I sneaked, and now the Kanash people don't know where they are, maybe The city owner really wants to do it for them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But his men are still here, do you think they will be let go if you find it?" Tiger claws, "Don't stupidly stand there, you also tell me about him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going with you," the latter suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe this food has long been smashed Or, the nobles just want to behave, if they don’t eat at all, don’t they violate Kanash’s warnings?” The tiger’s claws licked his mouth. “And I’m so strong that I can run back and forth with Joe. It won't be long before Kanash is absent, and those cronies are shrinking in his room to roast fire, no one will notice us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This... ..." Kwai hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will stay here," Snake said. "If someone asks, there is a saying. Just say we have a diarrhea and go to shelter from the wind." The place is squatting, rest assured, it will take only a long time to get back from there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's alright," she looked around. "You are going." Come back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snake teeth and tiger claws slip out of the log, along the small The lane runs all the way, the snow rising from the feet soaks the trousers, the cold wind blows on the face, like a knife, but even so, the two did not stop. Panting to the square, they found that there were nearly a thousand people on the edge of the wooden platform! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actually is actually distributing porridge! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two quickly ran in the past, but they were stopped by two guards wearing brown uniforms. "From that side, don't push, don't intersperse, otherwise Cancel the eligibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth noticed that the center of the square did not know when to set up a wooden fence around the podium, people folded like a piece The long dragons, in turn, follow the path enclosed by the fence. Every other distance, stood guards with strange iron bars, they seem to be the defenders of order, and from time to time someone was driven out of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My friend is ill... can you help us, beg you!" The snakes fell in the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He was hungry for a few days, and he needed to eat!" The tiger claws followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What disease?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...the cold epidemic."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them reached out and mentioned the unconscious Joe. "Give him to me, you go to the queue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He knows the way back, right?" said another person. "Even if he is not clear, you can come here to find him." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room guard, the guard has already taken Joe away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" The two face each other. No one thought that the result would be like this. According to their thoughts, the other party would either be indifferent or they would let them bypass the fence and advanced to receive the porridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
