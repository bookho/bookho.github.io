			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called copper wire wrapping is to cover the cut copper wire with a relatively hard anti-corrosion coating, so that it can be used for the three without winter city. Through engineering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This procedure is easier than previous tube coatings, at least not as precise in thickness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soloya selects a good color card and turns the magic pen into a round tube. As long as the copper wire is swept from start to finish, the "pigment" will be firm. Knotted on a metal surface - by changing the ability to better perform magic, or the skills learned from Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, compared to Anna, who has perfected the magic control, there is still a huge gap between Soloya. She has witnessed the cutting of black ingots. The scene is not so much a job, but rather a dance... Three black fires are made into different shapes, cut into metal from different angles, cut into a number of identically sized parts, or directly cut out one. A complete machine. It is not difficult to remember the magic features of different lengths of black fire. It is difficult to maintain the magic output of multiple features at the same time when multiple black fires are processed together. If you want to do this, there is no difference between the magic and the limbs, and maybe even more flexibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is...vine?" Lucia stared at the color of the magic pen and asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accurately, it is a ten-year-old vine skin." Soroya explained, "It is difficult to be twisted, and it has a certain hardness." Very close to the requirements of His Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten years of life... Do you have requirements for the year when you collect them?". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," she couldn’t help but smile. "Young vines are obviously softer, and their ability to resist corrosion and heat is worse. In fact, no. Just the vintage, like wood, paper and cloth, the performance is different when wet and dry, so I need to record them one by one with a color card."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then add up, it's not more than a metal formula!" Lucia exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily," Soloya thought for a moment, "I don't say it in Elementary Chemistry, when the material composition changes slightly, Is it possible to make a great change in the characteristics? But when the wood is mixed with water and one and a half, the color card performance is almost indistinguishable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔With a pen, I can record the whole world," Lucia said. "It's an enviable ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and didn't answer In my heart, I think that Anna’s ability is truly enviable. If the magic pen is only to record the world, then the black fire is creating this world. Most of the changes in the town today are related to Anna, and the seven or eight machines placed in the corner of the yard are proof. As long as they are connected to the steam engine, they can explode a powerful force, and the workers become an extension of the black fire through the machine. In a sense, Anna's creation allows ordinary townspeople without magic to have the power of a witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrap all five bundles of copper wire, and today's work is completed - Soroya's work is very regular, every day goes to different places to complete a part of the painting With the content of the painting, the painting speed is greatly increased, and the magic power can be consumed in about half a day, and then the free time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the magic is exhausted, the witch will be extremely tired and even fainting, so the daily training consumption will be controlled at around 70% - if it is normal, she will choose to continue Collect color cards to capture more novel colors, and also serve as an additional supplement to further increase the magic consumption. However, these days Wendy and Roland are not there, and Soroya can't afford to come up. I want to go and decide to go to the mystery month and they will fight a few venue owners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely not lazy, just make a temporary relaxation, she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time for playing cards is always going fast, and it’s gone in the blink of an eye. After dinner, the book announced an unexpected news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tonight's course cancellation, changed to the ability test for echo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诶, Has her ability been determined?" Lily wondered, "why is it now--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
