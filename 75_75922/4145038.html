			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is very impressed with the chief astrologer, not only observing etiquette, but also being very enthusiastic about his duties. Although there are not many trees in the field of star-gazing, the mathematics institute has done a lot of work. It has cultivated a large number of talents for the winter city. It is also involved in the overall calculation of the various departments of the administrative department. It can be said that the astrological association is in him. Under the leadership of this, a little bit of reversing the past, the name of Xianxian, but no influence, the weight is almost equal to the Alchemists Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day when the Red Moon was first born, the Dingxing Star also failed to give an early warning, and came to the door three times and five times to plead guilty. However, Roland was too busy to deal with the unexpected events in the winter city, and directly let the guards send the other party back. After all, no one can expect that this thing will come so suddenly, not to mention that he did not really expect the astrological association to discover the red moon from the beginning. It is nothing more than fancy that they can write it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People like this have actually used the word "must", and their findings are unusual. When Roland hangs up the phone, he immediately takes the guards and arrives at the mathematics parlor in the south of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called star-gazing station is just a loft in the mathematics parlor - before the astrologers have moved to the top of the miracle building, it has temporarily become They are temporarily watching the stars. Of course, because the spectacle construction time exceeded expectations, in order to avoid the difference between the original pie and the actual treatment, which caused a psychological gap, he also made several large-caliber astronomical telescopes for these people, and the top of the attic. Transformed into a professional star-gazing place that can be rotated freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the hospital, the Bachelor of Stars has been waiting for a group of astrologers for a long time, seeing Roland come, everyone kneels down on one knee, "to meet your majesty!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up," Roland waved his hand at random, indicating that the matter was important. "No more gossip, what did you find out?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, please come with me." The old bachelor solemnly led him to the top of the attic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door, Roland saw that the floor of the room was covered with calculation drafts and hand-drawn line drawings. According to his shallow astronomical achievements, it should be The trajectory operations of some stars. In fact, the astronomical knowledge he knows is enough to start licking each other. After the transfer of elementary physics and mathematics, these people have been studying on the subject for nearly two years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the Dingxue Bachelor, other astrologers did not follow, but stayed out. At the moment of closing the door, Roland captured a very serious look from the faces of those who had gray hair, as if the next thing to say was no different from the last words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland..." The nightingale couldn't help but pull his sleeves secretly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded quietly, and there was a nightingale behind him. He didn’t worry about what would happen, but he was extra curious and what was the discovery. This group of astrologers are so cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, these days, everyone has been observing the trajectory of the Red Moon and the changes it brings." After a moment of silence, the diffuse star finally began to speak. Since we can't accurately predict its arrival, we at least hope to make some compensation, such as determining the star area and size it is in. Otherwise, the mission given by the Astrologers Association at the beginning is meaningless. But the results we get these days. It’s terrifying.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frightened... Roland frowned, which is not like a word that can be associated with discovery. "What do you mean? Focus on it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Bachelor Pressing down the voice, "Your Majesty, the Star of the World is probably a scam, the Red Moon... It doesn't exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but hold his head and turn around Looking out the window, the scarlet sphere is still hanging high in the air, and there is no intention of dissipating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that something...doesn't exist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" When I first thought of this conclusion, I also felt a little funny, but as the observation continued, no one laughed in the astrological association.” The diffused star took a deep breath—when he opened his head, he felt like a rest, and the words were It’s a lot smoother. “Yes, your Majesty, it doesn’t exist. Based on the observations accumulated over the past 100 years and the knowledge you have taught, we can conclude that such a huge star cannot affect other stars.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
