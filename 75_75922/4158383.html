			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change of attitude and concept of the two devils is far more than a God-made god who has turned into an island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the spark that was quietly ignited at the foot of Mount Hermes, the offensive of the West Line Army was completely stopped because the source of the red fog ceased to exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are still some remaining territories in the desolate mountains, they will be permanently silent when the magic is exhausted. This has caused the pressure on the first army to be fortified to drop sharply, and the cage mountain is no longer the "life barrier" that must be preserved in the north. In the following week, many troops gradually withdrew from the front line and turned to support the western battlefield without winter. The situation that was stretched everywhere was suddenly alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large number of supporters who have the power to make the West’s offensive and defensive moments reverse. The newly formed tank troops on the ground are rampant in the evil beasts, like the screens. The beasts are encircled, and when the evil beasts gather on a large scale, they will be hit by the empty knights. The bunkers of the railway nodes that had no choice but to give up were gradually retaken, and the bodies of the mutant beasts that died under the guns were almost everywhere - if they were not corrupted into black water, the whole development site would be The stinking wreckage is full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although according to Wakiris, the evil beast is just an evolutionary field in the heavens and the sea, and its role in the war is extremely limited, and the real danger is still behind, but Re-stabilizing the situation is undoubtedly especially important for the absence of winter city. Since the devil's defense line has completely fallen, and the large-scale landing of the Tianhai world is an inevitable result, it is even more necessary for the First Army to concentrate its efforts on one point instead of spreading it out and fighting at both ends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was relieved while also starting a "rescue" to Eleanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the birth tower, the obelisk transplant has always been the responsibility of the mask, but after so many years, the three monarchs have more or less I heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core link is naturally the transformation of the mother of the soul, so that it can be integrated with the new vein. This technique is only known for the masks and the high-ranking promoters who follow it, but Eleanor's body is completely finished, so this is just the part that can be skipped directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second mother of the soul must be strong enough to restore activity after transplantation. This point is also very easy to understand, the transplant is no different from the bones of the mother, just like trees. Now the object is replaced by Eleanor, and he can only do what he can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is that the mother of the soul must not leave the red fog, that is, before the obelisk begins to transform red fog, it must be in a foggy in environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the hardest part of the entire rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Heckzod will be involved in the action - its twisted door is logistical, it is self-evident The occasion can fully exert the extraordinary effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After making a good plan, the first to enter the industry is the Ministry of Industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to salvage Eleanor from the foggy lake, you must first find out where she is. Inside the God of God is a restricted area where the witch can't get involved. The wetsuit invented by Rex has achieved unexpected miraculous effects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the suspension cable, more than a dozen sandmen wearing wetsuits walked into the foggy lake several times along the tower body, and finally determined at a depth of 150 meters. Eleanor's position, the leader is a man named Simbadi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to rely on manpower to strip the mother from the obelisk and tie it tightly with a rope. Under normal circumstances, the mother of the soul is comparable to the carrier, and is closely connected to the bottom of the tower, almost inseparable. The apocalyptic apoptosis has made this move feasible. Even if they do not take measures, the tower will gradually fall apart and eventually become a gravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mother lifted to the height of the lake, the Lord of the Scorpio opened the twisted door from below and introduced Eleanor into a special iron box. Along with her, there is naturally a lot of red fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this step, everyone is relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, things are much simpler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Heckzod’s insistence on leaving, Roland would like to seal it as a transport captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the gaze of all the feared witches, the iron box was swallowed by Fulan and sent to the bottom of the Beiposhan mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means that the entire rescue operation has come to an end - under the coordination of the Central Executive Office, it has mobilized nearly 10,000 people, even more The race completed the fire route that spanned half of the gray fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Roland can only wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North Slope Mine, Shenshi Mine Area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa rolled up a can of red mist and carefully poured it on the roots of an ugly monster - it was like a pile of soft mud over the tentacles, overhead There are two rows of compound eyes embedded in the upper symmetry, and the body is as large as the three central carriers. Even if you don't use the balance magic stone, you can feel the powerful magic hidden in the monster body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This devil, known as the mother of the soul, is the key to the transformation of the sacred stone column into a red mist tower. It is said that only in the world, the magic reaches its peak. It is only when the war of divineity is opened. Therefore, before the transplant technology was obtained, the devil could only wait quietly for the opportunity before the red moon. If Pasha had the opportunity to kill a mother in the period of the federation, she would not hesitate to give up her life, but now she cares for the mother of the soul like a child, and this contrast even her. I feel quite subtle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You really are here." A familiar voice came suddenly behind him. "How is her situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa turned his head and bent down to the Lord. "There is no sign of awakening, squatting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is Roland - except Outside Tachila's surviving ancient witch, he is the most diligent person to visit Eleanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the migration is a real thing." Roland sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I heard that Celine said that Eleanor had promised." There was not much frustration in Pasha’s tone. "As far as I know." She rarely makes promises, but once she exports, she has the words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope so..." Roland nodded slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After watching the moment, Pasha broke the silence, "Thank you, Your Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You have been thanked many times." He was a little helpless. Since the ancient witches knew that the three seats and the companions who were engaged in the central carrier were still alive, the reaction could almost be described by boiling, he also got Everyone is grateful. However, Pasha does not seem to be satisfied with a thank you, and he will say it almost every time he sees him. "Eleanor has great credit for the Grey Fort. I am only responsible for saving her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not just this thing, but Everything you do for everyone - no matter how many times I say thank you, I can't express this gratitude, so... let me say a few more times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; This slightly emotional discourse is hard to hear from Passa, and even Roland can't help but for a moment. He looked at Pasha on his head and seemed to want to see the other side's look from the quietly falling tentacles. I didn't expect this to make his heartbeat slower and half beat, almost no screaming -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the symmetrical eyes on the mother do not know when it was all Opened, I was quietly looking at the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are hundreds of years old, this wayward word is really amazing..." A new voice appeared in my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa slammed and slammed, and then the Lord had to cover his face, "Ah, Eh, Eleanor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, it’s me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa suddenly erected the Lord, and slammed himself to the top of the cave Then disappeared into the mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
