			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...how is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 76th, I only felt a bang in my heart, and the whole person stayed in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colorful Magic Stone feels that the range of magical fluctuations is limited. In theory, after more than one hundred steps, the orange light phenomenon cannot be observed. She did not intend to What is the distance to observe, the flat ring is just a matter of heart, but... Why is this happening? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking a deep breath, she blinked and put the ring in front of her eyes again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light column still has not disappeared - what she sees is not an illusion, but a real vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An indescribable excitement rushed to the mind, making her almost impossible to self-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Pasha, what kind of talent is eligible to be called the winner?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See the edge of the ring? If the beam can fill the entire field, then she It is the chosen person we are looking for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is too exaggerated, even Eleanor can only occupy more than half of the field." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So the potential of that person is more than the three seats of the Federation. I admit that it is very difficult, but apart from this road, we have no other way - remember Living, the key does not represent the size of the magic, nor is it equal to the level of combat power, so don't miss any witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edge? Filling the field of vision? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... Pasha, the miracle I saw far exceeded all this, and on the 76th, I swallowed, even if I put the ring closest to my eye. Location, and still can not be included in the magic stone. Its width transcends the boundaries of the field of view, and the ring must be translated to be able to see the full picture of this huge wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods finally smiled at humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nataya, you are right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the winner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When Roland yawned into the bathroom, he saw Jieluo washing in front of the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... toothpaste?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"喏." Little girl slightly let go Position, handed him a piece of toothpaste that is going to be used up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Roland shot a glass of water and stuffed the wet toothbrush into his mouth. Looking at the high and low ones in the mirror squeezing in front of the narrow sink, simulating the elbows, he suddenly felt that the dream was full of joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Lai spit out the foam in his mouth and gave him a white look. "What are you laughing at?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Laughter you are short." Roland replied with a nasal voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calf was kicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember to shave your beard, or it will be too old," she said, picking up her white hair and starting to ponytail. "Don't lose face to me today." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isn’t it a parent meeting?" He sighed and rinsed his toothbrush. "I am not your real family, just an agent, you don't need it." Formally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And want to officially not officially, the clothes in the closet are all stalled, it is not bad to be able to dress up in a spirited manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I still think that your long hair looks better," Roland snorted. "Even if you want to tie it, it is more suitable." Oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he was introduced to the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that after the end of the summer, Xiaotou’s temper is getting longer... Is it too much to condone her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With multiple dreams, Roland has now mastered the trick of dreaming. In other words, when he does not want to enter the world of dreams, this weird dream is not Will appear. Of course, he will not do other dreams, but will sleep directly to dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, he can more easily control the passage of time in the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than two months, in addition to further exploring the holy city of Hermes, Roland’s remaining work is to hang out the various libraries and search for those who stay. Impressive books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, he found that the strange power flowing in the body still works even in the memory fragments, because of this, his snowfield adventure is more than originally imagined. It is much smoother. Using the rock climbing rope and puncher that he bought, he even went deep into the sacred organs at the bottom of the cathedral. Although he did not find the prayer room in Isabella's mouth, the secret history records and the magic in the library. Stone research also opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he couldn’t use the secret road to the old holy city. The road disappeared without a trace, and there was only endless darkness at the end. And the red lightning, as if the other head has been swallowed up by the void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Jielu’s defeat is still with strong resistance, which leads to the remaining memory fragments only retaining the narrow area of ​​the new holy city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relying on the sale of armor removed from the Holy City, Roland’s deposits are rapidly increasing. The living room was finally air-conditioned, and the refrigerator was replaced by a larger one. The living conditions of the apartment building were significantly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, trouble is not without it. In order to rescue Jieluo, the appearance of running on the street has been photographed by many passers-by, not only on the Internet, but also on the Internet. Got a local news channel. Fortunately, no one clearly photographed his face, and he treated the suit as garbage in time, and he was not seen by Jieluo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for who is suspected of being a martial artist, why did he wear such a casual vest shorts and even appeared on the Internet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The view of Roland is...cough, I am sorry for the lack of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I don’t have to worry about life, he naturally turned his attention to other households. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to know if these people’s rooms also have the same door to the pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easiest way to get rid of scams is to use money to knock on their doors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am ready, uncle, let's go to school," after the cleansing was done, she walked up to him with her bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is September 12, the day of the new semester, parents need to be accompanied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but shine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has put on a black short sleeve, plus a knee-length pleated skirt, underneath white stockings and sneakers, looks youthful. people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft white hair bundle becomes two ponytails on the shoulders, and the yellow hair band hangs on both ends, with impeccable facial features, delicate and translucent The skin and the light red eyes are like the elves that come out of the painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but reach out and lick her head. "This is right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I just want to tie up such a scorpion, not what you said -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I know."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's true!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't say it was fake."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
