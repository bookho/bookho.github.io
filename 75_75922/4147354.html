			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sample form is attached to this clause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the basic information of the merchant, it seems that the sale of the goods must be indicated. Victor carefully looked through it several times, and suddenly there was an electric light in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that! His gaze quickly moved on the fourth and fifth, gradually capturing the meaning of the two rules - tax! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like most cities, there is no exemption from commercial tax on the plain side of the winter city, but the actual situation is not taxable. He has always paid taxes on a real basis, but among businessmen, the phenomenon of tax evasion can be said to be more common, but like him, it is a different kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants who bought the fixed storefront also paid a part of the money in a nominal way, and the merchants who rented the store or walked around were basically worthless. Compared with the patrols that have been extorted and eaten in the past, there is no stable and relaxed environment for the winter city. For small businessmen, there is no difference between the trading cities of Jinsuicheng and Xiongying City with zero taxation, and even more Well - it is this condition that has enabled the new king to develop a prosperous market in a very short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it seems that this situation will not continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declaration can be exempted from handling fees, but you must also put your own income source together. If the Executive Office deducts taxes according to this, no one will have any words. Can be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is no way to avoid it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously there is still. As long as you don't exchange the new currency for Jinlong, you can make up for this loss by directly purchasing the goods without the winter city and then selling it to other places for sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is just a make up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is familiar with this situation. No one can guarantee that income and expenses can be exactly equal. If you want to keep your business going, the new currency will generally be better than There are more old coins. They either go to the Executive Office to redeem them, or save them for the next time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time interval is long, it will gradually become such a situation: many businessmen will hold a certain amount of paper money in their hands, since it can actually buy things, It is convenient to carry and exchange between merchants sooner or later. At the beginning, it is only equivalent to redeem Jinlong, but it is not possible to buy it directly afterwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means that no matter what choices a businessman makes, it is good for no winter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point is that it is not difficult to do this, and it is difficult to take into account the feelings of the businessman. The lords who used to kill in the past are numerous, but these policies without winter have not substantially harmed the interests of traders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Registration can provide taxation for cities, thus creating a better trading environment, considering that legitimate operators often receive preferential policies, and generally will not Too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants who have been holding the banknotes are not much different from the past, they can still avoid taxation, and disguise the banknotes farther away in disguise. . As long as there is no substitute for the goods in the winter city, the new currency will occupy the position of Jinlong a little bit, even if it is not under the jurisdiction of the king of the gray castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor notes that in fact more than the last two, the New Deal reveals a gentle taste throughout, and the subtle shift is its biggest specialty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that as long as the king of the Grey Fortress controls the food transaction in the territory, the new currency will have value, even if there are no lack of policy-driven factors, The main reason is still the vast market without winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleeing businessman may not have thought about the meaning of these clauses at all - because of the fear of currency reform and the abandonment of such a potential market, it can only be said to be short-sighted. Lift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idiot that he thought was a dream, but now it seems that it is not as ridiculous as expected. As long as it is properly controlled, Roland Wimbledon may indeed be able to take it. Do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the thoughts, Victor couldnâ€™t help but shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
