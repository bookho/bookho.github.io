			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Bianbu Town is exceptionally different from previous years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the Demon Moon in the past year, you have to wait another month in the slum of the Long Song Fortress, and wait until the snow is completely clean before you can step back home. Return home. When I returned to the town, most of what I saw was a mess. The houses that have not been taken care of for several months have been ruined. Some unsound wooden houses have long been crushed by heavy snow. Some townspeople even hide from evil beasts, biting the cabinet tables and not dragging them. The straw rags are filled in the corners, and it is obvious that this place that can shelter from the wind and snow is used as its own nest. They often spend a week repairing their houses and replacing the moldy furniture. As for the long-lasting spoiled taste, the residents here are used to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this year, Bianbu Town can be described as a new look, the snow is quickly swept away, and the colored paper flag issued by His Royal Highness is hung at the door of the house. From afar, the monotonous and run-down towns have become colorful, and the various flags are mixed together, like the ocean of flowers. Everyone rushed to tell, the first day after the end of the demon moon, His Royal Highness will hold a grand celebration ball in the square! Anyone can go, not only do not need to pay coins, I heard that there are free food distribution! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the dance party? It’s a social occasion where the upper-level aristocrats can participate. Everyone has only heard about it in the well-known big city business, but even They are, and they can't participate. Listening to business people said that it is not an activity that can be invited if you have money. The prince of the prince actually let everyone participate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you are doing this, not so good?" The Chief Cavalier discouraged, "There are no bands, no dancers, no one in the rhythm of the dance." Control? Again, this remote place, even the nobility will not necessarily dance, your people will only mess everything up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter only went to a dance party in Wangdu, which was held by a Marquis to celebrate his daughter's birthday. Elegant strings and heated drums sway, ladies dance under melodious music, and men show their fast and powerful dance steps, or spins, or kicks, to join the drums. During the break, the waiter drove the drinks and snacks in the crowd, and the men looked for their favorite women. When the last piece of music was played, they took the courage to invite them. The winners were scattered after the dance. There is a wind and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter sighed, although the young man at the time couldn’t get to the favorite girl, but the elegant and romantic atmosphere still makes him feel good. Replace the nobles who are superior in style with the villagers who deal with stones and beasts every day? God, he can't imagine such a scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leading dancers? Yes," Roland ordered the militia to dismantle the stone sculptures and gallows in the square. "The iron axe and the militia are." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sandman?" Carter stunned. As the captain of the firearms team, the performance of the iron axe in the demon month is finally recognized by the chief knight, and the alien title is no longer mentioned, but the other party is the Mojin people, how can they know the etiquette of the mainland kingdom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smiled mysteriously: "Because I am not holding a dance in the usual sense, you will know it by then."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparations to be done are not too many, mainly to dismantle the obstacles in the square, and then build a firewood pile in the center. On the side of the woodpile, the table was raised with bricks for barbecue food. That's right, this is the celebration ball that Roland has come up with in his head - a mixture of bonfire party and wild barbecue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is used to increase people’s sense of identity with their place of residence has always been a matter of serious consideration by the prince. Nationalism and nationalism are too esoteric for those villagers who have worked for the lord for a lifetime, and who don’t know one big character. Only their family wealth and pro-people are worthy of concern. The more backward it is, the shorter it is. This is the law of the development of civilization. "Civilization will always become as big as its thoughts." Roland is deeply impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean that spiritual construction can be neglected. Victory celebration is one of the transformation methods he pondered. In fact, he was uncomfortable with no celebration of the world after the demon moon. The annual evil beast invasion is just like the natural disasters. It is worthy of this evil. It is naturally worthy of a book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he decided to name the first day after the end of the evil month every year as Victory Day. All the land that belongs to him, this day is not only a public holiday, but also a variety of celebrations. As long as it lasts for three or four years, it will become a tradition and will be passed down on the territory. The people will gradually feel that they are different from the people under the control of other lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
