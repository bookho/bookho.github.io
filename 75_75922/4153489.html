			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am fair, not the number, but the rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Del The tower leaned over and picked up the cracked mask, and put it back on the face again - the cracks worn by the sword hole merged into one, and finally disappeared without a trace. Not only the mask, but also the broken clothing and body, and returned to its original state after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under the same rules, the creators cannot be protected by the extra sphere, and God can only fight with a strength no higher than the world ceiling. This is Equity in nature. As for the number of people, or the pros and cons of the situation, it is entirely the result of my careful planning. How can it be unfair?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh..." Fiji wiped his mouth and said, "I don't think it would be a part of the rules to be worn by the sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, this is indeed the rule that is engraved into the bottom." Delta opened his hands and walked towards her step by step. "It’s strange to blame. It is a betrayal of God and left behind when creating this world." A small back door - only the creator and the gods can kill one god. You can hurt me, but these injuries will eventually be repaired by my magic. This battle is destined from the beginning. The result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you will mention "洁萝?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accurately speaking, it is to guard her before the formation of the crack. Now there is no shelter in the world, she is just a common awakened person. "Oh," said Delta. "You can ask this question, saying that you are not the same as those of the logical consciousness. Where did you hear the news? Since you know that you are from nothingness, why should you struggle?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is nothingness, what is real, do you think this is really important?" Fiji whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no fixed answer to this answer, you How do you know that you are not another emptiness?" She raised her sword and once again filled the body with the power of nature. "But for me, there is no more real world than this!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just--I don't know what it is." Delta snorted and raised his hand to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she does not retreat, greet each other's momentum and sway! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two forces collided together, making a deafening roar, and the turbulent airflow even flew out the overturned vehicles - in such a battle, It is a region that enters the two hands, and it is likely to be fatally injured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God did not have to say that there were many breaks in his body, and it was erupted by the genius of the martial artist when he died. The silver light cuts off half of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as it says, even such an amazing injury can't stop it. As God grasps his body with one hand, the wound that extends from the shoulder to the chest slowly closes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing the cold but not doing this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if her momentum is stronger than before, the wounds on her body are still increasing, from small scratches to deep visible bone scars, the situation seems to be Gradually deteriorated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo couldn’t help but hold his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly understands why she knows that she will be injured, and Fiji is not willing to take a half step back. She has to choose a hard-hitting approach to face it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s all because of yourself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the possibility of injury, you have to avoid the reality and find out the other side's flaws before you shoot. The attack made by God is reflected in the hand, and it is not impossible to predict in advance by her skill. If there are only two people in the crack, her attack will be more flexible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now the Fijian language is cold but can't do it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the heart of Jieluo involuntarily tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent God from having a slight injury to himself, Fiji Han gave up the illusory play and used the most violent offensive to force the enemy. Firmly clamped in the center of the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the injury she suffered at the moment is for herself -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The little girl felt her nose suddenly sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After she awakened, she also had a basic understanding of the strength of the body. The reason why Feiyu Han still looks like it is still the result of the natural force. It’s just that this power doesn’t relieve pain, and there are limits. She can’t fight like this all the time. In the end, it’s either crushed by severe pain or exhausted by the power of light. In either case, it will cause irreversibility to the body. s damage! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... Don’t fight anymore, she wants to shout out, but she can only make a fine whimper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a full sweep, and with a crisp sound, the long sword used by Fiji’s cold is knocked and shattered. Before she could find the new weapon, she was caught by the other side and thrown up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the power of the air, even if the skill is superb, it is difficult to control the trajectory of the fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below, God has long waited for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost a thunder-like straight punch, the latter suddenly flew tens of meters like a cannonball, slammed into the ground, and After more than ten laps, I stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the white light on Fiji’s body was dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to climb up, but she has not succeeded several times. The blood slid down the cheeks and soaked the clothes with the sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo couldn’t hold back and rushed out of the hiding place. All the way to the face of Fiji. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave me away!" However, the other party screamed Let the little girl who just wanted to raise her body tremble fiercely. "Go where you should go before, cough... don't get close to here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time in Fiji's cold face, an anxious look was revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I... ah---" Jielu had not come and answered, and he was covered by the invisible hand and lifted into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Catch you." God made a hand and a hand was preparing to swing. At this moment, the Fijian language is tight, and all the forces of nature are poured into the legs, desperately hitting the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud bang, the two stick together and roll out together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo also fell from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can be worthy of thirty minutes in such a battle. Your strength is indeed commendable, but what does it mean to continue to do it?" The martial artist who can’t move can be sent to himself. “You should also know that the emergence of this world is just a mistake. It is like a flower in the mirror, a moon in the water, opening and standing. It is a thought of the founder. I I don't think that he will treat you as a kind--everything you pay is just a joke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished in a continuation of heavy blows The flesh and blood are blurred, and the two legs are completely broken due to the reckless burst. The shoulders and right arm of the frontal impact are like being swept by the giants. The opened skin is separated from the bones, which is unbearable. Even so, she is still trying to raise her mouth and look at each other with a bird's eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I... said, what about it? I can't... choose the world I grew up with, but I can at least choose... to act according to my own will. And what about you, besides...the gods, what are you left? I’m afraid you haven’t seen the real appearance of the gods...” She gasped. “Under the circumstances, I don’t think the founders will follow. You think the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
