			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cement ship was placed in the maintenance room for a week and finally arrived at the day of the installation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stunned worker was dumbfounded. When the prince was forced to push the bath that was hard to make into the water, everyone wondered if he had got it wrong. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland’s order is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made the temporary removal of the shed, then dug a slope at the bottom of the cement boat and went straight into the river. This part must be done with extra care, because the tensile and shock resistance of cement products is extremely poor. It is a trivial matter to make a few cracks. If you hit the ground, it will be white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upper rolling, bundled rope to control the speed of the slide, when everything is ready, the workers will wrap the thick hemp rope around the newly laid stake and pull it into a straight line. With a sound password, slowly loosen the rope, and the bottom of the boat slides on the rolling wood, making a harsh rubbing sound. Fortunately, everything went well. Roland saw the cement ship gradually falling into the river. The whole ship was draught about half a meter deep, and the ship's wall still had a meter or so of water. The workers were surprised to see that this thing that was more sinking than the stone did not sink into the bottom of the river, but floated on the water like a leaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly wrap the rope around the stake for a few more turns, then tie it tight!" Roland commanded. The hemp rope tied to the hull cannot be untied, otherwise the cement boat will drift southward with the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the nightingale did not show up, but the incredible tone has revealed her shock: "Why can it float?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... In short, its average density is lower than water, and it will float on the water," Roland replied after a moment, "as to whether it is iron or not. The relationship between cement is not big. In fact, you should understand that when you see a sailboat, a big ship can be heavier than a stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is not ringing again, he Guess the other party has been in a bitter thinking. Even Anna, may not be able to react immediately. Roland smiled and continued to direct the workers to the next step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The follow-up is a long period of time. When the snow is heavy, the work has to stop. Only when the snow is small, can you rush to do the time. For a while. The main content of the armor is to lay the deck. The planks that are cut out of the tongue are installed on the ship. There are many short piles supported by the gap between the deck and the bottom of the ship. Although it is a waste of space, considering the cement ship The main use, no matter how much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is anti-corrosion treatment. At this point, the carpenter knew exactly what to do. They first applied a layer of oil with a pungent smell to the deck, and then repeatedly applied several layers with red paint after consolidation. After the deck is completed, the armor enters the superstructure installation phase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called upper part is nothing more than a wooden shed between two masts for storing artillery and ammunition. In the event of rain, the crew can also have a place to shelter from the rain. The top of the wooden shed is also equipped with a platform for one person to stand up, apparently for Wendy. As long as she stands on the roof, the ability to display the range can cover all the sails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rudder of the stern is melted from pig iron, which is slightly troublesome to install. It is necessary to pass the tiller from the underwater through the reserved hole to expose the deck. Insert the iron ring from the deck and weld the buckle. The buckle is a right-angled triangular iron plate with the long side welded to the tiller and the short side freely rotatable in the groove reserved for the iron ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The welding work was handed over to Anna, and after expressing shock and incomprehension to the stone bath that floated on the water, she asked the same problem as the nightingale. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland repeated the answer and saw Anna meditation on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔...Educational education has a long way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On the other hand, Fanna is hesitant to join the artillery team or the firearms team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything must start from the order three days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
