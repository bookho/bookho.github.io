			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Ice Witch described in the report, it looks like a hairless spider and an ant with a big belly; the upper body Slender, can clearly see the subsection, the lower body is high, almost the size of the adult's torso. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, this is not the limit of the expansion of the worm. If you want to wrap the madman all over, its abdomen should at least expand to about two or three times the normal state. According to the "photograph" returned from the scene, when it is in a state of containment, the head will be buried in the ground, leaving only the inflated belly exposed, which looks like a mature egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You killed it?" Felice asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's more convenient. Although it's not aggressive, it's still very fast to escape." Ai Gesha then condenses the ice into a slender Sharp blade, cut into the belly of the insect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a slightly stinky milky white liquid flowed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This mucus has a certain antiseptic effect. Under normal circumstances, it can flow freely. After a long time, it will slowly solidify and become a protein like chicken protein. She explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then...to eat?" Falti couldn't help but frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t eaten it, but the taste is not too delicious," Aegusa shook her head. "The key is another body fluid on it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time she was busy for a quarter of an hour before she opened the skin of the back of the bug and pulled out a slimy green organ. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks a bit like a gallbladder," Felice said with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it’s not bile," Aegusa carefully cut it into a small hole and smashed into a pool of mucus to squeeze two drops. The dark green juice, then summoned two ice cones again, and quickly stirred up the mucus. "The next step is the focus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland holds his breath and carefully stares The change of "preservative solution". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before the liquid begins to become sticky, and the ice witch is slower and slower. After about two or three minutes, it’s not in it. The ice cones have been unable to separate, as if they were tightly consolidated together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out his finger and pressed the surface of the mucus and found that it had been transformed into a gel with a soft surface, but after pressing a few millimeters It is difficult to take another step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Felice was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bio-rubber," Roland’s tone brought a hint of excitement. "It’s this thing that makes Fran’s move impossible."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the first report sent by Ai Gesha, he noticed the strange character of the relic reptile, initially thought it was a spider-like ability, but with the follow-up The report was delivered. He found that the mucus after solidification has excellent elasticity and toughness. It is not much more than rubber. It can not only be cemented on the surface of the object, but also can be shaped arbitrarily before solidification. It has made it practical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Roland has been sending people to find colloidal plants, he believes that once a sample is found, the leaves can be transformed into high-yield crops that can be grown on a large scale. However, neither the rubber tree nor the rubber grass can get the exact news. Even the species-rich morning kingdom has never heard of such plants. Therefore, wherever elastic materials are needed, they can only be handed over to Soroya. solve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly equivalent to limiting the capacity of no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case that a new batch of machine tools has been put into use, and the production efficiency and processing level of the factory have been significantly improved, the rubber has become the most obvious short board. Although he knows well, rubber is just a general term for elastic materials. Besides natural production, it can be artificially synthesized. However, he does not know how to operate it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Roland suspected that there was no colloidal plant in this corner, the exploration of the snowy mountain ruins gave him unexpected surprises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
