			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pushed the door of the office and Barov had been waiting in the room for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He threw the instrument to the assistant of the minister, lying straight down on the chair, with a tripod on the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no outsider present, he really wants to take a little song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Highness, please mourn," Barov quickly read the papers and frowned. "The king died unfortunately, and the murderer was the great prince. It’s a tragedy. I don’t know what you want to do next.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”Gron’s death is too much, I want to see the three sisters and the five sisters. Decided to make another plan," Roland said. "But in any case, we should take precautions in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balov looks to the prince, waiting for the other's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wang all may become turbulent because of this change of power. The first thing to do is to pick up your loved ones and family members." Of course More importantly, in order to prevent the two princes from taking these people to threaten their own ministers, for the time being, to maintain the administrative and financial operations of Bianbu Town, the assistant to the minister is indispensable. Roland took a sip of tea and continued, "You and Carter, as well as your men, have written a book, and I will carry the guards to the kings and arrange them to other towns."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not used in the town?" Barov is not a fool. Twenty years of political experience has made him immediately understand the prince's deep meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." Roland did not want the other party to threaten his family with his family, nor did he want to think that he was threatening them with his family, so he chose to compromise. The method was first resettled to other safer towns. After waiting for the town to stand firm, he moved to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, thank you for your concern," the assistant minister nodded and agreed, which made Roland relieved. In the final analysis, there are too few talents available to you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the ore trade, the recent iron ore mine was suspended and only sold gemstones to Liuye Town," he ordered. "These iron mines." Stone I need to stay from use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This will reduce fiscal revenue, Your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "But it won't drop too much, and miners have discovered a new gem deposit that can make up for some of the gaps," Roland said. And there was no business in winter. Everyone was reluctant to go out to do business in the days when the evil beasts could be haunted at any time. It is very likely that there will be only two or three rounds of trading in the long four months. For lightweight dhows, it is clear that transporting gemstones is a more cost-effective option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand," Barov recorded these. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the assistant of the minister left, Roland called Carter Lannis again. "I need to expand the size of the militia. After the recruitment, you will arrange it. Several quick-responding and capable players are placed in the new team as captains. The training is based on the method of the last implementation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, if still pressed The last training method, the new team may have to take a long time to come in handy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is also stronger than a group of people," Roland waved his photo I said what I said. Although the team trained in this way is far from being an army, I am afraid that it is the level of military training for college students, but sometimes it is worth comparing with the opponents. In addition to the evil beasts that don't have long brains, the opponents he is most likely to encounter are a group of "mixed army" that are temporarily patched together by private soldiers, mercenaries, and serfs. As long as they are equipped with weapons of the era, the level of college students can almost cope. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Carter left, Roland couldn’t help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t expect that such a coincidence would happen! It is simply a charcoal in the snow and a pillow when you sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bad news for yourself? Is it a dilemma? Big mistake! He doesn't know much about Garcia Wimbledon, but she is by no means the kind of person who is being slaughtered. The big prince was sentenced to death in such a short period of time. Even if there is no insider, she probably won't return to the kingdom easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
