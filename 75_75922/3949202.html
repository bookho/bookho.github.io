			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the moon began to sink, Gordon Wimbledon saw the looming outline of the wall of the kingdom in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few months, now it is finally back, he thought. The exhaustion of the long journey disappeared a lot, but he remained vigilant, grabbed his mount and signaled his deputy to inquire about the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plan has not changed, the Angkor should have replaced the guards of the defending city with their own cronies, and put down the side door suspension bridge after the deputy signaled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the front with wide eyes, for fear that he would miss the faint fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This waiting time is not long, Gordon feels that time is solidified. When the eyelids are sour and can’t hold on, he finally sees the distant The flashing - two below the wall, three above, as agreed in the plan. He took a sigh of relief and waved his people to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, you are only one step away from the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gronon rode through the side wall of the city wall, and the deputy walked side by side with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed more than 20 cavalry behind him, all without a word, pulling the reins and controlling the mount to move slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall material of the Grey Fortress is taken from the Dragon Ridge. This taupe stone gives off a dark red glow under the torch, just like being soaked in blood. general. The entire city wall was 20 feet wide. At that time, in order to build this wall, more than a thousand laborers, slaves, and stonemasons died on the construction site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall of the copper wall that the tens of thousands of people could not overcome, but now it is easy to pass by themselves, Goron thinks that any loopholes start from the inside. Somehow, he remembered the new holy city, the seemingly more magnificent and indestructible walls, will it be broken from the inside? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I am waiting for you for a long time." Passing through the city gate, Angkor and the team are waiting at the door. When I saw Goron appear, the bachelor quickly turned over and squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon put aside the distracting thoughts, probably because he was too excited, and he couldn’t help thinking about it. "You did a good job, did the guards of the palace change?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Back to the Highness, there was a surprise in the plan. The silver hand knight who had already said that he was willing to work for you was transferred to the Southland three days ago, and now only has time to replace it. The guard of the palace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gron frowned, which meant that it was impossible for him to bring these twenty people into the palace. The guards will not block themselves, but will not let so many fully armed people enter the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, as long as the team members of the palace divide two to follow me, the rest keep the door, don't let outsiders come in and bother me," he hesitated for a moment. With determination, although the plan has changed, the situation is still in control. Father's guards usually stay in the outer room for the night, as long as someone can hold them for a moment, they have the confidence to slap them under the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the inner city, as if everything was back to the way he left. Although at night, he still recognizes every street. Here is his place, no doubt. Everyone jumped off the horse and walked quickly to the palace. When they arrived at the door, more than 20 people dispersed according to the new plan and lurked outside the palace. As the Aung-School said, the guards were surprised that the prince was the king of the night, but when Goron swindled and said that there was something behind him, he opened the door and let him enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he is the eldest son of the king of the Grey Fort, the first heir to the jurisprudence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince and the aunts pass through the garden and the main hall, and the former castle is the place where Wimbledon III lived. The bachelor raised the torch in his hand and swayed from side to side. Immediately, the guards walked out from the dark and kneel down on both knees. "His Royal Highness, please follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Goron sucked his nose and he smelled a bloody smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not that the guards of the palace have all been replaced? He looked at the guard by the fire, and he was indeed a familiar person - a knight who supported his own count on the throne. This gave him a little peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
