			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the witch finished, she left the hall and did not even leave the opportunity to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is a little sideways. "What's the matter, can you see what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two sides are telling the truth." The nightingale whispered in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out that he thought for a moment and quickly guessed the general reason for the matter. The truth does not represent truth, but the "truth" that I believe is true. It seems that the problem lies in the book that records the history of the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you have made a special trip from the Long Song Fortress, don't rush back, stay in the film family for a few days, and you can also visit the town. Scenery.” Roland looked at the stunned jazz. “I will ask her about the situation. Maybe it will let you talk again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes... is that true?" The jazz groaned and then bowed his head. "There is a place to work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right, you bring Where are the magic stones and ancient books now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the cabin, there are ten boxes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, all shipped to the castle," Roland nodded. "I saw that I could survive for more than four hundred years, and I think her mood will ease."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, the prince will call Gesha to the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should probably listen to Sir Sirte’s statement," he repeated the story told by the other party, "regardless of how your steward did it." But he is at least looking for you with the idea of ​​returning things to the original owner. Maybe he still wants to make up for the responsibilities owed by his ancestors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He Deceived his own descendants, these people do not owe me anything," Ai Gesha grinned. "And now the witch family is meaningless. They are also one of the Western aristocrats? I accepted them, but instead let It's not convenient for you to do the next thing - you want to put the entire jurisdiction of the West into your own hands, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is a little glimpse, he doesn't I thought that the other person would think of this, then smiled and shook his head. "Well, you can make sense. But you seem... don't blame them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I don't have to accumulate an anger for mortals four hundred years ago on his descendants, let alone they Without knowing it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the enlightened person of the witch kingdom, and Roland feels in his heart, whether it’s treating the attitude of a mortal or accepting new things, Holding a positive attitude. In my opinion, this is undoubtedly a very good attitude, but for the four hundred years of Takira, I am afraid it is a strange performance, it is no wonder that at the Quest, she will be excluded by other witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that case, I will explain to them," he laughed. "Next, don't you know if you are interested in counting your estate?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha turned a blind eye, no good air, "not my, but the legacy of the secret society."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boxes were all carried to the basement of the castle. In addition to Aegusa, Roland also called Tilly, Sylvie and Anna. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Sylvie's review, the boxes were opened one by one - in the fifteen wooden boxes, ten boxes were stored in the magic stone. Roland took out a piece of palm-sized spar and snarled. "You said that they were all transformed from the stone of God's punishment. Such a large piece of stone may be worth two or three hundred gold dragons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two or three hundred gold dragons?" Ai Gesha disdain, "The magic stone can only be made by the Chaos Beast, and each piece can be regarded as an invaluable treasure."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are these magic stones?" Tilly asked. "They don't seem to be taken with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
