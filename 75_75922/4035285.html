			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jie Luo adults, Maggie can't support for how long."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanilla turned his head and said with a worried look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo noodles look at the top of the head - although At the bottom of the earth, the dome is bright. I saw that the gods were moving forward along a strip of tunnels, eroding the enemy's position a little bit, but obviously their progress was getting slower and slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of soldiers are guarding at each gate, and the straight passage is almost inevitable. When the spear is thrown, it is bound to be knocked down by the snow powder weapon. The distance between the ditches can only be filled by the number of people. Many of the bottoms of the pits have been filled with blue blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the ground, it is even harder to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Warrior can jump over the enemy’s firepower, especially in the line of defense, even though they can leap over the barbed wire that stretches and slams. In the rear of the four towers, the death of the fire almost never stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the third ditch is the limit of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, I didn’t expect things to fall into such a deadlock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is well prepared for this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, find the location of Roland Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peace talks of the messenger group are just a scorpion. It is better to see each other and not to see much. In the letter written in the name of the Pope, it reveals some secrets about the church and the battle of God. This sounds like a fairy-tale news. Others may laugh, but the name of the pope is guaranteed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the content she wrote is true, even if Roland has a witch who can tell the truth according to the handwriting, I can't see any Ni Duan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the letterhead is smeared with a special kind of powder - it is an alchemical product developed by the sect of the sect, which can be emitted by ordinary people. taste. Every time you touch the paper, the taste is added up and immersed in the skin, even if it is washed, it is difficult to remove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo believes that they will be sent to Roland in succession - no ruler will not be interested in this secret, and it is impossible to give the stationery to other See people. As a result, the smell on his body must be the strongest of all, although it looks no different from ordinary people, but under the nose of vanilla, this taste is the most eye-catching beacon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the vanilla exerts its ability, it can smell a lot of incredible taste. According to her, the blood of a month is still emitting a slight stench, when the animal is in estrus They can also detect the strange smells that flow on their epidermis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Roland is only a thousand steps away from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, considering that there may be witches in the camp that can observe the magic, Jielu does not hesitate to use the gods and the trial army to attract the attention of the gray castle defense. Force, and even some less important pures are also used as victims. The true decisive people are buried deep underground, relying on Maggie's magical ark to walk between the rock formations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final break is the black yarn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the three purest esteemed by Oberlin’s Majesty and the highest in the Holy City, her ability is like an unprotected mortal Death is coming. Before the age of juveniles, anyone who looks at her will feel the fear from the bottom of her heart. In adulthood, this ability is further enhanced. As long as she sees her eyes, she will be deprived of her mind by fear, killing herself or hurting people around her madness and horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the branching ability of the black yarn awakening is also extremely powerful. The individual vision is not limited to the creation of fear, but the fantasy that is difficult to distinguish, although only at the same time Can affect a person, but can play a miraculous effect at a critical time - Archbishop Tefron has no doubt about the Pope's order, that is, the ability of the black yarn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything seemed to be very smooth. Until the beginning of the war, Jieluo discovered that she was still miscalculated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not expect herself to underestimate the power of snow powder weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s weapon actually launched an attack ten miles away. The mountain road was covered with smoke and flames, and the defense army was not touched. hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After turning to the offensive position, she found that the situation of God's penalty army is not much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These seemingly shallow ditches are even more difficult than the towering walls, and the warriors took a slanting projectile to capture a horizontal groove, but did not expect The enemy did not care about the gains and losses of the front line. They retired in an orderly manner, and gave the channel to the gods who had paid a heavy price to approach, and then continued to rely on the follow-up channels to stop the actions of the warriors. In the meantime, Jie Luo even saw an extraordinary person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie’s magical ark can’t be maintained all the time, and the momentum of the gods’ penalty is getting weaker, but the current situation is still far from her original expectations. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Isabella’s perception, the enemy’s stone wear rate is less than half, and if you want to let more people see her as much as possible, you must They are gathered together. Now the Prisoners are still only advancing to the third trench, and the gathering of personnel in the remaining trenches is still too sparse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the black gauze is exposed to the crowd, the time for exerting the ability must be extremely limited, and only one or two interest can be focused on her. How many people are there? I am afraid that many people have not recovered, she has been knocked down by snow weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, the Ark... is about to collapse..." Maggie's face blew a large sweat on her face, and her voice trembled slightly. Obviously, overloading with magic power is extremely burdensome for her. At the same time, cracks appeared on the walls of the space, and the dome began to become dull. Jielu knew that he had to make a choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, she has no other choice at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Upward, act according to the scheduled plan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maki long exports gas and begins to control the ark Quickly close to the ground, just at the moment of rushing out of the ground, the magic instantly dissipated, the pungent smell of smoke, the dull continuous roar and bloody breath suddenly filled the surrounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black yarn turned back and looked at Jielu, and then jumped out of the square pit formed by the ark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is foreseeable that this is her last time working for the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield suddenly quieted down, as if an invisible giant hand pinched the throat of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isabella!" Jieluo said, "Enable Unlimited!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sound of the sound is crisp, and a few blood flowers bloom behind the black yarn, and then fall back to the bottom of the pit like a leaf without roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella bites his teeth and holds the seal in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black translucent magic stone suddenly gives off a dull glow, as if inhaling the surrounding sunlight, an invisible ripple spreads from here, in "unlimited" Under the influence, it quickly spread throughout the battlefield - its fluctuation is exactly the same as the stone that Roland wears, but in the opposite direction. Under the influence of this ripple, the black holes formed by the high-quality stone disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, the cleansing turned into a glimpse of light, rushing to the king of the gray fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of flying out of the pit, she overlooked the entire battlefield from a height -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hundreds of mortal warriors who stumbled into the tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock and fear on the enemy's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary person who is approaching quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity to charge the trial army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
