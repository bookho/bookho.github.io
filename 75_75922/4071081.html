			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance to the cave is located in the north of the city without the winter city, the junction of the city and the mountain, and the half-mountain of the top of the head is the endless group of mines and furnaces. Area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the foot of the mountain, a solid concrete wall appeared in front of everyone, with a sentry tower at the four corners, a wire mesh at the top, and a large doorway Two machine guns for bunkers. Although some facilities are still under construction, this place has become the most rigorous area for no winter city guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the courtesy of the defending soldiers, Roland walked into the yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a wall apart, but he’s born with an illusion that spans more than a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene inside should never appear in this era - it is a huge hole wrapped in concrete, the width is more than ten meters, and the height is five Mita. It is flanked by two magnificent iron gates, not only the size of the hole, but also the thickness of the door is astonishing one meter. Although it is not solid casting, but is made up of several layers of steel plates, but the added armor thickness is more than half a meter, it is completely a heavy-duty partition door that modern military fortresses will have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the weight of the iron door is too striking, the hole has to be reinforced and the rails are installed on the ground. Even so, manpower alone cannot promote it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there are two steam engines on the side of the courtyard wall, one of which is responsible for powering the switch gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the evil beast breaks through the line of defense established by the Tsinghua witch, this gate will block any trailing evil beasts after withdrawing the relics of the gods. Behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to build it, no winter city consumes almost one-third of the entire winter steel production, and the square shape does not seem to have any technical content. But "giant" in engineering itself means technology. Standing in front of the general partition of the building, Roland can feel the rich power it contains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day the gate was installed, he witnessed the opening and closing of the iron gate. The steam engine makes a dull roar, the harsh friction of the wheel and rail, and the jumbo giant that slowly closes, just like the entrance to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a line of distorted text on each side of the iron gate. If they are together, it means the third side of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrian walked into the hole and the light dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice took the glowing magic stone and walked to the front of the team, leading everyone to the deep hole in the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I have never understood why you should call this the third side of the city," Wendy said. "If the outside border area If you count the first city, then where is the second side of the city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the three are suitable," Roland replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, you don't think the third ordinal is very compatible with the fortress. Anymore, the name is not important, as long as it can be remembered." He is a handkerchief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, if you like." Wendy grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the respite, there are only resounding footsteps and dripping sounds in the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the lack of concrete spraying tools, this channel has only been hardened on the ground, and the left and right sides are drains and mine rails, when you need to transport supplies and food, The steam engine placed in the hole will pull a trailer for transportation. Roland once heard of Felice, and some of the goddess of witches also had an interest in how much strength this machine had. It turned out that even if five people held a twine, they could not stop the steam engine from pulling them to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the walls and the top of the cave cannot be covered with concrete, water seepage is inevitable, so the temperature in the mountain is not too low, the road will not be freeze. The place where the worms swallowed will also leave a mucus. After drying, the soil will be glued together, just like a layer of paste. Don't worry about the risk of the cave collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
