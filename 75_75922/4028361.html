			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo stood on the top floor of the Tongtian Tower and looked at the busy holy city of Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of believers who went to the plateau was twice as many as in previous years, and so was the new Judgment Army - just for the winter, it sent nearly 20,000 to the church. The population, the army lost in the battle with the evil beast and the wolf kingdom, was quickly supplemented, and the scale passed the beginning of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the reunification of the four kingdoms is the only correct decision made by Oberlin, and the church will undoubtedly wait until the gray castle and the morning sun 6 continue to fall into the hands of the holy city. Will usher in a new peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is not enough. She thinks that this peak is more than enough to rule the secular kingdom, but it is still not comparable to the federation with fertile plains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to win in the battle of God, the church must do more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time is not Isabella?" The sound of Teflon suddenly came from behind, and Jerry turned and saw that the three archbishops walked in. In the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She was sent to the morning to perform the supervision task," Jie Luo said slightly, to pay tribute, "I am here to replace her to host this day." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the Pope really so busy?" El shrugged. "Is there no time to see us?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pay attention to your attitude, El," Soli Darr frowned. "There is no intention to ask you to question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just talked about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sitting in that position is really very busy," Teflon laughs. Laugh, "When Oberlin is still there, I often listen to Mayn and Heather complaining."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true," The man made a gesture of asking, then went to the small table by the window. "Let's talk here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not go to the secret room?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church situation today If there is a good one, who will eavesdrop on our conversation and leak it out?” Jie Luo said easily. “Even if you are a stubborn aristocrat, you know which side to choose.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there are always people who like to go against the current," although Tefren did not agree with her, but did not insist on going to the secret room, the other two did not matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you talking about the four Princes of the Grey Fort?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Besides him Who else," the old man took a sip of tea after sitting down and shouted. "The plan we tried to surround the West has failed. It is not only a pure person, but even the main sacrifices are followed back to Hermes, which is simply ridiculous! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was your majesty who agreed to withdraw them," Jie Luo said without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean... Mayn?" Teflon stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One step slow, slow pace," she nodded. "Since the silver whip was killed in the Dragon Ridge, we fell behind Roland Wimbledon. By the time I know this news, it’s already three months, and it’s too late to send new people. So you don’t have to blame the pure people, they will only become the target of Roland.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need to punish? I want to take this opportunity to temper the temper of Emma," Soly raised an eyebrow. "She always questioned my order." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That must be a loophole in your command," El said sarcastically. "After all, for the trial warrior, it is difficult to brainstorm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t wait for Soli’s remarks, Jielu has taken the lead. “Listening to her doubts may help you a lot. But you have to discipline your purity.” I will not say anything more, just don't be too embarrassed. Every pure person is a hard-won wealth of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Jieluo adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe I have known it for a long time," Jielu said. "We all know that he started to recruit witches long ago, and he is still mixing with the people who sleep on the island. - The witch's ability is very strange, can know the news of the church. It’s not surprising at all.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s not a good sign that I’ve snatched so many stones and I’ve seen a lot of sales there. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily," she knocked on the table and focused everyone’s attention. "This is why you are called today." The intelligence agencies in the secluded area have recently experienced abnormal grain purchases in the Windwind Ridge. In addition, the number of vessels passing through the north of Chishui City is incredible. One or two ships can be seen almost every day, but Silver City has not seen these ships. Driving to the kingdom, the same is true of the Sanwan River."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The three looked at each other. "Where did the boat go?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been busy with the recycling department recently." In the morning battles, the situation is not normal, so Jieluo bluntly said, "After excluding the two sides of the thing, there is only one place where they can go - the valley town of the North. It has the only tributary connected to the Chishui River and is the nearest town to the north of the Grey Fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the memory of the Queen of the Water, she is against the Grey Fortress The towns are well-known, "In other words, Roland Wimbledon is mobilizing the resources of his territory and focusing them on the North. What he wants to do, the answer is self-evident."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one of the three bishops is a stupid person. They quickly understand the meaning of Jieluo, but understand that it is one thing, and believe that it is another matter, "Wait, Do you think Roland intends to attack the holy city of Hermes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not what I think, but the conclusions analyzed by the intelligence agencies, and the Pope also agrees This speculation - the victory of Wang Du makes his confidence so high, that the holy city of Hermes is also It’s not hard to understand that this decision will be made. It is true that his snow powder weapon is far stronger than that of Feike, but we are not unprepared. Therefore, the Malay will allow the church members of the Grey Fort to temporarily evacuate. "Jielu is a handkerchief. "The aristocrats are ready to openly smash the churches around us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He...insane! Soly whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Wimbledons are mad," El swallowed. "Jiacia is like this, and Roland is the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This news is of great importance, we should make further confirmation," Tefron indulged for a moment, "Would you like me to let the pure man of his hand go to the cold wind to inquire?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no need," Jielu vetoed. "We will attack the Grey Fort sooner or later, so he will concentrate the troops and save things, so we don't have to be like a wolf." The heart is like a city, a city to attack - as long as the four princes are defeated, the war is over." She looked at Tefron, "How long will we be able to complete the material preparation?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old bishop said, "Two weeks or so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you send an advance army of about a thousand people? Three hundred gods punished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The team of this size will be able to come out tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "Very good," Jielu got up. "Rather than waiting for Roland to come to us for trouble, it is better for us to take the cold wind ridge. He is not collecting food there? Maybe it can compensate us a little stone." Loss. Soli Dar, this advance is your responsibility, and won the Windy Ridge within three days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she did not receive an immediate response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three hesitated for a moment, in which Tefron asked, "Is this what you mean, or what does Mein mean?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Jielu suddenly felt an anger in his heart, this group of idiots, she is the successor recognized by Oberlin, and is the continuator of the Union orthodoxy. Can mortals dare to question themselves? She suppressed her heart and pretended to be like nothing to say. "Of course it is the decision of His Majesty the Pope. If you have any doubts, you can ask him personally, but the affairs in the secret area are very heavy, so there is no special matter. It is best not to interfere with your work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
