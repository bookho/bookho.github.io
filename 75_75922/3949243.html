			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishop Mein stepped through the circular staircase of the first and second order and walked deep into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a naturally formed tiankeng, the depth of which can be at least four towers of the sky, about 20 feet in diameter, and it is more than enough to fit into a lord’s castle. . The cave was not dim at first, and there was a skylight on the high dome. Light passed through a window and fell into the ground, leaving a winding spot on the stone wall cast by the ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the height continues to drop, the spot gradually darkens and quickly merges with the stone wall. However, the center of the pothole reflects a faint blue light. The more you go down, the more obvious it is. Even if you don't hold the torch, you won't fall into the dilemma of reaching out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stairs at the foot are like a small snake that surrounds a pothole and clings to the rock wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stairs are cut from granite, rectangular, thick three fingers, enough for two people to walk side by side. One end is embedded in the rock wall and the other end is suspended. In order to prevent accidental fall, the suspended ends are provided with wooden railings, and the railings are connected by ropes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn’t counted how many stairs there are, but he knows that every slate is arduously laid. The stonemasons of the church hang down on the ropes, tapping deep enough grooves on the hard rock, and then stuffing a piece of stone into it. Every movement must be careful, because the rope slips or breaks into the bottom of the pit, and there are as many as 300 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Hermes Cathedral built on top of the head is a symbol of the unyielding spirit of the church, then the Hermes institution hidden in the bottom of the cave is the true church. Core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone wall of the ladder is inlaid with a stone of punishment. Every 100 steps, there will be a trial army standing guard, and there is also a team of gods in the army. Stand by to meet the invaders. There are many sandbags and gravel buried between the dome and the mezzanine of the cathedral floor. If the holy city defense fails, and the people have to evacuate, the pope will start a trap and let the gravel and gravel completely bury it here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mayn was not the first to go to Hermes, the feeling of walking in midair still made him feel dizzy. Especially when looking to Zhang, there is always the illusion that you are falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was relieved when his feet were on a solid ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the tiankeng is a huge disc-shaped white grindstone with a smooth surface like a mirror, and even standing on it can clearly see its reflection. After the craftsman's ingenious design, the light from the skylight of the dome is condensed several times in the wall of the pit, and it will just gather on the grindstone at the bottom of the hole. Even if the torch is not lit, the bottom of the tiankeng is not dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only found at the bottom of the pit that the sun is not colorless. After the grindstone was illuminated, it reflected a faint blue light, and looked up. The whole tiankeng was lit by this blue light, showing a cold color. If you look closely, you can also notice that there are countless dusts flying in the light, like the tiny creatures recorded in the ancient books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the naturally formed holes in the wall of the cave, the church opened the connection and further expanded and built the Hermes institution. Thanks to these well-connected holes, the air flow is smooth and there is no such feeling of decay and dullness in the depths of the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean stepped into the door of the institution, and the defense force was suddenly stricter. Here the judges are a group of five, guarding each level - they are the most loyal warriors of the church. Once they accept this duty, everyone will spend the rest of their lives in the institution and never return to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, only he and the pope can enter and leave the organization, even the two archbishops Heather and Teflon can not get involved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mayn is not sure how many roads there are in the agency. In addition to this main road in the south, there are many branch passages on both sides. Walking along them all the way, more branches are often found. Some were used by the church, while others were simply sealed. He had heard that when the organ was built, several craftsmen mistakenly entered the unmarked martyrdom, and as a result, they lost their way and never found the way back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The straight main road leads to the depths of the mountain. Every 30 feet (about 100 meters), there is a level. Mayn knows that the tasks between the agencies in each level are different. The outermost section is the living area, where the warriors who live at the bottom of the cave live. The second paragraph is the archives, which are used to store paperwork, scraps and ancient books. The third paragraph is the prison area, where some prisoners who cannot see the light... and innocent people are held. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
