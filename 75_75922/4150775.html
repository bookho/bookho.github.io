			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod’s face is closed and the door is twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dull people will no longer have any doubts, they are completely calculated by humans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of bugs!!" Siassis roared angrily, and the whispering shorts on his cheeks revealed its inner killings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up!" However, Heikezod interrupted it. "If they are bugs, what are we being counted by bugs? From today At first, I don't want to hear the name 'bug' anymore!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it stood up and flew towards the other side of Dagong Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black smoke is still tumbling to the heights, forming a very strong column of smoke, with a faint flash of light shining beneath it, like a magma erupting from the ground. And the city is a mess, even if it is not covered by the fireball, you can also see a lot of horizontal bodies, I do not know whether it is dead or alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is not the focus of its attention - the facts have already happened, staying here can not reduce the loss, only increase the anger, have this effort, it is better to let The enemy pays more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the south of the island, the Scorpio Lord saw some ships that had not yet gone far, even though they were full of sails, but in the face of their own abilities It is no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as it was ready to step across this distance, the light shining below it caught its attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw someone flying from the outskirts of Dagong Island and heading south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that it was thought that the person who detonated the flames had been buried in the sea with the striker army. I didn’t expect the human being to fight the whole body and retreat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the witch perform the detonation mission, and then easily evacuate from the battlefield? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is such a simple thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Heaven immediately changed his goal, and opened the door of twisting to the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a female with a short blond hair, and her face was surprised and she didn’t expect it to come suddenly. Hecksod did not want to say anything, and directly reached out to grab her--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but caught nothing but touched anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female in front of her eyes suddenly broke out at an incredible speed, almost stunned in the blink of an eye, and her provoked waves were like a wall.狠 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在 在<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the witch slowed down after flying a distance, as if it cost a lot of physical strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It snorted and chased it again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a step away – this time when it’s just out of the twisted door, the other side has been dragging a series of white fog out of the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod was furious and used his ability for the third time. This time he simply positioned the door in front of the other side and wanted to see her back. Where are you going? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at the moment of crossing the door, it suddenly felt a lot of sight converge on it, as if it had suddenly come from the empty city to the center of the city. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Heaven has turned his head and looked at the source of these sights - only the sea antenna and the land direction have black shadows coming to this position. There are both iron birds and witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...a premeditated ambush? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the guy deliberately stopped and stopped, thinking that she was limited by the magic, can only show this short-time accelerated flight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod smirked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They not only counted its army, but even prepared to calculate it further? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this time retracement, it is just a matter of thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it didn't do that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s not a demon, it’s always a point of care, but that doesn’t mean the male wears the stone of punishment. Can override the top of a maharaja! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wants the other party to know who is the master of the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, eight iron birds have rushed to the front, and a series of fires spewed out of their heads-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; Hecksort waved with one hand, opened the twisted door directly in front of him, swallowed the shovel from the other side, and opened the other side of the door on the side of the iron bird. After the fatal loss passed through the door, they swept straight into the position where they came. In an instant, several iron birds were hit and the formation suddenly became chaotic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s a little surprising that the iron shovel, which had a deadly effect, didn’t let the iron bird fall apart on the spot, leaving only a few on the body. a hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Heaven soon threw this accident behind his head, and it stepped high to the ground, stepping on the entire battlefield, and the iron birds obviously could not Keeping up with it, although he began to climb up, the clumsy gesture was slower than the worm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as it was going to shred it one by one, a passing bird suddenly turned into a beast and opened his mouth and bit it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyebrows did not take the common birds at sea as a threat, and Hecksod’s slamming was able to avoid this sneak attack, and it opened annoyedly. The palm of the hand, a black light suddenly stands between the two - this is also a twisted door, but its width is only one finger, and the part that passes through is obviously not left in the other parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be aware that the disaster is coming, the fearful beast has turned back to the seabird, but it is obviously difficult to achieve the body shape in such a short distance, she The half of the wing is still rubbed against the black line, and the wing tip and feathers that are cut off are like snow flakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before it was added to the final blow, the roar of the rumble sounded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blond witch turned into a dazzling golden light and hit it straight! Heikzod, who has no time to re-apply, can only inspire the magic of the whole body, turning it into a strong shield that wraps the whole body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘭"————!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two banged together, huge The impact of the bombardment of the other side of the golden light into a myriad of fragments, also caused a suffocation in the chest of Hecksod. Only the other side is obviously hurt more seriously, not only the mouth is bleeding, but also an arm is folded into several pieces. However, the witch completely ignored her own injuries, and the other surviving hand had pulled out a short fire branch from the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had no choice but to reopen a twisted door, and if the other party fired, the shovel would only hit her partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Heckzod anxious is that this blow is just a scorpion, the witch did not fire at it, but accelerated to fly down, one Hug the fallen seabird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to crush you all into powder!" The battle has now screamed for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at this moment, the most sharp warning was heard in the minds of Scorpio Lords - it came from a large iron bird that fell from the clouds. In the eyes of the eye, the source is the witch who was highlighted by Erskuk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels locked by something--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecker Zod expands the twisted door to the maximum and covers the opponent's attack range! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
