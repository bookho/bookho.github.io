			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the people who sent it? Is there a classification?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, please see below," the assistant of the minister pointed to the bottom of the film. "The total number of people who have been sent to Bianbu Town is 1,100. Most of them are serfs." It has been placed outside the town according to your requirements. The 35 craftsmen have been assigned to Karl, and their residence is concentrated in the "civilized new district"," Barov said the noun of the mouth, "but his Royal Highness, is this okay? I remember that you were originally prepared for the witch. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guards I sent out to spread the gossip have not returned, the progress is slower than I thought, the house first used for craftsmen and their families." Let's build it later." In Roland's plan, Bianbu Town is going to be completely refurbished. The wooden houses and the mud-built bungalows have to be converted into brick houses, leaving a spacious street instead of the present. Most of the alleys are only enough for two people to walk side by side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Barov nodded. "His Highness, I heard that there will be cattle and sheep? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, but not now, I purposely let them send them in the next few days, along with the herdsmen. To the west of the city wall, there is not a grassland between the desolate forest and the desolate mountains. It should be good to change into a pasture. The city wall first blew two gaps for people to pass. After all, it was only useful when the demon moon. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that people are there, money is available, and the bottleneck that curbs the development of Bianbu Town has temporarily disappeared, and Roland can finally let go of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called the guard outside the door and told him: "Go and find the Carl of the Executive Office. I guess he is not in the mine, he must be in the wooden shed outside the town. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Carl walked into the office and stooped and bowed: "His Royal Highness." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I saw this member of the stonemason club, it has been nearly half a year. After recruiting the town hall of Bianbu Town, he can count as this half year. The busiest official presided over the construction of the city wall, the model house community and the temporary shelter of the wooden shed. At the age of 35, he now has a few silver and white skin, but his skin is darker, but his mental outlook is better than the first time. Seeing that there is a lot of strength, the voice is full of voice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment can quickly change a person really is the truth, half a year ago he was still a careful hiding of himself, making a face-lift The stonemason will escape, and now that he has experienced the project command and personally in charge of the project, there has been some demeanor in the gestures. But what Roland most appreciates is his willingness to pay for others.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smiled and nodded. "Sit at the table. He handed a few sketches he had just drawn to the opposite side. "Look at it." I need you to build something new. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the warehouse, um, the bottom overhead can be effective against moisture," Carl quickly swept the first sketch and turned to the second one. For a while, "This... is the stove? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, you need to build more than five kilns on the north slope side to calcine cement and fire clay bricks. Where the point is, considering the location of the transport channel and the yard, it will be necessary to expand more furnaces in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. He turned to the last sketch and frowned. "This... seems to be a ditch?" No, there are top and retaining walls on top... The back is like a pool. My Highness, I don't quite understand. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland laughed. "This is a toilet and it is also your top priority construction project." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The toilet? Carl thought about it. "His Highness, where are you going to build it?" There are commodes in your castle, and the attendants are responsible for handling these buckets on a regular basis. Most of the villagers do not need this kind of thing, they can solve it directly outside the house. The same is true for serfs, which can be discharged into the Chishui River, which will take away these filth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I was on the beach, I smelled a strong smell. Roland shook his head and dispelled the unpleasant memories. "It is so, we are Need to change this bad habit. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...陋习? "Carr doesn't seem to understand much.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the civilians who are accustomed to urinating and urinating, naturally, they will not understand, and they will not step on the mines when they hang around casually. How beautiful the world would be, Roland groaned in his heart. "In short, you can do it according to the sketch, the approximate size I have already marked, using the length determined before. The location is chosen near the wooden shed area, at least four, two two together. In addition to the bricks in the middle of the ditch, the outside sheds, roofs and partitions are all set up with wooden planks, which can save a lot of cement. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
