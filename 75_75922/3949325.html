			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fifth day of the appointment, Roland was finally ready to make all the raw materials for the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of electrolyzed saline, he also had a serious leak, using the copper strip left by Anna to cut the bullet as an electrode, resulting in the electrode being dissolved and wasted. A basin of salt water - in order to avoid chlorine dissolved in water during electrolysis, the electrolyte is generally saturated brine, and salt is not a cabbage price in this era. Therefore, when the waste brine that incorporates the copper ions and precipitates the impurities is poured out, Roland feels that he has thrown away several golden dragons in vain, and finally the electrode is replaced with a carbon rod to solve the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After boiling oil with caustic soda and boiling to obtain absorbent cotton gauze, he took the remaining caustic to the chemical laboratory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The esterification of fire cotton is the most important step in the production process. The principle is not clear. I only know that the gauze should be soaked in the mixed acid solution. Then you can take it out. The solution ratio and reaction time are unknown. Roland let Kemo into several groups to test, using the hourglass control time, the small piece of gauze after soaking is repeatedly washed with water, then soaked in sodium hydroxide solution to react excess acid, and the wet finished product is transported back to the castle and handed over to Wendy is dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the higher concentration of fuming nitric acid in esterification, most of the prototypes can be quickly ignited, one of which is soaked in two parts of nitric acid Fire cotton works best. After getting a rough formula, the lab started mass production – the fired cotton that was soaked and washed was immediately transported away by the soldiers of the First Army, and even the chief alchemist did not know what the things they made were used. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dried gauze was cut into nail-sized squares by the maids, sent to the North Slope Mountain, and finally filled in the backyard of the firing room. In the absence of machine mounting, this process can only be done by manpower. Disperse and sit apart, and glue the glued cotton gauze with a wooden stick to the bottom of the shell, seal the ignition hole, and then pour the granular black fire medicinal funnel into the shell, and compact it. The amount of each load is as consistent as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final step is to press the warhead. The warhead and shell of Anna's processing are extremely high. After pushing it in, it can be tapped with a hammer for a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efficiency is low, and one hundred bullets can be produced in one day. By the sixth day, Carter finally used a new weapon of perfect body. As the chief knight who has excellent physical qualities, his shooting rate has been greatly improved after several days of repeated practice. Compared with the performance of Roland military training, it is completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After changing the bullets, Carter finally has to hold the gun with a strange shooting posture with a sagging wrist, as long as the sealing sponge does not break, the nest is in the nest. It can be kept clean, and its sensitivity to Mars is several times that of black powder, and the firing rate is guaranteed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking on the last day, Roland let Carter Lannis practice a quick shot and a double shot - a 12mm caliber pistol, even with black powder, recoil Very impressive, a single hand gun is difficult to guarantee the second shot hit rate, but in Roland's plan, this is inadvertently countered by the back of the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter will bring a double gun to the stage. If the tug of war is carried out, ten bullets will be enough to win the game. If it is close, it will be pulled out quickly. Another gun counterattacked. Moreover, considering that the other party's weapons have certain defensive capabilities, the ten rounds of bullets Roland specifically chose a steel warhead that is not easily deformed, increasing the penetrating power while reducing the cavities of the cavity. Coupled with the smelting techniques of this era, the slashing swords of the ash are fused with pig irons – the exaggerated shape does not bring about an improvement in quality. On the contrary, the bulky iron weapons are not fully forged. The internal stress distribution is more uneven and cannot be called a good shield. According to Roland's point of view, the big sword top counts more whiteboard weapons. If the luck is not particularly bad, the possibility of jumping is very low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashes want to beat Carter, you must first approach the Cavaliers, this is a natural disadvantage of cold weapons on hot weapons. As long as there is no exaggeration to visualize the ballistic trajectory and to avoid the bullets, this distance is an insurmountable gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Until the sky was getting late, the ashes waited for the wheat to fly back to the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come back in the next few days?" She closed the window and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
