			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Roland saw Barov again, he felt like he saw another person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only does the look look radiant, but the chest is also raised a lot, and there is a voice in the steps, a full confidence comes over, not at all Like a veteran who is nearly fifty years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he has enjoyed himself in these days in Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you know this, you should call you back later." Roland teased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, your Majesty, the city of Shuguang is no longer prosperous, and it is no match for the winter city that you created by yourself." Barov shook his beard, " No matter where I am, my heart is always with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why... Sounds so weird? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coughed twice and switched the subject. "How is the situation there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can rest assured that there are my apprentices and the first army. The newly appointed aristocrats can't move even if they want to make trouble," the general manager said proudly. "I also deliberately relaxed the space for them to fight for power, as long as they do not interfere with the people's livelihood. The matter is working properly. It is estimated that for a long time in the future, they will be intrigued by the power of sesame size - after all, they have not qualified for the city hall before this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a good way." Roland laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Policy checks and balances, he also knows a little about it, but knowing that it’s true, it’s obviously not going to be older than these old foxes Better - even if they are not the most cunning fox, but the victory is thick enough, the means is poisonous. It can be said that until now, Barov has played all his talents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identity of a king of a country, Roland can not be involved in the dirty political tricks, as long as the personnel, the law and the military power in the hands, No one dares to blame his authority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I can ask, where did you send the Finance Minister Lauren Moore?" Barov sighed, "The Royal Palace." The ceremonial officer said that you did not kill him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tax deducted relief rations distributed to the public, colluding with the former prime minister, and forced the refugees to have his One." Roland shrugged. "Sin is not dead. It is not suitable for distribution in a certain age. It is simply expelled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is really... ...pity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, do you want to use him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not, labor Lun is quite influential in Wangdu. I don't know that the little nobles can hold him back.” Barov smiled and shook his head. “Just he was my mentor, pressed me for so long, I couldn't see it. He was amazed at the expression of remorse for mercy, and he was slightly sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but laugh out, "I think he should raise his family to the morning kingdom." ,maybe You will have the opportunity to meet in the future. If you don't say this, I will invite you back to build a few new factories. They are related to the next major series of renovations without Winter City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot of people are needed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, otherwise I will only tell Carl," he nodded. "At least 3,000 people are needed." "About."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baloff said with a wry smile, "Only you will ask for it. It is impossible for other cities to have an industry that invests 3,000 people at a time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The good news is that these three thousand people don't have to be literate, as long as there are more than two hundred people who have completed primary education."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to build?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put the already prepared notebook in front of him, "Coke Plant , steel mills and forging plants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Miss Anne producing enough steel?" Barov asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
