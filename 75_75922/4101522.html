			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end, in the central treasury of the North garrison, everyone is busy for the upcoming sniper war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take the entire front battlefield to the witch?" After listening to the layout of Isis, "Eagle" showed a surprised look, "I don't believe it." Their ability, but there are at least 10,000 people in the morning, and there are not a few people wearing the stone of punishment. The positive enemy is likely to cause the witch to fight hard. Even then, even if we want to save, I am afraid it is difficult. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought so at the beginning," Itis smiled. "In fact, this program is not from the staff, but from The thoughts of His Majesty the King."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a official record?" asked the deputy battalion commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"here," Beidi Pearl handed him a secret letter marked with a red mark. "By the way, the end of the letter was granted to me." The power of the commander."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the rules of the First Army, any military action must have a paper record in front of the battle, and the staff of the corresponding level Review the signature. If the signer is Roland, it means that any army must be unconditionally executed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the acknowledgment was confirmed, the eagle immediately raised his head and performed a military ceremony. "The Northland Garrison is guaranteed to complete the mission!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good," Itis raised his lips. "But remember that your goal is to give the defensive enemy a devastating blow. The point is on the word "flee". If the preconditions do not exist, it is regarded as a failure of the operation. All the ambush personnel return to the cloud ladder according to the original road, and must not greet the enemy without authorization. This order must be clearly explained to everyone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean... retreat? The eagle was surprised. "Don't you know if his method works?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who hasn't tried it, who knows?" "Northland Pearl bluntly said, "If this method does not work, you can only consider other methods... Your Majesty sent me here, just to prevent it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the witch? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if they fail, they will not be in any danger." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood, I am going to prepare, and I can leave every morning tomorrow. "The eagle face again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This combat code is the bomber action, and when you are in place, the battle will officially start." "Itis retaliated with a military ceremony. "Go. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know what the bomber means, the eagle’s heart is inexplicably more confident. The things that can be called “machine” must be different. Where is the steam engine not an excellent example?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning two days later, Lightning finally came to the camp in the middle of the order.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maggie has already All the personnel are in place and you can leave. "The hearing of her hand came to the voice of Sylvie. "The morning army is gathering and gathering, I hope you can catch up." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Rest assured, we will arrive later. After the little girl finished speaking, she waved her hand to the wheat scorpion and the hummingbird. "Come on, we should go!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two days, she not only checked the map of the ladder in the sky, but also looked at the general situation of the surrounding area. The plan is not complicated. The six witches who are the reinforcements are divided into two groups according to the combat plan. One is responsible for ensuring transportation and logistics. The core competence is Maggie's magical ark. In addition, it is equipped with Xavier. With Lily, the former ensures that the enemy first discovers, the first enemy fires, and the latter is for the evil plague created by the church. If the morning army breaks into the old holy city, it is difficult to ensure that the church will not be desperate to release the pathogens in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group is the core of this action.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
