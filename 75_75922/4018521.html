			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boom-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fire was drilled from the 152 gunshots, The iron axe felt the steel battleship under his feet tremble slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the interest rate, a group of smoke broke out on the far wall, and the dull bombardment sounded for a while. When the smoke was exhausted, he lifted the lookout and saw that there was a huge crack on the low stone wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different from attacking the king. The dragon is located in the south-central part of the kingdom. It rarely encounters foreign attacks. The wall is also very low. It is still less than half of the long song fortress. . The wall is only allowed to pass by a single person, and it is impossible to set up a large defensive facility such as a trebuchet. Therefore, the artillery unit has already deployed the field gun on an open space 500 meters away from the city wall. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the efficiency of hundreds of people in the Pioneer Camp, the Iron Axe decided to open three gaps on the wall and then act at the same time, any dare to gather together after the gap Defensive enemies will be ruthlessly hit by a 12-pound gun. Now that the city gate and the northern section of the city wall have been cut through, just wait for the last entrance, he will issue the command of the general attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the witch can act with the army, the iron axe is quite regrettable, and it is still a pity that these precious shells are used against the stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the nightingale is here, just three packs of explosives will send the entire wall to the sky - after all, the enemy’s defensive power is worse than the king. Too far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change of mind even makes him laugh. He knows that six months ago, he insisted that the army should independently complete the task of his Majesty. But since he and the Witch Alliance have teamed up to capture the king, he suddenly feels that it is the perfect state to have a witch in the army as an eye or a raid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult!" the soldier on the lookout yelled, "There is movement in the direction of the gate, they seem to be assembling the horses!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe moves the lookout mirror and looks at the already ruined city gate. Due to the limited view, he can only see some dust behind the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Need to adjust the guns and fire there?" asked Fanna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you want to let the shells fall in that place, at least two or three shots are wasted." He shook his head. "Since it is a horse, I want to They should want to organize the knight to fight, use the charge to open the blockade line of the field guns - what is the worry? It is you..." The iron axe turned to look at the Count of Speer, "after the charge The knights in your territory may not have much left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since I decided to stand on my brother's side, these people are no longer my knights. "She calmly replied, "Let them pay for the betrayal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand," the iron axe paused for a moment, "What do you think?" Did you dispose of Redwin Passy?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just received a secret letter from the City Hall yesterday asking for a loved one besides Speer The rest of the rebellious aristocrats were all escorted to the winter city, and the resisters could be killed on the spot. Their territory was blocked by the First Army, waiting for the statistics officials of the City Hall to arrive and search. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to this posture, the aristocracy’s end is probably all mine service - now several minerals in the fortress area are being mined, no one is mining, family members, cronies If you count with the servants, you have to have hundreds of people. You can harvest a lot of iron ore without the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the chief culprit, Redwin Passy, ​​the letter asks him to hand him over to the count himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sper’s face showed a hint of hesitation, and apparently no decision has yet been made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe sighed in his heart, and if he was, he would not hesitate to cut off the other’s head - nothing is more exciting than betrayal Unable to forgive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are coming!" The watchman suddenly sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He throws these trivialities aside and raises the lookout to keep watching the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously expected, a team of knights rushed out of the gate and headed straight to the outer artillery positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
