			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter, Wang Du. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults... Ma Weien adults..." Someone pushed his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien opened his eyes impatiently, and the blurred vision passed for a while before it overlapped. The familiar face of the old butler also appeared in the pupil. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...what is it for you." He struggled to prop up his body and accidentally knocked down several bottles on the low table, one of them. It fell to the ground and made a "clam" sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound also made him suddenly come back to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a headache after a hangover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, last night, he forced several girls to accompany him to drink, and it was almost four or five in the morning, and finally it was almost on the soft couch. Drowsing past. Ma Weien squinted at the soft couch next to his eyes, which was filled with various drinks and other liquids. After baking for a night, he was giving off an unpleasant sour taste. The girl has long since disappeared. Obviously, on the point of serving the people, their heat is still worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, how did you fall asleep on this stuff yesterday? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Burn it." Ma Weien wiped the saliva from the corner of his mouth and changed his comfortable posture to relieve headaches. "So, my housekeeper, What bad news is there to tell me today? Which knight is running, or is the Grey Fortress already entering Yongdong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't dare "Adult." The butler quickly turned his waist a little lower. The trouble of taking the initiative to find the Grey Fortress squad was exactly the idea he came up with. At this time, he never wanted the master to transfer the spear to himself. People are still fighting the devil in the wolf, and they will not be able to reach the winter in a short time. Please be assured that this is something -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, but that is not sooner or later. "What happened?" Ma Weien interrupted. At this moment, the alcohol in his mouth felt a bit pungent to himself. "The devil's strength has not increased, and even the god of the gods has disappeared. What is the use of comfort in the overall situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, adults —”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Listen to me!” Ma Weien whispered. “I know what you want to say, please cheer up, don’t give up – but you also I saw it, obviously holding the same weapon, but our people are still being beaten by the gray fort. What does this mean? The gap is not in the nobles, but in the bottom of the subordinates and the people! They dare to face the guns, our What about people? You can only hold your head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people are still in the kingdom of Yongdong? Count Visa? No, his current territory The scope is already comparable to the count. The Duke of Remy? Most of his family business is in the winter, and he can't go without it. There is also the family of this family... indeed, the big family is still here, but they don't want to go. "No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, his tone suddenly screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They can't go! It's a car that doesn't want to gather a few generations to gather, starting from nothing! But there are ways, they won't sit still! I invite Those knights will not have such concerns. A land title does not have any binding force at all. This group of people can leave with the title deed and wait until the war has subsided before returning, so I can only close the door and use the banquet. "Retain them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not self-destructive, not to escape, you know?" Ma Weien picked up a bottle of wine and sipped it into his mouth. "Once I fulfilled my promise, they will immediately go to the light! Since the subordinates and the people are better than the gray castle, the only thing that can be relied on is the devil. As long as they can defeat Roland Wimbledon, these people will renew. Settle down, and then reissue the title deeds, these knights can be my greatest help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults...I know, but I must be notified You, day-"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up, you don't know!" Ma Weien's words have been brought with a tremolo. "You feel that I am weak, incompetent, and only drink alcohol all day, but this is not the case, my strategy is not Wrong, the wrong thing is that the devil is defeated! Even they can't win the Grey Fortress. What use is it for me to cheer up? Other people are gone, even my heavy Fleur has left, I Even if it becomes the king of the winter, what is the point? It is better to drink more wine... After all, you can't drink it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, Ma Weien reached for his face and lay down on the soft couch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, I want to say that the Lord of Heavenly Sorrow is waiting in the castle lounge at the moment, it says that there is a new purpose to explain to you." I found the opportunity to speak and quickly said it in one breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You--What do you say?" Ma Weien sat up and sat up. "The Lord of Heaven is coming? Why don't you inform me soon? Get ready for me soon." Hot water, I wash my face and go over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need." Suddenly, a low voice came from the door, and the two couldn’t help but Looking around, I saw a tall blue-skinned figure pushing the door and striding in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is Heikezod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It squinted at the messy furnishings in the house and the empty bottles that were everywhere, and revealed an unobtrusive contempt. "I thought you were What is going to be entangled, it seems that you are wrong. Why, do you think the victory and defeat of this war has been broken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, it listens I got my complaint! Ma Weien quickly fell down on one knee and even wanted to give himself a slap in the face, "No, sir, I am just-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Considering your level of knowledge, I can Forgive you for failing this time, but don't have it next time, otherwise I will unplug your tongue.” Heckzod whispered. “The performance of the previous enemy is indeed beyond our expectations, but it is only the previous period. In fact, their good days have come to the fore, not only the wolf heart, the morning sun and the gray fort will soon be swallowed up by the war, this is the fate of the resisters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello of the Lord of Heaven, may I ask... Is this true?" Ma Weien was half-hearted. He thought that Yongdong was dead, and wanted to ask the devil to seek a place to live, but in the mouth of the other party. The war situation doesn't seem too bad, at least not far enough to save. In view of the fact that they also believed that the gray castle was vulnerable, how much credibility of this remark may have to be a question mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod sneered, "You doubt it is justifiable, but after seeing the "power" of my family, I believe you will understand me. The weight of the words. "When it is finished, raise your hand and open a "door" that emits strange purple light. "Come with me." "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> <br /> On the other side is still a hall, and he was surprised to see many old faces inside, such as Narus and Remy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the Lord of Heaven Most of the nobles of Yongdong have come together.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way for him to ask the situation, the devil is opening a new portal.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of the other party is self-evident.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look at me, I look at you, finally There are long queues to get started.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is almost a day.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien I don’t remember how many portals I walked through. The scenery around me is sometimes a cave. Sometimes it’s a mountain. When I go down, he gets more and more uneasy. Even though he knows that the devil wants to kill him, he doesn’t have to worry so much. Unintentional forced transfer is always heartbreaking Fear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nightfall, the nobles finally arrived at the destination.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last When a door slowly disappeared behind them, Ma Weien Pike slammed his eyes!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is--"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a miracle!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, even if he exhausted all the words, he could not describe himself more accurately. Everything except the miracle, he can't think of anything else!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other nobles are not so good, one by one, always can't say a complete sentence If you come.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
