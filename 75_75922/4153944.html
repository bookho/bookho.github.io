			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Delta and Ipssy failed." Gamma looked up The wall clock on the basement wall, the hour hand above has been a full twelve hours from the planned time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annihilation of God is not an accident, and being an enemy of the world’s founders is inherently unpredictable. As long as they can complete the task, it is not a big problem to die. As long as the time is long enough, they will be born again in the field of the gods sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In twelve hours, nothing has changed in this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fictional space full of magic, it doesn't even feel a glimpse of the cockroaches, let alone the signs of collapse in the entire field. This can only explain that the two failed to complete the scheduled plan and killed the logical consciousness called "Jie Luo". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although unfortunately, we still have our own tasks to complete." Beta put the last five cores into the body and opened his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a red flash, and then a bright red erosive crack appeared in the middle of the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The situation is still not recoverable. As long as we can achieve the goal, there will be a turn for the better. Let's go, the magic here will soon be consumed. As soon as possible, the overlapping state of the two worlds will be restored. Even if it is a martial artist, it is possible to detect our traces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not even have To guess the process of the battle and the cause of the failure, as the messenger of the gods, will not be frustrated by the temporary failure, and will not worry about the consequences of failure, the only thing in the heart, only to do their best to complete the will of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gama nodded silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beta turned and took the lead in the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not an ordinary erosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a "channel" that is built up after consuming a lot of energy and the core of the demon. The other erosive gap connected to it leads to the final battlefield set for the main creators. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gama followed closely, and when he was about to enter the passage, the footsteps suddenly sounded footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a slight glimpse, looking at the source of the sound – it’s shielded by magic, no means of detection, no big amount of outside The demon is defensive, and no one can come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the figure of the coming is revealed in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could it be you?" Gama is incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is a fake Iseti. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan, it should be responsible for dragging the pace of the rescuers and getting enough time for Delta. If the latter did not succeed, Ipsos could not survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it does not get an answer, but an arm that is close to the five fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arm has penetrated its chest with lightning speed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask "jingle" fell to the ground, revealing the rotating disk below the hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gama is looking at the other person incredulously, and consciousness quickly becomes sluggish. "You are... why..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a difference." Ipsy rushed back and let Gamma fall on himself, "...you and you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... want to betray the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment of silence, Ipsy whispered, "Who is the god?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
