			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later, Tilly sent a roster to Roland’s office desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, recruitment is going well?" Roland poured a cup of tea on the other side, asking for help. In the face of this nominal "sister", he has always had a lingering guilty feeling - unlike Anna who volunteered to tell, she is the first person to see through herself as not a four prince. Although the flying action of the five kings under the flying devil attacked the winter city, he understood that she had completely accepted the allies, but the guilty conscience of the heart was not alleviated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he occupied the body of the Four Princes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, I also planned to put my brother’s identity seriously and unreasonably. As a result, the other party did not pursue it, but he was somewhat uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, I want to think about it, he will not take this out and repeat it again - those who want to get an answer in the final analysis will mostly die. Halfway, he knew this very well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the number of people is not ideal, the other is better." Tilly took the cup and sighed her lips, "migrating the people." A total of 124 people were screened out, and 73 people were in the formal residents, adding up to less than two hundred... When confronting the devil, such a person is afraid of not playing any role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s always difficult at first," Roland opened the roster. "When you have an example, you will be able to attract more people in the second round of recruitment." It’s not just a winter without a place.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the horizons are different, humanity’s longing for the vast space is engraved in the bones – from At the moment when the civilization sprouted, people began to look up at the stars. Whether it is mimicking a bird or a balloon, the exploration of the blue sky is not a patent that was only available in the aircraft era. The explorers of the Wonder Club are the best examples, so he is not worried about the Air Force's attraction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to do is to prepare a team that can fly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows that training a pilot is by no means an easy task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the era when the flight control system is still immature, the most important thing for pilots is... talent. Tests such as fear height, anti-stun, and body synergy are just the most basic requirements. The sense of space orientation, understanding of the aircraft, and even the speed of nerve reaction determine whether a person is suitable for a pilot. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veterans of the First Army have very high compliance and reliability. It is okay to select a small number of outstanding officers as core officers. It is difficult for a strong person to form an air force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why he has broadened the screening population to new migrants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of cultural theory can be cultivated by the day after tomorrow. There is no such thing as a gift. It is better to find more qualified people than to make people daring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the statistics, almost 3,000 people signed up in the week, and nearly 200 qualified people were selected. So it seems that the temporary residents were included at the beginning. It is a wise move to consider the scope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last page of the roster, Roland couldn’t help but scream, “Is there still six people who have not passed the oath?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a difference in heart, and was taken up by Vader for interrogation," answered him with a nightingale. "Two of them are official residents of the Winter City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Roland frowned. In theory, this is not something that is worth making a fuss. It is commonplace for people to be fickle. From the time of the sin to the wickedness, he has not expected these people to be forever. But when he really encountered this situation, he still felt a disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could have followed him into a better new era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have even seen the threshold of a new era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last was to abandon it before the threshold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the cause?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
