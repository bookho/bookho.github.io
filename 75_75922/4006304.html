			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the deep hole, everyone bowed down to a woman in gorgeous costumes, and countless candles burned quietly, like stars on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the new child? Look up and let me see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ifei When she raised her head, she could only see a mask that reflected cold light. At that moment, she really wanted to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Herti Morgan, don't be afraid, this mask is just for the convenience of my freedom," the voice of the other party is softer than she thought. Starting today, you are a member of the bloody meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why... you can't accept Anne?" Ifi asked with courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abandon!" The red-haired woman shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other witches also sneered a bit of laughter, as if ridiculing her stupidity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing," Herty waved her hand and walked down the high platform to her, "because I have no way to feed so many witches." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She...she can find her own food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like a mouse, all day long In the gutter, I want to leave the leftovers left by others. Every day, this life will grind all your wildness," Herti shook her head. "The bloody teeth will need beasts, not the mice that are being slaughtered." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wild...beast?" Iphi couldn't help repeating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, have you seen the Rock Wolf?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are the symbol of the wolf kingdom and the master of the mountains and cliffs. They can give birth to three to four cubs, but not every one. Can live, do you know why?" Hetty said slowly, "because the wolf will kill the unfed baby according to the predation, in this way to ensure that the remaining wolves can With sufficient support, the descendants who grow up can continue in the difficult environment of the cliff."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ifei opened her mouth but didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you reduce the feeding of each cub, they can all survive, but they are only alive - young wolves lacking enough nutrients grow up It is also impossible to hunt independently, and it is no different from waste. They can't walk out of the nest, and there is no chance to reproduce. In the long run, the rock wolf will disappear completely. What do you think of?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty evokes her chin, "Child, this is what the gods give us." Revelation, the witch must be like a beast to be able to end in cruel oppression. A powerful fighting witch is naturally a representative of the entire ethnic group, for example...you now!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candlelight swayed, and Effie didn’t hear the cheers, but felt the invisible power behind the tide—it mixed with the emotions of the witches who were excited, excited, and excited. It is like a silent volcano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, she hesitated to ask, "Where... If there is enough food for each wolf?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then they are not wolves," Herti smiled. "It’s a dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whip whipped on her back and made a crisp sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Idiot, this training can't be completed, it's really so much food! Say, is this the first whip?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty-four," Effie bites his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to her is the next whip, blood and sweat running down the back, wet the pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steaks are full of ingredients, enough for them to fill their stomachs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the killing training is very expensive for physical exertion. If you can get more food, as a replenishment between meals, the possibility of completion will be a few more. Minute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the beast...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only powerful witches can survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yi Fei looked at the eye platoon and rushed toward the witch who was closest to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The secret will be annihilated by the church, I heard that no one can escape. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hand of the witch is also."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church has set up a camp on the east coast!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The group of damn aristocrats," Herty's face was very ugly. "I will smash them all together sooner or later!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf's witch forces are destroyed one by one, only the bloody teeth will still be barely supported, although Iphie does not understand how this has anything to do with the island's nobility, but also aware that the situation has Very dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If that's the case, let me and Shaki remove them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's late The church has noticed Dagong Island, and can't stay here anymore," Herty gritted. "We went to sleep on the island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean... The last witch organization that sent pigeons to send letters?" Iphi asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we can draw people from there and strengthen the strength of the bloody meeting. And all this is only temporary, I will come back sooner or later!" The Kingdom of the Wolf Heart is mine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, why are these people willing?" Listening to the command of a little girl?" Herti slammed the cup on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ifei Muror. In her eyes, most of the witches on the island are lambs, and there is not much resistance in the face of strong enemies. The so-called leader Tilly Wimbledon is also the case, if there is not an extraordinary witch around, she is not sitting on the seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably because she is very important to promote non-combat witches?" Sha Ji inserted, "Everyone does not want to be excluded."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s ridiculous! She doesn’t want to want to lay down the fjord church! Is this stupid person believed?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Tilly's brother - the Western lord seems to think so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was all made up by them! No one knows better than me." What the lord likes!" Herti screamed. "You thought that I would build a bloody tooth for it--" She suddenly stopped. "No, I can't let her stop talking like this anymore. You have to go to the West." To reveal the lie of Tilly! Bring my words to him, Tilly Wimbledon can give, I can give more!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know Why, Ifee felt that the old Herti at this time had no appearance of a beast, but it was like an angry and ruined lamb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is why you abandoned me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie’s figure suddenly appeared in front of her "For such a master, for this ridiculous life, you leave me and betray my trust in you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Anne ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iphie was horrified to notice that the other person’s face was blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...had you forgotten me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slammed her eyes open Everything disappeared, leaving only the gray-white room ceiling and the hanging chandelier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
