			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland picks up a lead box, opens the lid, and holds the silver-white metal block inside, feeling the heavy weight of it - not excited Before, it is not much different from a piece of pure iron. As long as you don't put it in your mouth, you can think of it as basically harmless. If you don't have a deep enough understanding of it, it's hard to imagine the appearance of it, and its amazing power in its small body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with it that humans have for the first time touched the threshold of quality conversion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This step is a new step compared to all previous chemical gunpowders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland roughly counts the number of lead boxes, about 50 or so, aside from the weight of the container, and each box is calculated as one kilogram of storage. It is a full 50 kilograms of uranium 235 with a purity close to 100%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lead cabinet like this has more than one room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you put them all together...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the institute is really "high energy" Alright? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can these gadgets be used to become what you said before? "The nightingale is curious, "made a special machine, or is it ignited?" I always feel that they can't burn. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to know? Roland couldn't help but smile. "It's easier than you think. Just stack the metal blocks in the box and they will automatically emit light and heat." The uranium in this cabinet alone is enough to razor the winter city, so Lucia’s responsibility is great, if the hand shakes -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The scene suddenly fell into a dead silence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia covered her mouth with a look of horror in her eyes.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...No," Ajima was too difficult to channel after a while. "What do you mean, if you are not careful, we may destroy the whole city?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale is a flash of light, grab the lead box in Roland's hand and put it back into the cupboard, then grab his hand and drag it outward.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... Wait, what are you doing? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still asking? "The night rush, "Of course, take you out of the city, and then let people transport these things!" Lucia, go to inform Wendy and ask her to contact the Executive Office! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... I also went to find Your Royal Highness," Achima bit her teeth. "Only she can call the Sleeping Curse." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop - I am joking--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of chicken in the room The flying dog jumped, and Luo Lan took a while to calm everyone down.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure you are just kidding? "The nightingale is not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, of course...I am only talking about the principle," he added quickly. "But actually, to achieve motivation, It's not that easy, even if I do my best, it doesn't necessarily guarantee success. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia sighed. "Your Majesty... You scared my feet." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not so funny," the night glanced at him. "If Wendy and the book hear this, whether it is a joke or not -" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid that you will be asked to move the new institute away from the place without the winter city?" Roland is helpless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know it, or move you to a safe place." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, when I didn't say the words before..." He cleared his throat. "As long as you don't say, Wendy and the book are on." I won't know. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Turn off the news, a bottle of chaotic drink." Roland did not hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete." She blinked and disappeared in front of the three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the stunned Lucia and Achille, Roland shrugged. "Oh... don't care, this is part of the joke."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the nightingale returned to the house, "no suspicious targets, but rewards-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still effective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her expression finally eased, licking the little tune to chew the fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... Your Majesty," Ajima hesitated, only to be dignified. "What you said before, isn’t it all a joke? Because When making rules, you have repeatedly stressed the need to pay attention to weight, and in order to confuse or mishand, you can even control each lead box to exactly four kilograms, and weigh it together with the container, so as to ensure maximum loading. The metal blocks in the box are equal." She paused. "And, if you have an accident at the institute or if someone has broken in, the first thing to do is to inform the guard to block the scene and then return to the castle immediately. Instead of going into the hospital to check the situation. This proves... they do have some danger, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at her unexpectedly,” Good observation. You are basically correct - in addition to toxicity, weight is also one of the key elements, the purpose of separate placement is the same." Can judge the nature of the extract from the rules and regulations, it can be regarded as cautious and meticulous It’s this careful, only Does she wake up with the ability to trace back to the source... "But the weight alone can only jeopardize the Institute, and it wants to turn it into a weapon against the devil, and another thing is needed."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These separate particles?" Ajima quickly reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not exactly, but at least guessed half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingredients for natural uranium mines Very complex, in addition to uranium compounds, it is usually accompanied by a large number of radioactive materials, most of which are secondary products after decay, and some have completely lost radioactivity, becoming stable, and some are still on the road of long decay. Although the radiologists have initially refined the ore during the construction of the cursed temple, the basic components are still roughly the same - this can be seen from the results of Lucia's refinement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most abundant is uranium 238, although it can not be a weapon, but it can be recognized by the ritual cube, the performance is almost no difference with uranium 235, so all sent to the north Poshan backyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is uranium 235. When the purity is over 90%, it can be regarded as a weapon level. The natural content is extremely low, accounting for only 1% of natural uranium. The first difficulty that I want to take on the “璀璨 放射 emissions” route is refining, and this is also a hurdle that most people cannot cross. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is not the rarest - subsequent decay products such as 钍, ra, 氡, 钋, in theory, a race is rare, and Roland needs It is the naturally occurring 钋210, which is also the most common isotope in the 钋 family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a flower of the motherland cultivated in nine-year compulsory education, Roland is familiar with both elements of radium and radon, and Mrs. Curie repeatedly mentioned in the textbook. It was because of the discovery of them and the name is in history. Although the half-life of 钋210 is only a hundred days, and its content is so low that the multiple extractions of Madame Curie have failed, she still has a strong radioactivity from the ore lysate. , pointed out its existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether radium or sputum, can be used to make neutron sources - this is also related to the second difficulty of 璀璨 radiation: detonation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of the first generation of nuclear weapons is very simple, even simple enough to sum up in one sentence: the nuclear fission releases energy. Specific to uranium, uranium 235 is excited to become unstable uranium 236 after receiving a neutron, and then split into two lighter nuclei and more free neutrons, the quality difference between them, It is transformed into energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the released neutrons will hit other nuclides, and the cycle will be a chain reaction, while the huge energy burst and explosion No different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
