			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, don't worry, this is not my blood." Nana Wa took off her robes with the help of the bell. "Just the wounded were just milled." The arm was broken and the scene was inevitably a bit confusing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, is that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Yes. Come, let me see your injury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong gas field, the other party is really the same age...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Momo swallowed, carefully removed the blindfold and slowly walked over to Nanawa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s about the same as Wendy’s sister, the next magic should be enough.” After the girl checked, she handed her a bowl of potion. Then, I patted the bed around me. "Come on after you have finished drinking. It will take about ten minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momo did, but stunned to see each other I took out a knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, squat... Wendy..." She turned to the two people who looked for help, and the voice had been crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Nana," Wendy said helplessly. "You can't come slowly, adapt the newly added sisters to the time?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, but this is the normal process," Nana Wa surprised. "If you don't cut the old wound and completely destroy the healing area, the treatment will not be sent." It has taken effect."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true that you can say this, but you can chat with her first..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... talk about the previous case? I feel that using a saw is more convenient than cutting an axe when cutting a limb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No I don't mean this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's true," Roland also interjected. "The saw can ensure that the section is basically neat, but if it is like a leg bone If you have a big bone, is it too laborious to open it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The skull is not so good, the strength of the female nurse is not much bigger than me. If there is Anna It’s much easier to help.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’m negligent. But this is not difficult to solve. Looking back, how do I design the electric for you? Broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! Please don't say this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, sorry When I talk about technical issues, I can't help it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Momo turned his head and saw that Nana Wa seemed to be talking to her, Wendy, and from time to time with the knife in her hand, like It is to be tested on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cut off? Saw? ax? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry... She slowly closed her eyes more and more... Dylan, I may not see you after this treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, she slept." Roland suddenly noticed the bed. Momo has closed his eyes and entered a smooth sleep state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa raised the scalpel and nodded to the two. "So I started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; I saw her skillfully cut along the eyelids, cut off the ugly old wounds and cleaned the run-down skin, the blood quickly leached, and dyed the pre-placed gauze. Throughout the process, her arms are almost the same as static, only the fingertips and wrists are precisely adjusted. Unlike treatment, this step cannot be achieved by magic. It is the result of Nana's training so far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's amazing..." Wendy whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she developed a style that didn't drag on the water... Roland couldn't help but feel a little emotion. "In the past, you will be dizzy when you see the blood, and those chickens-"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty!" Nanawa gave him a blank look. "The time is not to mention it! And the culprit is that you are right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Well," Roland waved his hand to show his surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's more..." The little girl paused. "I think this is not bad. At least compared to the past, I am a lot stronger... yes. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such an instant, she seems to be layered with the appearance of her memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but reach out and touch her head, "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minutes After that, Momo’s eyes returned to the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effect of a bowl of sleeping ferns can last for about two hours. This toxicity does not affect the witch too much, so wait for her natural Wake up." Nana Wa looked at Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Working hard." The latter smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, how much is your magic left?" Roland deliberately pretended to be inadvertently said, "Can you check it for me?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty couldn’t help but change, and Nanawa grabbed his arm directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you injured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... I just think that old people are prone to stuffy nose. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you should find Lily." Nana Wa did not breathe back to the hand. "Checked, the ability did not respond." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too." Roland slightly turned his head and avoided Wendy's doubtful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Nana's ability is not omnipotent... He wonders, she doesn't know that she can't heal the "hidden illness" that she can't see, or The red unhealthy state is not a kind of injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I can only wait and explore later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Momo slowly opens his eyes, it’s exactly what’s in the eye A red glow. The overlapping clouds are turning from gold to purple, drifting away from the afterglow. The ear is the rustling sound of the autumn wind blowing through the grass, soft but continuous, and occasionally can see one or two blades of grass rising from the sky, swaying across the cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything looks peaceful and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was still alive...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Momo quickly noticed the anomaly, and the vision in his eyes seemed to expand a lot, and the visions that were usually blurred became clear and identifiable. She raised her head slightly and found that Dai Lan was leaning over and smiling at her. "Are you awake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momo noticed that he had been Pillows on the partner's lap, and the two are in the same position as the lawn in front of the witch building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long have I slept? Wendy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She handed you over After I gave it to me, I left." Dylan shrugged. "You probably slept for half an afternoon. Although Wendy said that you can wake up in an hour, you don't have to worry if you exceed it. This is after the magic is restored. Common symptoms, naturally wake up the body will be more adaptable. How, new eyes ... can see things?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Momo sat up, Repeatedly looking at the world around me, since she was dug her eyes, she thought she would have fallen into the dark forever, and she did not expect to have a day of regaining her light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do, Dailan..." she whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
