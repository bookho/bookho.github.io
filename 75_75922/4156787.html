			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could it be - astrolabe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland had come back to God for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the core of the sorcerer, this kind of thing usually only appears in pure magic creatures and gods. Ordinary martial artists are not their opponents at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the martial arts associations concentrate and plan carefully, they may also have the opportunity to kill such enemies, but they will never hand the stars to their hands so casually. . Sending by courier is a dangerous thing that may infect others at any time. This is a near-fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not sent by the association, but who is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland checked the shipping address and phone number, both of which were fabricated. The only credible number is the single number, indicating that the piece is from the same city and is obviously sent. The person does not want to be known by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that this behavior is equally unclear to the other party. The courier company does not review the true identity of the sender just to reduce costs, it is really easy to check it. Make up an address to hide the trail? In modern society, this is almost impossible. By investigating and monitoring the receivers, it is generally possible to lock in the target soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you want to use the power of the association to trace the sender, Roland is somewhat hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the result, the other party obviously knows his details and has a certain kindness to him, otherwise he will not send such a tricky thing to the package. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, the weakening of the erosion force for him should always be the person on the same front. Since the other party does not want to be exposed, it may be better to keep the status quo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland's forehead, decided to think about this headache later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more important thing now is to deal with the front of the chart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his attention back to the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the astrolabe comes from a cracked monster, then it can be directly merged, but if it comes from God, does it mean...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, how could this be, Roland laughed. It is already exaggerated to be able to get rid of cracked monsters. God is not so good to deal with enemies. Even if Fiji is cold, you can only support it. You should not imagine that such a beautiful thing is better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his hand on the chart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is like Susheng from a static time, the blue-white spot begins to rotate again, and the center is getting brighter and brighter until a ray of light is shining. And out - at this point, everything is normal, just like the many fusion scenes he has witnessed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the next second, the world suddenly fell into darkness, and a lot of consciousness flooded into his mind, and there was unbearable pain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the storm of the stormy waves, Roland almost lost consciousness - it was hard to stabilize his mind, and when all the time subsided, he opened his eyes again. I found myself standing in a void. Snowflakes still exist, but in the third experience, the brain seems to be able to filter those unrelated noises better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Okay, it’s really true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this must be checked for the identity of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled his mouth and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is still the background of the universe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the surroundings are too empty, he can’t be sure for a while. Compared with the last episode of consciousness, this time it is obviously darker, as if the stars are hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a while for Roland to find a reference point from a sparse piece of snowflake - a dim light that is about to be extinguished, embedded It is as small as a needle tip on a black background. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this, he is not sure if he is in the universe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because those light clusters are neatly arranged and evenly spaced, it is not like what natural celestial bodies can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ask you, what is gravity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Roland’s eyes when watching The sound that suddenly sounded behind him made his hair erect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned sharply, only to notice that there was no more gray shadow when the other side was erratic, as if there was no entity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, this is not a language that he is familiar with, and even if it is a language, it is difficult to determine. Although he didn't understand the reason, he realized that the content of the map in his mind was simplified - just as the other party sent out a complex electromagnetic wave, but it was filtered by the filter, leaving only the content that he could understand. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you asking me?" Roland asked cautiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gravity is the most admirable force in the world." Another voice in consciousness replied, and this sound sounded familiar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but rolled his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there was a sudden startle, and then I secretly asked questions. He thought he was involved in this episode, but he was still only one. Bystanders only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it's universal, solid, and more grand, bigger..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It allows the shackles to condense and make the emptiness form. So life can take root and the civilization can survive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound gradually becomes full of rhythm, just like singing in the air . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the power that each ethnic group first recognizes is also gravitation--it is both a cradle and a shackle, a history of progress in civilization, that is The history of the struggle to get rid of gravity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the departure of the earth to the sky, to the farther places, this is not the case."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, it has once again become our obstacle and the last obstacle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The risk cannot be estimated, I don't recommend implementing a door plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every step is accompanied by risk, you should be aware of this."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clear. So my suggestion hasn't changed since the beginning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you still helped me with it." Gray The picture flashed twice. "For this plan, I have been waiting for a thousand years, let it start now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. What is the door plan? ? What is the final obstacle? Roland felt that he had missed any key information. He could open his mouth and think about it. No matter how he asked, the interlocutor did not respond to his call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗞..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voices in my mind, the snowflake pieces have become more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to past experience, when the clip is nearing the end, the flow rate of time should be faster, and it is difficult for him to make an accurate judgment without the reference. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland saw that the light groups began to move closer to the center spontaneously, but their brightness did not increase and fell, and soon became dark. The rest of the light group is like a moth, and it is thrown into the darkness. It doesn't stop at all. In the end, how many sinks can't be calculated. This process seems to be extraordinarily long, and it seems to be extraordinarily long--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a limit is broken, a dazzling red light suddenly bursts in the darkness, and across the world in the blink of an eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
