			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the vision was pulled from the sky to the ground, there was no change in the sight of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, the more things that come into your eyes, the more realistic it is – whether it’s a bustling market where people come and go, or a magnificent palace. Everything makes Victor look at it. If he is not worried about causing "any third-party loss," he even wants to stand up and touch the king's throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclamation in the hall is one after another, the audience seems to have lost the ability of the language, can only express the shocking meaning of the heart with a short cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any change in any scene can cause a slap in the face--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long princess debuts, "Oh ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four-year-old wolf, "Wow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different Kings visit, "喔喔喔喔!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to run out of control, the thunder and lightning thundered the palace, and everyone was even more exclaimed, the voice was as loud as it was to open The floor is general! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When watching the traditional drama of quiet and gentle, the voice in the theater has never stopped from start to finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor knows that this has nothing to do with the literacy of the audience, purely to ease the extremely contradictory emotions in the heart - they are eager to appreciate the unheard of Scenery, but full of fear of the scene that is too realistic. Therefore, they can only shout out, only then, they know that they are not alone in this illusion, there are many people around, or together to share this shock! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Roland is present, you will understand that this is just another form of "bouncer body." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this shouting, the princess turned into a giant wolf and devoted herself to the snowfield - when her huge body crossed the head, Vic I often feel that the scalp is numb, and I can hardly help but want to take the road and escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a high-pitched song slid into his ear, which made him settle down instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All uneasy emotions dissipated, replaced by strong grievances, unwillingness, liberation, perseverance... Several emotions alternated, Victor was actually a moment Tears! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be empathetic with the long princess who was forced to flee, sad for the misunderstanding of everyone, and proud of this courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful songs and scenes are transformed, and even with each movement of the people in the play, the beautiful voice makes him feel excited, the description of the lyrics is more like His own portrayal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who has not been misunderstood in this life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But most people can only choose to endure silently! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Victor’s fear of the wolf woman no longer exists, but instead she is free from her shackles! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the other party, he seems to see himself away from home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly a great song, but the combination of song and drama can be so perfect, and there is no sense of ignorance at all. He felt the feeling of coordination for the first time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applause from the scene can be known, not only him, this scene of the drama touched everyone’s heart and pushed the atmosphere in the hall since the opening The climax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, Victor had already judged the new drama in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no exaggeration in the promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely an art that transcends the times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when the song rang, Karkin knew that he had lost to Mey - not his personal failure, but the new drama was completely defeated in the face of "Wolf Heart". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how good it is, the drama is meant to be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, he still had the time to shock "How is this possible" and "How did she do this?" It was not long before she fell into numbness. This so-called demon shadow completely overturns the common sense he has accumulated over the past few decades, and has stepped on all existing rules. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spectators in the field are considered to be picky enough, but their visions are not as good as those of the old aristocrats who have been immersed for a long time. It is not easy to impress them. But at the moment, these people are all around, just like the villagers who have never seen the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this can't blame them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is not trying to restrain himself, he will not help but shout out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new drama prepared by the Kajin Theatre Company can never do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you put the two together, anyone will have the same conclusion: "Wolf" is more exciting, and much more exciting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does they not see the mistakes and omissions made by the actors? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they can completely ignore these issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Cardin is clear, the information that people receive at the same time is limited, and the Shadows provide a very rich amount of information, even reaching the point of view. Degree. In this case, even if you make the next two small mistakes, it is difficult to attract the attention of the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is this an unfair contest? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kajin naturally does not think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows more about the development of the drama than he does. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which actor always favors large theaters, precisely because the latter has enough financial resources to provide better clothing, props and scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things are also an indispensable element of a wonderful drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His teacher is famous for moving large backgrounds to the stage - the detachable wooden house invented in its peak It was even more popular. From then on, all the troupes rushed to imitate, and today they have the drama pattern. If an actor is left in the air, he will not think that it is a perfect performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scene layout has always been moving closer to the immersive and refined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Star Flower Troupe is just doing this to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The card gold that came to this conclusion relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned on the soft lounge chair and gave a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, you can concentrate on enjoying this rare drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the story came to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness fades, and the chairs, pillars, and ground reappear in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one got up and left, everyone seems to be still immersed in the illusory mountain capital, reminiscent of the thrilling battle between the wolf princess and the devil lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kajin. Fez was the first to applaud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This applause is like awakening the audience, followed by the second, third... More people raised their hands, and soon the intensive applause From childhood to Dalian, it is like a storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
