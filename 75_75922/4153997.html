			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three options in front of Roland. One is to use the opportunity created by Wakiris to set up a murder of Heckzod. The risk is almost zero, which is equivalent to a demon monarch under the empty gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering the difficulty of higher-level promotion and the special ability of Hecksod, this benefit for the front line is real. After that, the reason why the other party failed to make an appointment was pushed to the accident or something else, and Wakiris might not be able to see anything from it. If you are lucky enough, you may be able to lure other Maharajas in the same way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is to let Heckzod enter the dream and have a face-to-face conversation with Vakiris. Since the latter has taken the initiative to move forward a step forward, the key point is not the nightmare itself, but the rapper. The most ideal situation is that the nightmare verifies the reality and then convinces the Scorpio Lord to lead the army to withdraw from the human kingdom and spread the information that "the war of divine war must be suspended" to the devil's group. In this way, the path from the eternal winter to the bottomless world will be unimpeded. As long as the last sacred god is eliminated, he can face the gods in the bottomless world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is just a war between humans and demons, Roland will undoubtedly choose the former, after all, killing Heckzord is a matter of making a profit. The battlefield in the north can also gain a greater advantage. The longer the time drags, the more fully the industrialized war potential can be exerted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But zooming in on the whole picture will make the situation very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the devil and the heavens and the sea, the threat of the gods is close at hand, and the Lord of Scorpio has become an insignificant result. Even if you win the battle of God, human civilization can't escape the end of destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least Roland couldn’t think of it, to what extent to survive in the face of such a terrible natural disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is not on their side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About seeing this, Wajilis chose to take this risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has to be said that this practice reveals a certain degree of sincerity - at least after witnessing the erosion and the attack of God, it has already regarded the warning of embarrassment as one The first big thing to seriously consider. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the enlightenment of the miracle here is very influential. It can be said that before the war of divine war has not completely broken out, it is This thought was planted in the mind of Vakiris. Being able to temporarily put aside the victory or defeat of a war, and from a higher perspective to fight for the continuation of ethnic groups can be said to be a matter of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Hecksod has no experience in this area, and whether it is possible to reach an agreement with Wakiris after the exchange is still a question. Generally speaking, this choice about ethnic destiny may not be determined by a negotiation. The more times you meet in a dream, the more the risk will multiply. This is also the unacceptable place for Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, he prefers the third option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to maintain the status quo temporarily, and strive to reach the end of the mainland with the power of mankind itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, this choice is most in line with Roland’s appetite and the goal he has been striving for – no matter how the devil reacts, humans have crossed thousands The ability of a kilometer to reach the destination is undoubtedly the surest result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just north of Yongdong, which is a mountainous terrain. If you want to cross the continental spine, you must develop an aircraft with a range far greater than the Skyfire. The ability to protect against air attacks. From research and development to production, this process will undoubtedly take a lot of time, and it is also unknown whether the frontline situation will change during this period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he has previously realized - in the face of the threat of divine, choosing to be safe is also an adventure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only difference from the first two choices is that the degree of risk of this choice can be more or less dependent on human efforts to make up for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you enter the dream next time, try to seek support from the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
