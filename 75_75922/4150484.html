			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is an easy job, you don't have to take any risks, just put the message in the appointed position, no one knows that you have done these things. The words of the person in charge of the black money, who wears a silver mask, echoed in the ear again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s ridiculous! Why should I help the Grey Fortress? They have to be evenly removed from the aristocrats. What good is it for me if I win?" Still vividly, "I thought that black money is a shrewd businessman. I didn't expect to say this stupid thing! You are not afraid that I will tie you up and hand it over to Ma Weien, so that I can get a reward for it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you really want to do this, then there will be no such scenes at the beginning." The tone of the other party did not change at all, as if they did not care about themselves. In general, "I can still sit here, it is enough to prove your wishes. Just because you are a smart person, we are willing to provide this opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It's a pity that you got it wrong. I have no doubt about the loyalty of the Duke. Let's roll now, I haven't changed my mind before!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am Go. But adults, the so-called opportunity is like this, the black money has no intention of forcing you to make a choice, how to It’s your freedom.” The silver-faced man stood up and bowed to him first, then gently placed a black card on the tea table. “The last thing I want to convey is that the gray fort is not I will forget anyone who has worked for it. Then... there will be a period."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleet took a deep breath and interrupted the chaotic thoughts, and the room suddenly quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not forget anyone who has worked for the Grey Fort... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s ironic that he was trying to reinvigorate the glory of the family before he became the Duke of Maween, and Roland Wimbledon, who was enemies of all nobles, was the least likely Forgiveness, but now, he finds that he has some uncertain ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy sent by the black money, although mixed, can be a bit correct, if he really intends to play for the Duke of the North, then this should have been The card is torn apart, not to carefully hide it under the drawer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long silence, Fowler sighed and sat down at the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled out a white paper and spread it out, then picked up the quill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else can you lose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting back to the territory has become more and more embarrassing, he does not seem to have a hard time sticking to the scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, anyway, according to the practice of black money, you will not have any loss, just bet on both sides. If the devil wins the final victory, the status quo will not get worse anyway. If the Grey Fortress wins, he may be able to get compensation in other ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Fowler dropped the pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, he wore a trench coat and a felt hat and walked inside. The horn alley in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the site of the Northern Chamber of Commerce. Most of the visitors are businessmen. When the sun sets, there are few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a gentle slope, Fowler found the place mentioned by the silver-faced man - in the middle of two brick houses, with a large silver fir tree . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the way the other party agreed to deliver is also the reason that prompted him to make a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no recipients, and there are no dockers, which greatly reduces the risk. At least he didn't have to worry about the black money holding the information in turn to marry him, or being noticed by others, he had a close relationship with the unidentified person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fouler spent a while in the vicinity, and after seeing no suspicious people around, he quickly came to the back of the silver fir and touched the tree hole in the center - sure enough, The secret hole in the tree hole is hidden, but the door is completely ordinary wood. It is hard to detect it without touching it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
