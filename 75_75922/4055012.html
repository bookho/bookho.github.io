			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that there’s no point in worrying now, even if it’s eye-catching, she’s going to act with four people – this is the closest observation of the city and the witch alliance. Good opportunity. Otherwise, when they enter the castle area, it will be many times more difficult to contact them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, on the 76th, Wendy showed a slightly pleasant smile, "Ma...it bothers you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that Wendy wouldn't mind," Amy grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Anne seems to have something, she looks at the two, no more talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go," Wendy clap his hands and laughed until the hero was a little familiar with the wheelchair operation. "The first stop of today's visit, no core of the winter city." Area, North Slope Mine!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Mine...Mountain?” Five people gathered together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is good looking for mining? On the 76th, there was such a thought in the mind, and she bet that other people should think about it as much as herself. Whether in Takira or in the morning kingdom, mining is carried out by slaves or prisoners. The environment in the mine is extremely poor. In addition to the heavy physical activity of excavation and transportation, death and injury are normal things. Only those who have no value in life will be thrown into the mine to fend for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty of the other party’s intention is to teach them to tell them that this newcomer does not follow the discipline of corrections? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s better to say that there is no source of winter power, even in the mine," Wendy’s tone did not mean a hint of intimidation. "Who can produce more?" More steel, who is more representative of justice, this is also a word that is always on the lips. Very mouthful, right?" On the contrary, when she talks about the king, there is always a smile in her eyes. "In short, you will understand when you see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representative...justice? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventy-sixth heart has repeatedly pondered this sentence several times, what is the relationship between the two? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the diplomatic building, the snow on the street has been cleaned up, and I don’t know what the locals used. The snowpack in the hills is only left. A beach of water stains. The new snowflake is still falling, but it is much smaller than a few days ago. Busy free people can be seen everywhere, they seem to have a lot of busy life, walking in a hurry, facing the snow through the streets. It is obviously a harsh winter of evil, and the whole city is full of a vibrant taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colorful magic stone heated up again, she looked around and quickly found the target - there were two figures on the top... No, it was one person The birds are shaking, probably to monitor them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Witch Alliance’s evaluation in the mind of the 76th has risen again. This means and rigor is almost the same as the small city state in the Takilla era. The associations are almost the same, not at all like the wild witch organization of the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also she also confirmed that her judgment was correct - with the perspective of a green-haired witch, coupled with the flight witch’s tracking, she could not be exposed Escape from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes on the road, I will briefly introduce you to some knowledge of the witch’s own ability," the red-haired witch led the crowd all the way north. As he walked, he said, "When I wake up, the witch is faced with the magical rebellion. The church once called it a demon phagosome. In fact, it is just a natural reaction of the growing magic. You should already know this." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Anne nodded calmly. "It’s hard to live through adulthood without knowing it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I heard it from the broken sword," Amy said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you are wandering in the wild, you will always have the ability to use it. I was just guessing it," the sword was a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The same was true for the club, but we managed to hold it down," Wendy exclaimed. "Once the adulthood, the original ability of the witch will be further strengthened. And the opportunity to create a branching ability, the specific performance is that the magic vortex of the body becomes clear and strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
