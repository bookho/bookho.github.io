			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rex, who had been waiting for this, extended two fingers, first pointing to the top of the finger and then pointing to the depth of the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbadi made a clear gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former nodded and turned to walk inside the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and stared at the gas pipe suspended above the other side of the head - three days of underwater walking, in addition to familiar with the basic operation of diving suits, is also learning sign language And the process of diving details. The state of observing the two trachea at any time is even more important, which is one of the reasons why salvage requires two people to collaborate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a channel to maintain breathing, the other end of the tube is connected to a steam engine-driven air pump, while pumping in while pumping out, so that the air in the helmet is always Keep it open. No matter which tube is damaged or blocked, the consequences are unimaginable. Therefore, when passing through complex terrain and changing direction, you must pay special attention to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the top of the cave and there is nothing to threaten the obstacles of the gas pipeline, Simbadi also jumped into the water hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surge of the ear suddenly reduced a lot, he could clearly hear the snoring of the valve and his heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about ten meters, the light became darker and darker, looking at the blurred back of Rex in front, he felt like he was heading towards the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the ground under the foot suddenly lifted up, from a flat road to a gentle slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a quarter of an hour, Sinbaddi saw the sea again - it was no longer flashing, but as quiet as night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Rex slowly rising to the surface, he could not help but hold his breath, only to see a large cave in front of the two. Most of its outlines are hidden in the darkness, and only a small area of ​​the dome is illuminated by the light reflected from the sea, revealing the faint blue of the ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This water hole is actually a passage between inside and outside? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struggled to climb ashore and was about to remove the helmet, but was stopped by Rex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fjord took a waterproof oil lamp from his pocket, and after igniting the wick, he observed it for a while before picking up the helmet. "Call... It seems that this is not here. A piece of dead land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there... wind?" Simbadi felt the coolness of brushing his cheeks after he released the hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, there are still other exits in the cave." Rex exclaimed. "So, the possibility of finding treasures here is great. A few points - our luck is really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddy is not interested in finding good things, he cares more about the hole. Security situation. I didn't expect that there would be hollow terrain under the desert, which is beyond common sense. The depth of their dive will not exceed 20 meters. Even if there are rock formations, they will not be too thick. How do the loose sands support a large cave? Will the dome collapse? These questions have made him faintly uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went out, I still reported this discovery to the Grey Fortress. Sinbaddi thought, although I couldn’t help but wonder, but here Daqing Port is not far away. He does not want any accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The wind seems to be coming from that direction," Rex put the helmet on the edge of the pool and lifted the oil lamp. "Let's see it in the past." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddy had to pull out his waist knife and slowly followed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the exploration progressed, he only felt that the cave was more and more strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock under the foot did not turn into a soft soil for a long time, then a cluster of green grass replaced the slippery moss, as if it was not underground, but Yinchuan oasis in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Inconceivable, green leaf plants can grow here," Rex exclaimed. "I thought that there would be mushrooms and moss in the dark ground. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he said half of it, he suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think of this?" Rex didn't get an answer for a long time, and couldn't help but look back. "Well? What are you looking at... a flower?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbad said that he only felt a little bit of breathing, and there was a beautiful flower at his feet, the petals were lavender, and the leaves were almost As thin as a flap, it seems to be broken when it is pinched. "This is... the flower of God..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very rare?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No... It used to be everywhere.” Simbadi whispered, “I haven’t seen it with my own eyes, but in the legend about the messenger of the Three Gods, this flower is spread all over the coast, like a purple ribbon. It is also the most beautiful flower sea in the extreme south."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a flower sea in the desert?" Rex muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" According to legend, it was not a desert long ago, but it was like trees, grasslands and rivers in the north." He shook his head, "but with the messengers of the three gods." The departure of the earth gradually became deserted and became what it is today. But what I want to say is not this - God made the flower in the legend with a very detailed account, once it takes root, it can no longer move, this is not in the oasis. The reason for Huahai. It should have been extinct before..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was still such a thing." The fjord snorted, "Maybe It is precisely because the desertification does not affect the underground cavity that the gods who happen to be rooted in it have survived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it... Simba Di's heart is getting stronger and stronger. I don't know why, walking in this dark world, he has the feeling of walking on an oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple flowers around are gradually denser, not at all like accidentally growing underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he hesitated to move on, there was a sudden bang in his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a soft light that blooms out of the earth and illuminates the range of a few meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Rex asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I seem to have stepped on something," Sinbaddi swallowed. "It seems like a piece of wood."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a trap?" He leaned down and handed the flowers around his feet. "This is--ha, haha...hahaha..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the laughter in the hole, Sinbad felt that the hair was erected. "What's so funny, hello, you tell me what it is!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hahaha, it’s a treasure! We found treasures!" Rex exclaimed. "You look!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he lifted the soil all over, Sinbaddi was surprised to see that the light came from the bottom of his feet - it was a "stone" buried halfway down the ground, spreading Numerous lines are densely packed like fingerprints. The light shines out from the center of his foot, and the monument is shaped like white jade. Although it seems to be hard and hard, its touch is like decaying wood, and it will fall a little under a little force, completely beyond the scope of common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s even more ridiculous is that once you remove your foot, the surface of the tablet will gradually return to its original state, and the light will dissipate as if you just saw it. Everything is an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are more magical treasures than this!" Rex repeatedly stepped on the "stone tablet" and said with exultation, "If you can give this to the Grey Fortress The king, the honorary explorer title is absolutely not mys!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... it is too big," said Simbadi, the light is exposed From this small piece of view, the whole "stone tablet" is likely to be larger than the two of them. It is not easy to move out of the water hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The way is what people think, as long as they use more brains, they will find a way. Or we can go to another exit of the cave - 咦?" Ks suddenly stopped. "There seems to be another piece."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
