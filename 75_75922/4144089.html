			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Danny took the gun, the first feeling was that its center of gravity had changed, and the whole was actually a bit heavy - if not to see The second tube, which is next to the barrel, is essentially a very common bolting rifle, which is the same as that used by most soldiers in the gun camp. From the point of view of workmanship, it is obviously not as good as the precision rifle that I used. The most striking change is that the metal tube on the side extends all the way to the body of the gun and is connected to the bolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this should be the key to the ability of weapons to be issued, Danny thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned over the target and buckled the trigger, but his eyes did not look directly at the muzzle as usual, but instead stared at the side of the gun Iron pipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tremor of the pop-up, the incredible scene happened - although everything happened between the blinks, Danny, who is a marksman, still looks It is the whole process of changing the bolt. Almost at the same time as the gunshot, the hidden long rod in the iron pipe seemed to be pushed out by something, and the metal arc piece at the end was pushed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arc is connected to the pull bolt. According to common sense, the bolt in the locked state cannot be pulled out. If it comes hard, the result is either a back stop or a long shot break. However, the pull bolt springs up along the trajectory of the center of the arc, releasing the locked state and smoothly withdrawing from the shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, it is a completely reverse process, the long rod is retracted into the tube, and the pull bolt is reset, and the bolt head falls along the arc again to the bottom end. , re-locked the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a wonderful design! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny secretly sighs that this part can be seen at a glance, even a layman like him can understand the principle at a glance. Simply put, it is to use the long rod in the second iron pipe to replace the hand movement. The ingenious thing is that the long pole only relies on straight forward and backward, and realizes four changes of lifting, pulling, pushing and pressing, and automatically completes the next round of shooting preparation without user intervention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the rise, he shot all the remaining bullets out, smelling the fascinating smell of smoke, and the long-lost sound came to his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nineteen missing one, there is a loss of transmission." Malt chuckled. "Why, is it not easy to use new weapons?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven't adapted yet. If you don't believe it, I will show you the target in the next round."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... don't believe what?" A surprised voice came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny is suddenly coming back to God. He is not on the battlefield at the moment, but in a shooting training field surrounded by a group of people. He looked up and looked at the captain of the inexplicable artillery battalion. He pretended to shake his head as if nothing had happened. "No... I just talked to myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The results of the twenty-nine guns and nineteens are unsatisfied. It is worthy of being the first striker of the first army." Fanna patted the other's shoulder and asked with expectation, "So... what do you think of this gun?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny also knows a little about the "fight fight" between the artillery battalion and the musket, but it is all for his Majesty, he does not want to hide himself from the new The weapon's appreciation, "In addition to stability and weight, it is almost impeccable. If you can, I hope that the precision shooting team's weapons can be similarly modified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; In terms of accuracy, at least on the 50-meter target and the 100-meter target, its performance is not much worse than the ordinary rifle. The increased weight is not conducive to standing shooting and gun charge, but that is not a problem that precision shooters need to consider, which should be the same for artillery battalions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to shoot continuously is the biggest advantage of the new weapon - in the case of a miss, the action of pulling the bolt will cause the head to shift When the muzzle is lifted up, it takes time to re-lock the opponent through the scope. It is also common to lose the original target, which makes each fire interval much higher than the ordinary soldiers. But the musket in the test can obviously improve this point. He only needs to adjust the muzzle slightly, and he can immediately make up the corrected second bullet. Especially when the enemy is swarming, he can almost imagine a quick point. The scene of killing the group goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this comment, Fanner couldn’t help but open his mouth. "At the moment, this is just an immature design. If you can help us improve this together, Weapons, I will be more confident when I apply to the Iron Man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
