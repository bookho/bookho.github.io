			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jo was taken out of the room and set foot on the bow deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the site of Count Lorenzo?" asked Sean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden antenna of the sea antenna that reflects the morning sun, a gray and white shadow floating on it, faintly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt the heart tighten in an instant, and he couldn’t help but grab the railing and lean forward to find himself missing a detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, that is Dagong Island!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is finally back, with rescue - <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina, please hold on for a while! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are two docks on the island, which are facing east-west." Joe took a deep breath and couldn’t wait to say, "Since Lorenzo is self-proclaimed as a nobleman." Afterwards, there were guards guarded in the dock area. However, mainly to prevent other nobles of the wolf heart, the merchant ships were not strictly investigated. The problem lies in the castle area, where the alert situation is extremely strict, there is no proof of the license, and the company does not enter. Go--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can be said to be broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two days, Kajin Fez asked him many questions, but not to inquire about the secrets of the church, not even one related to the action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his prejudice and insult to Farina, until later escape, work, mutual help, are extremely careful, when the language is not good, the card Kim even asked his disciple Roentin to play Farina, trying to restore the scenes in his memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides eating time, he couldn’t even see Sean and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s as if they didn’t care about the rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it’s hard to catch this opportunity, and Joe uses the fastest speed to pour out the thoughts in his heart – no matter if the other person will listen, but There is a place to use, it is equal to the opportunity to rescue Farina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't require you to worry about it, we have our own way," Sean interrupted. "I am going to let you see you." One person, familiar with it beforehand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This trip The guide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he whistled and the two sailors quickly took a middle-aged man and came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiao recognized who the other person was at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hag, you traitor--!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also a believer in the sacred institution Before Hagrid was transferred to assist Bishop Lorenzo, he was still his superior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Hagrid dismissed. "It means you are more loyal to the church. If Farina knows that you are in the Grey Fort, this traitor The word doesn't know who it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Joe said it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dispute is not necessary." Sean stood between the two. "Mr. Hagrid, should you know your mission?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the king’s guard, Hagrid’s voice immediately went down a lot. “Yes, adults, bring the two soldiers into the castle.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is your only chance of atonement. If you can grasp it, you will see yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no problem entering the castle. Can you be an adult, are you sure that only two are enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe stunned for a while and then recovered. So, no matter how many people Hagrid brought, it is an intolerable betrayal for Lorenzo. If the gray castle fails, he also has no good fruit to eat. I hope that the latter can do a little bit more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, you will see it soon--" Sean looked at the contoured Dagong Island and sneered. "They are gaining strength." The complete body is the true god of war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the rescue team left the dock with six talents and headed for the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to Zoe and Betty, there are two First Army soldiers to follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they are obviously responsible for guarding Joe and Hagrid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Earl's confidant himself as a "guide", it can be said that it is unimpeded along the way. Even if the patrol came up for cross-examination, he would be sent out in a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of the guards at the entrance to the castle wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the remaining five were wearing hoods, the guards did not ask much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From this point of view, Hagrid is indeed deeply trusted by Lorenzo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After passing through the courtyard, the Lord's Castle appeared in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Hagrid, Farina’s attack scared the Count of Lorenzo, and he concentrated all the gods who could still act. In the bedroom of the main building, the number will not exceed six. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the bedroom door was replaced by a solid door made of red copper. It is said that the average person can't even push the push, let alone break the lock. Usually want to enter and exit, they all rely on the gods to open the bronze door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not difficult to swind Lorenzo out of the bedroom, just say that you have discovered the secret of the treasure." Hagrid said as he walked, "but he will necessarily bring God's martial arts action, and the presence of strangers in the hall will make the guards feel wary and have to find a way to pass them-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you only Tell us that the bedroom is on a few floors," Zoe shrugged. "Then go to the dungeon with Joe and rescue the woman. As for how we fight, it has nothing to do with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagrid slammed down and said, "Yes... I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was just getting a bow tie and boarding the stone steps. Tap the side door. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; a janitor old man stuck his head out, "Hagrid turned out to be an adult, how do you not come back to bother to say -" <br /> < Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Less nonsense, I have something to report to the Earl, let go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, good... ... "the other side quickly leaned son, let out a passage," but these people are ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" I arranged the cage liner in the mountains of how you. Want to inquire about the secrets of the Earl of the Earl?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't dare!" The old man immediately bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the room from the side door and passing through the two partition walls, the pedestrian entered the interior of the castle. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; waited at the door of the hall, he has replaced the family dressed in armor guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When someone appeared, the two guards held their hilts around their waists and came together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lorenzo's bedroom is on the fourth floor...but I can't take you up..." Hagrid said in a low voice. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "?.? yo, this is not the Earl Haig adults, it has recently been talking about it these are the names of your guests that you got from it," the guards had a row Etiquette, turned to Zoe and others, "Please wait outside the hall, unless you get permission from the Earl - and so on, this lady -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hagrid, this is--" Another person is the same, too late to pull out the sword, Betty's big hand has been caught in his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咔嚓."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sizzle, the head and neck of the guard suddenly twisted A corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagrid and Joe couldn’t help but breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one hand, you can break your neck. Is this something that people can do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the two are more than that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked into the hall with the guards and blocked their bodies behind them. This weird scene made the remaining guards fail to respond in the first place. Come over, "Hey, what are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... No, you see, their feet are not falling!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim light affects everyone's attention, and when they realize that something is wrong, it is already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zoe and Betty flashed like a shadow to the unguarded guards, aiming at the neck outside the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long vigil is easy to let people relax, and their opponents are the most powerful warriors among human beings - the extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe couldn’t help but hold his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only a few interest rates, and the remaining four guards are also twisted and twisted, and they fall to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This overwhelming power and speed, he only saw it in the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the gods are clearly a group of monsters with no thought ability. It is not difficult to tear the enemy. It is necessary to kill the opponent silently and subtly. What can't be done! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the same shock on Hagrid’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They have gained full power and are true gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe The middle voice rang what Shawn said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also... the masterpiece of Roland Wimbledon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not sure that His Majesty is the one who knows the secret the most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, according to the plan," Zoe glanced at Joe. "Whether the person you want to save is dead or alive, you must not stay in the dungeon. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting the answer, the two turned Run towards the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no guard guard in the stairwell. Zoe and Betty climbed up to the fourth floor. I saw a narrow doorway with a door on both sides. It should be Prepared for a maid or servant. At the end of the walkway, it is filled with a huge metal threshold, reflecting the dark red light under the swaying candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a red bronze door." Zoe raised an eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do?" Betty whispered. "If there is a lock on the back, I think it should be impossible to open."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that still used? If there is no way, then open up a path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I want to...also."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty kicked the wooden door next to the main bedroom and strode into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah--" a scream rang, and the maid, who was only wearing a tulle, yanked the quilt and covered the half-baked chest. "You, Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
