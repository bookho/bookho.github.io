"Is there any problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks Going up is similar to some of the things I've killed before," said the nightingale. "It's just that the monsters are much smaller than this, and there is no such exaggerated shape..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Wait, you mean the investigation of Da Xueshan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night nodded, "Early when searching for ice witches. Invisible From this point of view, it seems to be convinced that being a ghost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The difference between these two monsters is where you can say more in detail. "Roland asked." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... let me think about it, after all, it was a few years ago." The nightingale picked up the picture. "The guy I met was at most only The monster is half high, and the front paws are sickle-shaped, just shrinking for a few laps; the abdomen is only used for rock climbing, and there are not so many claws. As for the head... Yes, the claw beast was not so obvious at the time. Big mouth and sharp teeth, this picture is more like a predator. If it is not the front paw and invisibility, I really don't tie the two together - I thought they were also some kind of mixed kind of evil beast. Come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s face can’t help but dignify a lot. “But it was discovered that those monsters belong to the heavens and the sea.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the threat that the evil beast can cause is limited, the Tianhai world is completely different. As participants in the battle of divineity, they can't breathe the devil in places where humans can't see them. The strength must not be underestimated. If the power of the Tianhai world appears in the West, this is definitely not good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the entire northern part of the fertile plains was encroached by the devil after the first battle of the gods. How did the Tianhai world infiltrate the hinterland of the mainland? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A horrified and exaggerated idea faintly into his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, when it comes to the evil beast... When the last time I entered the remains of the Snow Mountain, the First Army was attacked by the evil beast." The nightingale raised a brow, " To say that it is coincidental and too coincidentally, shouldn’t the evil beast and the Tianhai world be a group?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland and Isabella Qi Qi looked at the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter snorted. "I just talked about it, you don't have to worry about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "In short, this thing is probably more difficult than I expected." Roland tapped the desk. In any case, no winter city is the core of human industry, and no flashes are allowed. If the attack is related to the Tianhai world, no matter how prudent the countermeasures can be taken. "Isabella, the information you provided is very useful... Let's go to rest for a while, then I will let the head of the staff contact you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabella did not leave. "Your Majesty, I still have something to report to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Tell me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the period of Hermes, I did not stop experimenting with the stone." She took a stack of manuscript paper from the lining and placed it at the table. "You Remember the conclusion that Ai Gesha had before? It is not because the magic is too strong, which hinders the ability to perform, but because of other factors. I have repeatedly studied on this basis and found that this factor is likely to be related to frequency." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frequency?" Roland was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This statement does refer to the "Theory of Natural Science Theory" you wrote, which may not be accurate, but I really can't think of a better description. Isabella later narrated her findings in a concise and concise manner. "In fact... not long after I reached this conclusion, my magic has condensed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale blinked unexpectedly, and observed for a while "It's true... I didn't notice this before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland laughed. "Isn't that the league has an evolutionary one?" Witch? Congratulations, break through the self."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
