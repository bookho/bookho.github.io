			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Andrea asked, chewing the fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince of the Grey Fort is again tossing novelty, I saw him splicing a piece of copper pipe together, then let Anna melt the joint, and then let Roya wrapped a soft magical creation. At first glance, it looks like the water pipes installed in the bathroom, but the volume is much larger. Each one is close to the thickness of your thigh. If you don't rely on the weight of the hummingbird, one person can't move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the copper tube is more than one or two rooms, but runs through the entire castle and the witch building, both from the corner of the room, along the bottom of the wall I received a strange metal louver and then walked to the next room. At the end, it was connected to the longitudinal pipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vast project has attracted many witches to watch, whether it is the Sleeping Island or the Witch Alliance, they have shown great curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you guess?" He smiled mysteriously. "If you guessed it, add an ice cream bread for dinner."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia came to the mood, ice cream bread! That is the most amazing food here. Two pieces of roasted bread and tender tenderness are combined with a layer of sweet ice cream stuffing. I have never heard of it in the morning kingdom. When she first tasted, she immediately fell in love with this kind of food. Even though she was repeatedly laughed at by the ashes, she would have to blush to eat it. Otherwise, it would be a torment to look at the plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is to give water to the room?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still a short-sighted remark, Andrea pouted in his heart, copper is not a cheap metal, since the small pipes in the bathroom can deliver water, why Do it so big? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a recent rebuttal, I will be blocked by her "Who said that the food is the best and the best". Moreover, this is still premised on the face of Tilly's adult. It is really inconvenient to confess, and I have to say that I have not heard the superficial words of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The knowledge is short, and the water needs such a large pipeline," someone said behind him. "His Royal Highness will not do such a hard work." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ingenuity! Just like what I thought, Andreia’s spirit was strong, and she dared to speak to the extraordinary witch in this tone, in addition to herself, and the Miss Nightingale of the Witch Alliance. She turned her head back and saw that the other side looked disdainfully at the ashes, and the angle at which the chin was lifted was just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles should use this expression! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia secretly praised her, and when she came to Bianbu Town, her most affectionate witch was the woman who was a ghost. When the rescue of the ruins of the witches, the performances displayed by the nightingales are indeed extraordinary, and they are also a nobles, and even the hair color is very close! On the wall, several sniper battles against mixed species of evil beasts, the other side also recognized their ability, and shared the fish to themselves, quite aristocratic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that she is also very unwilling to see ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know how the ashes of the first time came to Bianzhen, how did he offend her, but... the enemy of the enemy is his own friend, isn’t it? What's more, her character and her own are so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems like you know the answer," Ashes shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly know," the nightingale curled up his mouth. "When I was drawing my design, I stayed in the office. I saw all the drawings he painted. In the eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not fair!" Mystery month muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“She doesn’t participate in the quiz,” the prince’s words made the night’s smug look a bit stiff. “Give you a hint that these pipes are just part of the system, so go Look elsewhere, it's easier to guess the answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Mai Hao immediately flew out of the room with lightning, and other witches were not far behind. Looking for the direction of the pipeline to go away. Andrea deliberately fell behind everyone, waiting for them to leave, only to make a look at the night, called her outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
