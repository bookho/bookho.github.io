			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You rarely say so much to a mortal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out of the cabin and lean on Betty, waiting in the aisle, followed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have more to say to Roland." Zoe did not think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we all know that he is not a real mortal." Betty pretended to be sorry. "Shawn Mingming only wants you to talk about the origin of the church." After all, the punishment of the witch itself is more persuasive. Look at what you said, "That is not worth it", "It was a mistake from the beginning" - hey, she is still a wound, you are not afraid She didn't come back in one breath, was she killed by alive? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our mission is to recycle the ancient treasures, and to rescue the captured believers, as to whether she is dead or alive, what does it matter to me?" Zoe stopped and looked back at Betty. "I said you... When did you care about a mortal?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't people and people care about each other before?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whoever is possible, you are unlikely to say such things," Zoe paused. "Wait... you are just schadenfre." ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say it," Betty laughed. "Because I thought about going with you--"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough," Zoe sighed. "She does look a lot." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s just a mold. Betty walked over to Zoe and leaned over to the porthole. "If she was born for four hundred years... If she was also a witch, then at the final meeting of the federation..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She will definitely choose to follow Master Akaris, not us. Zoe said, "It is because of this that it is even more irritating." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina is not someone but a group of people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of good It is easy to survive, and there is a gray union federation witch.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choices placed before them are running out.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eveningly, most of them did not give up hope, compared with the clueless "celebral", the godly witch plan that relies on its own strength to achieve the goal step by step has won more support. Even if it sacrificed, it would be the Federation itself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the meeting that decided the fate, Akaris completely overwhelmed Nataya, "Humans do not The cry of extermination and witches forever has almost become the only voice on the scene. In fact, even many followers of Nataya are hesitant. I don’t know if this road can see the dawn. She can only stand. On the side, I was anxious for the Queen of the Day, and I couldn’t even insert a sentence.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude towards Farina is just a move It’s not a church believer, but a former federation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to tell them that a weak witch is not an opportunity to turn over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to tell them that ignorant short-sighted mortals are not useless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what she wants to say the most is, wait a second...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t pull out because of differences The sword is facing each other.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end all these thoughts have turned into a sigh.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not With decisive evidence, even if you come back again, the three seats will surely follow the same path.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gloomy moment of crumbling, only the heart is like steel, In order to guide everyone to move forward.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Akaris, Eleanor and Nataya can see how good this is now... ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side of the room, Kajin dropped the pen in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, this..." Roentgen was equally shocked. Obviously, I didn't expect to hear such a subversive dialogue. "We won't know too much." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to better understand the story between Joe and Farina, Sean specially prepared a room next to the ward for the two. The study room, and also the hands and feet on the partition wall - a glass mirror that looks like a plain, decorative, but has a one-way light transmission ability, you can see through the "wall hole" of a few inches square Clear the situation of the entire room. In addition, two megaphones are connected to the corners, and the opposite side of the ear can clearly capture the opposite conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This observation experience similar to peep is also the first time for Kajin Fez, although he knows that this is not appropriate, but still Can resist the temptation - what more realistic drama than this? The people in the room are like actors, performing a drama called reality, and he is the audience and the recorder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it was a story about love and redemption, but I heard the past that the church did not know. This news is really shocking for both people. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inheritance of the four kingdoms comes from the witch empire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the church was created by the Witch Federation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient witches even have the means to occupy the body of ordinary people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which news is sent out, it can make a shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renchen looked out of the door uneasily, as if a guard would rush in at any time, put her into a linen bag, and then throw it into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words in the mind of Ronaldinho have emerged from the words of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It reflects the flower of love that was born in the darkest ages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you should understand the meaning of the adaptation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe...has you expected this all? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what, he has been unable to withdraw from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even if he does, he will not opt ​​out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cardin’s heart has a hunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This drama will be an unprecedented milestone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the two people across the mirror seem to have new actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly picked up the megaphone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ultimately...has become like this..." Farina The eyes seem to have lost their focal length, looking at Joe clearly, but their eyes are like penetrating him, falling in the distance of nothing. "The church is gone... no one will need me anymore... you saved me, I can't give you any return...I'm sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice is getting lower and lower, as if she might leave at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe grabbed her hand, "I saved you for what church!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; His voice is so big that Farina can't help but be one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't have any hope for the church from the beginning, but I wanted to mix the days! It was very pious in front of everyone, it was because of the promotion. It’s quite smooth! I used to be a nobleman, how can I dedicate everything to the gods?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You--” Farina bit her lip and re-in her pupil The focus, she lifted her hand with difficulty, seems to want to fan the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
