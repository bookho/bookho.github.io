			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle hall of the morning king is much larger than the winter city, even if it is a hundred people, it is not crowded. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long list of participants, divided into two distinct parties, one is the high-level gray-headed high-class, and the other is the morning grand aristocrat and the chamber of commerce. Compared with the former, who is calm and waiting for the start of the meeting, the latter is obviously somewhat restless. Many people are anxious, and they whisper each other from time to time. The whisper is not interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the appearance of the god of God made a great impact on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the fear cannot be prevented, the order of neighboring countries may collapse at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows that he must stabilize the confidence of his allies before then. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the report of the Executive Office, since Hoofd became the new dawn, the trade on both sides has climbed to new heights, and now it is transported into the iron without winter city. Nearly 20% of metal raw materials and crude products such as copper and aluminum come from neighboring countries. Leather, fabric, cured meat, cheese and other living materials account for more than half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has made a lot of efforts in this regard, without the support of Chenxi, no winter still maintains the people in the case of abnormal population growth. The steady growth of living water is almost impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this alone, he cannot simply abandon the morning kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, there is also the impeccable Quinn family during the alliance - Roland doesn't know if there will be next support after Hoofd Quinn However, there is basically no longer a bond like Andrea Quinn that perfectly connects the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quietly looked at every aristocrat on the left hand until their whispers gradually subsided, he said, "I have been reporting since the outbreak of the war. I heard about your contribution, so I’ll say it here first, everyone is working hard.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of everyone can’t help but show a surprised look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for Roland, this is not a false statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army alone is obviously not likely to make the north and south aorta run so fast, and many carriages and porters on the road play a vital role. In this era, most of the aristocratic expeditions are a wave of habits, and it is customary to use looting instead of replenishment. Therefore, few people can understand the great significance of logistics and it is difficult to realize their contribution to the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About the battle of God, I think everyone knows very well - as I have repeatedly stressed, the losing party will be completely extinct, there is no possibility of surrender Therefore, there is no second way to go except for confrontation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As early as four or five years ago, I was preparing for this war. However, the human kingdom is not only a gray castle. It needs every living person to participate in it. Only in this way can we win the battle of destiny. I am very happy to see that you have become a part of the resistance army." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded to Barov, who opened a thick notepad and read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is part of the logistic record of the First Army, and the contribution of the mornings in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not intend to use sensational methods to persuade these nobles, what to defend the country, to sacrifice for humanity, and to think about it. They produce any touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most straightforward is still the benefits and pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the more precise the description, the more convincing it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first wants these nobles to understand that even if they don’t have to go to the front, they can make a very important contribution to the war; secondly, these achievements will be in black and white. The form is recorded and the corresponding compensation can be exchanged after the war. In the end, all the aristocrats who are passively resisting war or who are betraying humanity will be severely punished. At this critical moment, Roland has no energy to let them choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main and the vivid, the content is detailed, the king of the gray castle can be said to have grasped the focus from the beginning. Pulling aristocrats who are not part of the military into this event, which will surely be recorded in history and passed down for thousands of years, will undoubtedly increase their sense of participation. It is important to know that linking family history to history is also one of the goals pursued by the nobility. Moreover, under the other party's explanation, the risks and incomes do not seem to be very different, at least not treated as abandonment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distribution of benefits is always a difficult problem to test the superiors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several family members have proposed to him more than once, there is no need to do this to Roland Wimbledon’s instructions, it should behave more like the dawn of the king. He always smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the Grey Fort, which makes artillery, biplanes, and steel ships, is worthy of admiration, but that is not the whole reason why he values ​​the other side. The family is really The benefits obtained are the basis for his determination to be loyal. In the trade between Chenxi and Gray Fort, the other party did not rely on the strong strength and daughter Andrea's relationship to take advantage of it. On the contrary, every business was paid according to the fact. Sometimes, even a part of the profits will be given, so that everyone involved can get a lot of benefits, which is more important than the strength itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia should have seen this point before he suggested it to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other son, Horn, is far worse than the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland, but the premise of all that you said is that human beings can win the final victory." When Barov finished his explanation, someone got up and asked, "The question is, can Grey Fort really win the devil? I heard..." He hesitated. "Your army seems to have been defeated in the wolf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes... we all know the strength of the First Army," the other person said with concern. "But the floating land is too terrible... once it is over, we simply run away. It’s too late.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took the teacup and slowly took a sip of black tea. He knew that the result of the battle of the desperate mountains would sooner or later spread out. Among the follow-up search and rescue personnel, there are also many wolves who are familiar with the terrain. In this sniper war, there were more than a thousand soldiers who lost their links before and after. Not only the artillery units, but even the reserve team responsible for the response suffered heavy losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Air Knight lost more than forty aircraft in a series of high-intensity support battles for several days, half of which were shot down by the enemy and half destroyed by mechanical failures and accidents. This is why Tilly had to suspend her actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the seagull was hit by the gods, but both Wendy and Sawyer are the masters of the field, plus lightning and wheat He kept staying close, and soon saved all the witches on the plane after the forced landing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, when Roland saw these reports for the first time, his heart was hung in the eyes of the blind. From the number of troops lost, this was the biggest casualty. Battle. However, he also agrees with the practice of the staff--Wakiris only knows the principle of God-made gods, but he does not know the details of the symbiosis. If he does not play, he will never be able to find out the details of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This failure was due to our lack of understanding of the floating land," Roland replied frankly. "It looks huge and impeccable, but it is not. Itis, then you will explain it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Northland Pearl nailed the detailed hand drawing of the god of God to the wall In detail, "According to the observations of the First Army, it is roughly circular and has a diameter of 50 to 60 kilometers, which is equivalent to the desolate mountains. The upper part and the vertebral part can emit giant stone spears with a range of at least It is more than fifteen kilometers. This is the key weapon that caused the first army to be caught off guard, but it also means that once it leaves this distance, it is just a floating island floating in the sky. We can use this to make plans. , tempering opponents..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear is always born with the unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People will be afraid of emotional experiences and portrayal, but will not be afraid of a bunch of numbers. Instead of trying to cover up the failures, or using hollow words to deceive everyone, it is better to expose the information that the First Army paid a great price to expose the participants to fear from a rational level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Above, this is all the details of the devil's floating land." Itis swayed to Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
