			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put down the report and couldn’t help but think of the information revealed by Cabrador. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy from the heavens and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it really because there is too much pressure on the devil over there, causing them to be unable to take care of the war in the fertile plains? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff is increasingly inclined to this judgment, after all, no matter what kind of tricks are secretly planned, the final decision of the situation is hard power. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Devils rushed to the forest terminal, but they were caught off guard by the leaves, but they also exposed their abilities and whereabouts - even in the scope of the magic eye detection. In addition, its magical atmosphere is still eye-catching for Hilly. Now the flashing "red star" is residing in the ruins of the ruins. Once there is any change, Sylvie will be able to perceive it for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, the devil who has encroached on Takira has already done the cards, and no winter city is still adding new chips. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ample money and food, the Executive Office launched a new round of expansion, and this time the scope of recruitment has expanded to the whole country - after the gray fort is administratively unified, The mobilization ability has been significantly improved. According to Barov’s preliminary estimate, the number of troops provided by each place is likely to exceed 5,000, which is equivalent to the total number of First Army two years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northland, which is managed by Calvin Kant, is the most active. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the officials of the secondary city hall are mature and able to fully control the territory, the number of recruits will undoubtedly be repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weapons, the work of bolting rifles instead of runner rifles is proceeding in an orderly manner. Thanks to the rapid growth of skilled workers and the improvement of craftsmanship, the large-scale rifle and the precision shooter team's weapons are almost the same - except for the lack of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revolver rifle, despite its fast rate of fire, has its own structure that determines its low initial velocity, short range, and poor precision. It is more than enough for the aristocratic knight, but with throwing distance. In the same battle between the one hundred and two hundred meters, it seems to be a little short. The bolting rifle can effectively make up for this deficiency and regain the advantage of the distance for the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-devil grenade developed for the high-end devil and spider magic has also been finalized and entered the mass production phase. Such a simple structure and cheap materials do not have any technical obstacles. In a sense, it is even simpler than manufacturing bullets. According to the current production schedule, it can fully catch up with the decisive battle one month later. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the first army lacks relevant training, the ease of operation itself is a major feature of individual grenade, which is fundamentally different from artillery. In history, this kind of weapon was also directly put into actual combat and trained and tested on the battlefield. Therefore, Roland is not worried about this issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no change in the devil who is entrenched in Tacula. Aegis and Felice judged according to the amount of red line traffic. The number of enemies should be Between 3,000 and 5,000, for the federation four hundred years ago, it may be enough to claim a big battle, but if it is replaced by the first army, this part of the devil has fallen into a disadvantage in terms of number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the enemy needs red fog to sustain life, the iron is difficult to hide or deceive on the hard power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the most important basis for the staff to make judgments. To be honest, Roland also felt that the judgment was credible - the evidence on the battlefield was evidence, and there was no difference in imagining the enemy as being too weak and too strong. The only thing he can do is to not hesitate to direct the war to the more professional people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably I am not a mastermind, I will be worried, he thinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t see any problems, don’t guess, just wait until the day of the final battle, and everything will be revealed. Roland grew a sigh of relief and was preparing to lick some of his painful foreheads. One hand had already pressed on his temple, and the strength was not too light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
