			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer is coming in a heavy rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dense rain falls on the glass window, making a squeaking sound, the scenery outside the window becomes blurred, and the town and the distance can only be distinguished by the outline of the color. The mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking at the city under the rain curtain, and the song of "City of Love" was still floating in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t expect the effect of the drama premiere three days ago with the ability to echo, the effect would be so amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the show ended, the audience was silent, and the audience was in tears. Roland thought that such a scene would only appear in the later opera houses. Even a little grassy cinema will not have such an effect, let alone a group of ordinary people in a backward era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with all the tears of the bombardment, he felt the tremor from the bottom of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power of the "Resonance Song." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland certainly knows what it means to be inspiring. In a protracted war, the machine will not be exhausted, but people will. Even if guns and ammunition can be transported to the battlefield, people will be overwhelmed by the inexhaustible pressure of survival. Especially when the situation is unfavorable and the casualties are heavy, this kind of emotion is extremely easy to enlarge infinitely, and eventually the army loses the fighting spirit to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History has come up with many ways to improve the morale of the team, such as letting soldiers eat hot food, air ice cream, political commissars and priests, etc. However, these requirements are too high for Roland. The former is very testing the logistical replenishment ability, while the latter is difficult to cultivate a group of backbone elements with a firm belief and good at instigating others in a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to echo allows him to see a quick way to improve momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is somewhat absurd, it is indeed more reliable to develop into an idol than other methods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was thinking that the door of the office was suddenly ringing and Barov came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, the recent purchase statistics have come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the result?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you might expect," he excitedly spread a list on the mahogany table. "After the new drama, go to the City Hall to apply for a loan, purchase The number of people in the housing has increased significantly, and even the registration of marriage has risen a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Roland returned to the table to check Barov Statistics. "City of Love" is not an unadorned entertainment. Apart from promoting the glory of work and building greatness, it contains another point of view that hangs on marriage and a stable home. Instead of letting outsiders slowly create a sense of belonging, and let local people accept these foreign visitors a little through daily contact, it is better for him to divide a simple standard to promote the integration of the local people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This standard is the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a house, it's your own person" - it looks very rude, but it saves a lot of running-in time in an extraordinary period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to get people's approval and want to harvest your family, you have to have a place to live. Once the outsiders have a constant birth, they will consciously maintain everything in the area. Of course, these concepts are not very suitable for straightforward speaking, and they can be more deeply rooted in the drama through the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a diamond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A classic essay that has been circulated to the king of gems, the position necessary for marriage, completely neglects that it is neither rare nor The essence of not expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house has at least a high practical value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, the goal can't be set too far away, making people feel out of reach. A Golden Dragon can apply for a rental house, and only need to pay one Golden Dragon a year as a rent. When the rent is paid equal to the price of the house, the house is automatically owned by the renter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
