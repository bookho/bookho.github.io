			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Ryan came out of Earl’s House, he involuntarily raised his eyes and took a deep breath. At half a month, he finally felt the taste of daylight and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warcome can be seen everywhere wearing uniform uniforms, they did not swarm into the house to search, but in an orderly way at various intersections. Occasionally, I saw streaks of blood in the snow, but I couldn’t find a body. I didn’t see the messy clothes and fabrics on the ground—meaning that they didn’t plunder the dead when they cleaned up the battlefield... Rennes confirmed again. My own thoughts, this team is different from any team he has ever seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People is okay?" He looked at the iron axe around him, "Long Song Fortress... How?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything is fine," the physique of the peasant is very few, and the answer is very simple, but as long as you ask yourself, you can always get a reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is good, it means that Jacques Meade’s plan is not successful, he is relieved a little, if the fortress is not damaged, the honeysuckle family is not damaged, Pei Luo should say two good words for himself. As for Jacques's end, he was too lazy to think about it. A fool who almost dragged the elk into the abyss had nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother... Jacques what did he do?" Orilyan replied in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated and finally shook his head. "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other Suddenly revealed a "you are lying to me" expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan smiled a bit, he really didn’t know how to answer this question... If Jacques tried to rebel, it’s just a planning stage when he heard it. In the end, he did not know what he was doing. After a moment of silence, he began. "Do you really want to go to the castle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course. I am also very curious about what happened. These people dared to break into the Earl's House during the day," she said, and she took a look at the iron axe. "Peo is not going to sit back and watch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rennes knew that Sanmei was actually worried about each other and eventually nodded. "Alright, if you ask him, he should tell you the details."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The group rode along the avenue covered by snow for about half an hour and arrived at the fortress castle at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the leadership of the Iron Axe, Ryan’s brother and sister climbed to the third floor, where the defense was more rigorous, and there was an alert guard at almost every few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering a room like a study, he finally saw Pedro Hermon, the childhood friend. But the other side just stood respectfully, and there was a gray-haired man sitting in front of the desk. He was playing with the quill in his hand and looked at himself and Aurelian with great interest. Almost a moment, Rennes recalled the identity of this person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately squatted on one knee, "Respected His Royal Highness, Rennes Vader pays tribute to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is..." Orilyan was a little surprised, but after Rennes's swaying, she bent her knees and bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have met at the Long Song Fortress," the prince smiled. "It’s in the basement of the castle. I just heard the iron axe report, this time. Are you locked up again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Ryan groaned and didn't know how to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, my Royal Highness did not really want to hear the answer, "Get up. Before I ordered the attack on the Elk family territory, Pero assured me again, saying that you Absolutely not involved in the rebellion planned by Jacques Meade, it seems that he did not guess wrong. But... How did you get stuck?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray I gratefully looked at Perot and then told all about what happened in the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out," the prince nodded. "It's a pity. If you can stop the Earl of Elk, the long song fortress will not be robbed."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
