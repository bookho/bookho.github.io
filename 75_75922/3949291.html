			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prius has been here for five days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not a cell, the converted homes and cells are almost the same - the original wooden doors were replaced with wooden railings, and the furniture in the house was all removed. Only a few blankets are left. The only advantage is that the room is still clean, neither air nor rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to him, there are four people in prison. Three of them came from the Len family, one belonging to the rushing wolf family, and himself, the knight of the elk deer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell, what time does he want to shut us down?" Ryan’s family looks like one of the oldest knights, "The wheat field in the territory is still I haven't planted it! My mother-in-law doesn't know how to make these things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your territory?" The young knight of the rushing wolf smirked, "You think the prince of the prince." Will you still have a knight collar, let you go back to the horses, weapons and armor, and then wait for an opportunity to take revenge? Seriously, he did not send you all to the gallows, it is considered merciful."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say!?" The old knight stared at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To tell the truth," the young knight is full of disregard, "the duke is the number one prisoner who planned and implemented the rebellion, not cleaning up his elite knights, waiting Leave it to his son? As for us, it is naturally forced by the Duke to fight on the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I see you are dead!" He walked over and mentioned the young man, his right hand clenched his fist, and as he watched it go down, a hand came out from behind and grabbed him firmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop, Halong. Do you want to attract guards?" A handsome knight who pressed his fist down. "He is right, We are the knights of the Duke's majesty, and will certainly be severely sentenced when convicted. Since this step is taken, wait for the result quietly. Look at the people of the elk family and look at your present appearance. Are you a nobleman? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prius recognizes him, the star knight of the long song fortress, Phil Sylt, nicknamed dawn dawn, has lost many unknown ladies. . He was good, and in the end he married a civilian woman. This incident was also aroused at the time. Seeing the other person mentioning himself, Prius is also not good enough to keep silent. He said to the three people in dispute: "I don't know if the territory can leave me, but the Prince will not at least kill you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least in the fortress, it can also be a shocking effect, and it will work hard for you. Get here, who to kill? His people?” Prius shook his head. “The Knights have not stepped into the side of the town.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Without rushing in to kill and rob, the townspeople will naturally not have extreme hatred. Therefore, for the prince, killing the townspeople is not as good as killing the fortress nobles. If they are not killed in the fortress, their lives will be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill thought for a moment and nodded. "It makes sense. What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Prius Diza."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your relief, Sir Desa." Film voted with gratitude, pulling Long sat back to the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man also sat down and sang against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really not afraid, Prius thinks, and his own "calm" is just an illusion of forced out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pris knew clearly that he was not a knight. He did not inherit the bravery of his father, nor did he inherit the wisdom of his mother. He preferred to take care of his one-acre three-pointer than the sword. Raise chickens and ducks and fish for fishing at the pond. The armored sword is the helpless for the Earl of Elk, not to mention killing, he does not even love to participate in hunting. Therefore, when the assault, Prius rushed as far as possible, but did not expect to return a life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait...He suddenly felt a bit strange when he thought of it. As a star knight under the Duke, why did the film Silt survive? Shouldn't he be in the first place? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
