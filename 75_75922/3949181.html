			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland got up in the morning, it wasn’t Tyre who was waiting for him, but an older maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the bedroom, the chief knight Carter is waiting for him outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I have to tell you an unfortunate news," he said, "Your maid was dead last night."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Roland's eyelids jumped, and although I knew this result, I still felt a little uncomfortable. After all, this person died because of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She fell from the balcony of the room, there was no trace of fighting at the scene, and the guard did not see the outsiders coming in and out. So...should she accidentally fall, this It was an accident."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers reported on the results of the investigation, while looking at Roland's eyes was a bit weird. Roland certainly knows what he is thinking. When he was in the Grey Fort, the Four Princes wanted to occupy Tyre many times. In this era, it is normal for the prince to have a relationship with the maids around him. There are few recreational activities, and there is almost no nightlife. If you have enough to eat, you will naturally think about making people. Not only do you make it yourself, but the prince and the upper aristocrats will exchange women and even gather together to create a party, so the chaos of the noble circle is not a simple ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four princes have been more convergent in this convenience. After switching to Roland, even the women have not touched it - except for Tyre, the other maids The level can be described as chilling. In addition, after crossing, I have to face the demon moon. His brain is almost completely filled with farming plans, and it is too late to enjoy the aristocratic life of the wind and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a pity," Roland pretended to be a pity. "The future of Tyre was handed over to the older maid who was waiting for me this morning." Let's do it. She is the new maid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The card features nodded and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland just stepped into the office and saw the nightingale sitting on the red wooden table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you ask?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing, when she saw me I committed suicide," she said with a bit of frustration. "It's too fast, and there is no hesitation at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't actually control her?" Roland Pass each other and sit back on the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I tied her up," the nightingale leaned back and leaned over. "Who thought she had poison in her teeth. I had to fake an accident." Fall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you were experienced, so it’s so kind to collect the reward?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, don't say that, although I didn't ask anything from her mouth, it doesn't mean that I have nothing to gain," the nightingale chuckled twice and put a folded piece of paper in front of Roland. "Searched from her room." ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland spreads the paper, it is a family book, the sender said that Tyre is the sister, the content is just ordinary chat. However, he noticed that the other side mentioned the sea many times, such as the beautiful scenery of the seaside, she likes to stay on the beach to watch the sunset. When the letter finally asked her sister to come back, she missed her sister very much. Reminiscent of the territory of several brothers and sisters, Roland is uncertain, "Three Kings of the Clear Water Harbor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably this is the case, your two My brother can't see the sea. According to my speculation, the three-way woman, Garcia Wimbledon, held her sister hostage and used her as a hidden piece. From the decisive style of her suicide, it is unlikely that it will be arranged at random. That is to say, she has been trained for at least two to three years before being placed next to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sighed softly and sighed It won't be so easy to end. Even if he does not fight, it does not mean to stay out of it. For the throne, his brothers and sisters have no concerns at all, and similar things may happen again in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, someone is coming. I will leave, my Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night 莺The ground blew the air out of Roland, and then disappeared in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it wasn’t the first time I saw it, it was a shock to Roland’s play during the day. He hesitated, and tried to reach out to the empty table, and when he reached halfway, he was intercepted by a soft hand. "His Royal Highness, you can make Anna sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
