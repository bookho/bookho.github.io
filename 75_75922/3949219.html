			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Broadcast] Pay attention to the "starting point reading", get the first hand news of 515 red packets, and the students who have not robbed the red envelope after the Chinese New Year, this time you can show your skills. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second recruitment of Bentham Town is much smoother than the first time, thanks to the winter food distribution, the militia team can get more and better food. Every week on the family day, there are many players who secretly hand over the bread and dried meat that they have saved on weekdays to their loved ones. Roland told Carter and the Iron Axe not to interfere with the matter, and the loved ones happily brought the food back home and spread the news to the neighbors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A force composed of people is an excellent publicity model in itself. It is much more effective to talk to neighbors than to deliberately promote the city hall. Most people in the old town now know this – the militia team formed by His Royal Highness is not only well-paid, but also eats three meals a day. The battle with the evil beast does not seem so dangerous. Therefore, when recruiting troops for the second time, the number of people in the old districts has greatly increased, and even residents of the new districts have come to register. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people who met the requirements was much higher than Roland’s expectations, so the second militia team enrolled 200 people and was trained by Carter on weekdays. When the horn blew, they went to the city wall and stood by as an auxiliary force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Cavalier and the Assistant Minister have raised objections to this. At present, the first militia team is capable of fighting the evil beast. It is unnecessary to have a team and more than twice the number of the first team. Food and salary that are higher than the average person's ration will lead to aggravation of the financial expenditure burden, and this more expensive Jinlong will not play a significant role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland insisted on his decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these people are not prepared to deal with evil beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still afraid to inform his men about his plans in his mind. Before the Duke did not start, he had the intention of attacking the fortress - this idea is now said to go out, Carter and Barov are only completely unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long song fortress is different from the border town. As the official border of the Grey Fort Kingdom, its walls are ten meters high and are accumulated by bricks and stones. . The Duke and the Six People in the West are stationed in the inner city, and the number of adjustable soldiers is estimated to be around 1,000. In theory, it is impossible for the militia team, which is less than 300 people, to win the fortress in the siege warfare - even if it is equipped with firearms across the ages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And because of the existence of the stone of the gods, the witch can not be used as a dagger weapon, this Roland has repeatedly confirmed to the nightingale. For example, the nobles of the Duke of Ryan and the six of them will certainly spare no effort in purchasing the stone of God's punishment - of course, the saying to the outside world is called donation. This kind of stone that can be exchanged for dozens of golden dragons can be banned from witches within a certain range. It is the most powerful weapon for the church to declare against the devil, and it is also their biggest entry every year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s only chance is in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time, the war between the lords is mostly a mode of calling. The men who want to convene will not be able to sneak in the middle of the journey, and the lord will basically go with the team, which gives Roland the opportunity to annihilate the battle. But how to grasp this opportunity, he is still unable to do anything. After all, his experience of enticing the enemy is all from film and television works or historical stories, and has never actually been manipulated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t understand, you should do it yourself first, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stretched out, walked out of the office, and went to the backyard wooden shed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assembled steam No.2 is quietly standing in the center of the field. At first glance, its appearance is much cleaner than that of the steamer, and the traces of the welds of large parts are no longer as uneven as before. This is a masterpiece of Anna's new ability. Her green fire can be drilled into small gaps for welding, and the large pieces that are pieced together are better than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the follow-up model, it is stronger than the original model. The magic model is stronger than the follow-up model. The steam No. 2 machine has been equipped with a centrifugal governor. As the first automatic control system and feedback system in human history, its appearance can be called extraordinary. The structure of the governor is very simple. The main body consists of two hinged thin rods welded to the iron ball and a rotating main rod. At first glance, it is like a bamboo pole that is often played as a child. As soon as the bamboo poles are quickly moved, the two rotating blades will automatically rise due to the centrifugal force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
