			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She, she woke up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zou heard a surprise Huh, followed by a few bright swords suddenly placed on her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't shake!" Aer's voice also appeared in his mind. "Before we confirm who you are, it's good to keep your current position." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that...she noticed that her hands and feet were tied by iron locks, lying on the stone bed where the devil was originally, and standing around A circle of vigilant partners. This is indeed a decisive decision. It is necessary to ban the shackles before she or she has yet to distinguish between the gods and the devils. The first sentence is not to ask who you are, but to put the responsibility of judgment on one's own side. It also illustrates the maturity of the clerk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, after the devil occupies her body, any answer may be a lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Cabrada is not swearing, the dozens of days spent in the darkness of consciousness are estimated to be only a few minutes in reality. Being able to make correct judgments and take countermeasures in such a short period of time is in all likelihood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a partner, she really has nothing to worry about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Zoe intended to close his eyes and give the rest of the work to everyone, the scene in the seams made her frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a stone bed under the core of the magic, although I can’t see who is lying on it, but from the witch standing next to me, the answer is almost it goes without saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly thought of a possibility -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they plan to use the dream world of Roland? To confirm identity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no one here can refer to Roland, if this happens, then it may only be the other party’s initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... this is too inappropriate! How did Elsie agree to the program? Isn't she clear about the meaning of the mortal king to the punishment of witches! Moreover, it can be known from the words of the devil that their understanding of the magic is far stronger than the witch. If the dream world is also constructed by magic, it is really adventurous to put any high-level enemy into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a white boast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Zoe can no longer hold back the silence, "Wait, don't open the dream, I am Zoe!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aer gave her a look and ignored it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Listen, Kabradabi can tamper with the magic effect to a certain extent. If you let it enter the dream, you may be surprised by what happens. Wake up, hurry up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Is it... Honestly, lying on the slate is so icy, if you don't put it on Layer quilt, I really can't fall asleep. But if you are a devil, you can say that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a familiar sound on her head. sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zou tried to raise his neck and look to the rear, and then a gray-haired man came into her eyes - it was Roland Wimbledon, The mortal king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that he has not yet lie down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, this unconscious emptiness body feels a bit warm and full, just as the body is no longer empty, but more Something that can't be said - compared to reminding her why the real pain, this very different feelings also make her feel calm and satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
