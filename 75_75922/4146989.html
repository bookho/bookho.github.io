			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for choosing the mystery month is very simple. Compared to the summoning ability, the enchanting ability is more suitable for the magic core to play a role - such as Anna's black fire, even if it has The corresponding core cyclone can't be sent and received like Anna himself. The latter is less troublesome, just need to inject magic and activate the instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the biggest improvement in the absence of winter city with "magnetizing ability". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twilight No.1 has always been a shortage of resources, even with Doris’s “magicization” assistance, it can only be said to be barely enough. . If the scale of the factory is to be expanded in the future, the power supply will immediately become in a state of being stretched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The partial power generation and power transmission and transformation is an extremely complicated and huge subject, completely no less than the mechanical profession, using the knowledge of middle school to engage in motor and light bulbs. It is a bit difficult for Roland to create a reliable power grid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he also moved a lot of textbooks about electricity from the dream world, but found that he couldn’t keep going, and the content inside could even use "every word." I know each other, and I don’t even know what it means to be together. Instead of starting from scratch, it is better to put hope on the Taqila witches - perhaps after another ten or twenty years, they will be able to shine in various industries, but now there is no winter city to fill this piece is basically not expected It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it is particularly important to expand the production of Dawning One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The factory can produce electricity overnight, and there is electricity in the residential area to work during the day and study at night. In a sense, the power system is also a time. Installed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin said that this is technically uncomfortable. The original carrier has far more magical awareness than humans. The average witch can only determine the observer by using the balance magic stone. The type and level of magic, but in her mind, can form the structure of the cyclone, as long as the mystery month in front of her face more than a few times ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when the mystery month was notified, the little girl rarely expressed a sense of resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whispered, "If the magic core can replace me... then will you not want me?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of Roland’s shackles, she promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the core of imitating the ability to change magnetism is also named after her, the mystery instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the other party’s statement: "This way, even if you don't want me, you will remember the name... In addition, in order to compensate my frustrated heart, I can send two more bottles. Chaos drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she was dragged down by Lily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes several days to adjust the magic core, and designing a DC grid throughout the city is the same - although it only uses the most basic series, Parallel knowledge, and as much as possible to introduce more light power to simplify the calculation, still counted Roland exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And during this period, no winter city came a group of unexpected visitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex took a dozen members of the Wonder Club and submitted a paperwork to the King of Graysburg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland soon saw this group of alternative explorers from the fjord in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you wouldn't come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the attendant to serve tea dessert After a slow statement, said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Fjord and the Shamin left the No Winter City, it has been more than three months since then. If it were not in the extreme south, there were piles of relics coming in, He almost forgot about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While speaking, Roland is also looking at this group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably because of the cross-sea trek, everyone looks a bit embarrassed. It seems that in the fjord, only those who can’t get the boat completely can choose another path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
