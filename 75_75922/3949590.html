			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the north slope of the backyard facing the whistling north wind and drifting snow, Lucia closed the wooden door and blocked the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the winter, a wooden shed was set up above the yard. Although it affects the lighting, it can at least avoid the snow from burying it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burning bonfire on the side of the yard, and the heat waves from the flames could be felt at the door. Lucia took off her gloves and put the cold hands against the bonfire. Its temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cold?" Anna, standing in front of the workbench, turned her head. "Come here, I will warm you up."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...thank you," Lucia ran to her side, then her body was surrounded by a warm green fire, like a soak in the castle's bath, feeling from head to toe. It is comfortable and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really convenient... Lucia’s envious thoughts, she never has to fear the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Warm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm!" She nodded hard. "You are What to make?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, some new gun parts,” Anna picked up a slender steel tube with a piston in the middle and pulled it back and forth twice. "His Highness said that he did not have a successful grasp and needs to be tested repeatedly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of these parts is bright and smooth, obviously using the best steel And carefully cut through black fire. Before coming to the town, Lucia wouldn't have thought that the iron surface could be made as smooth as glass, just like a piece of art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these works of art also have their own merits, and she can’t help but raise her lips when she thinks of it. His Royal Highness Roland and Anna have said that there is no high quality. The material, even if the processing method is accurate, the finished product will only be a thousand holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you come with you?" Anna took back the green fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said that there are still some things to deal with, and will come later, let me first familiarize myself with the new ability," Lucia grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ability of your evolution...what is it?" she asked with great interest. "The Witch Alliance estimates that no one can compare with adulthood." You are even more sensational."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia was embarrassed to touch his head. "I would not have been able to support you without Supper." The last moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have already said thank you, don't keep this matter in your heart," Anna waved her hand. "Come on your new The ability to take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia responded and began to drive the magic of the body, the strange feeling that night again came to my heart - the outline of everything became No longer familiar and continuous, but differentiate into many tiny squares that are gathered together in color to form a patch of color. Only this time, she didn't feel the cramps of the magic again, so she could calm down and look at each square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up a piece of Anna's finished part, and the smooth gray-white surface had become bumpy. Under the magical surround, the color spots on the top were clearly visible. - There are about seven or eight colors, the largest of which is cyan. Their arrangement is completely irregular, as if the painter accidentally knocked a pile of paint in the bowl on the ground. The only difference is that they have distinct boundaries and do not encroach on each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the tiny particles that His Highness said, Lucia realized that if it is the foundation that makes up everything, these "squares" and "spots" are too big. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is a larger classification on the particle, that is the element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particles are combined into larger balls according to different rules. These balls react differently due to their different structures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she is still ignorant of her abilities at Jin Suicheng and does not understand its specific role, she is now able to clearly understand the concept of elements. According to His Royal Highness's description and classification of them, what they have observed should be these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
