			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The detective team brought the news back to No Winter City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a nesting..." After listening to the lightning report, Roland grew a sigh of relief. This will undoubtedly be the first frontal collision between the two communities, and it is probably the last time. Regardless of the outcome, it will determine the future fate of mankind and the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We...can you win?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning hesitated and asked. She was visibly dirty, and the hair on her forehead was consolidated into a bundle. When she was close, there would be a sour smell. Obviously, in order to inform him of the results as soon as possible, she would have barely rested in these days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Roland pretended to pat the other's shoulders easily. "We don't just have to win, we have to win cleanliness."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil has an undisputed advantage in quantity, and it can be seen how much pressure the Tianhai world has given them. The first army has an advantage in technology, but it can't be harmless. After letting them enter the four kingdoms, it is a victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the same token, even if the devil can win, it will inevitably be a heavy loss. So if you don't block them west of the desolate mountains, the best result is nothing but damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning was slightly relieved, and then suddenly I was a little embarrassed, "Hey, am I smelling a bit...blame?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is dumbfounded. "There is a little bit...but this is the taste of adventure, so there is nothing wrong with it." He deliberately took a nose. "To be honest, I feel pretty good." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person’s face suddenly became red. She grabbed the stubble that sniffed her collar and walked down the office. "I, I Take a shower in the bathroom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕?" McMug is still a look of awkwardness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning, McMug." When the two were about to leave, Roland stopped them and said slowly, "Work hard, then take a rest." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door was closed, he immediately grabbed it. The telephone number of the Executive Director of the Executive Office, "Notify all ministers to meet, the time has come for the departure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the conference hall, there is no lap in the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland puts a hand-painted figure of lightning on the map behind him, and then repeats all the discoveries of the expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is two points that can be confirmed now. One is that the new god of God does exist. It is less than three hundred kilometers from the mainland spine and is constantly Moving eastward. Second, it carries a large number of devils, and even more than the floating land can not accommodate, so it will be transferred in this inefficient way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The former I think is not difficult to understand, in order to invade the winter and the wolf heart, the Devil West Line has not only established an obelisk in the mountains of the spine, but also opened up a supply line that runs through the mountains. Not only can it prevent the deviation from heading, but also allow the supply line to share the red fog pressure, which is a safe route."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The specific number of the latter is unknown, but since it is It’s not an exaggeration to judge the devils who can fight. According to the current speed, they can reach the borders of the four kingdoms in one and a half months.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When it comes to the number of enemies, Roland notices that some people have some fear on their faces.However, this can't blame them. After two wars of gods, humanity is badly hurt. Are there any survivors who say nothing, let alone soldiers who can be used for combat. For Barov and others, there is no difference between a million scale and an astronomical number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a blow to the enemy's wreck, and it is also a battle to determine the destiny of mankind. The island of Elinor must start immediately, before the enemy approaches the desperate mountains. Block the pace of their advancement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
