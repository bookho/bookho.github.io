			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Roland was ready to go to the snowy mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes camping tents, plenty of dry food, and a cement paddle boat. Since the location of the Devil's Camp is on the side of the sea, he must be out of the shallows - according to the usual practice, the transportation work is done by hummingbirds. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that when the hummingbird, which is comparable to Nana Wa, grabbed the ship's side and slammed the entire cement boat over the top of the head, the scene looked very strange. It’s like an ant moving a grain that is several times larger than himself. If she keeps the boat on her side and looks from the other side, she can see a ghost that slides silently on the 6th floor. The boat is up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as her hands don’t leave the boat, they can maintain this state, and this enchantment is more than the initial cost of canceling the object. Fast, the magic cost is also much lower. The only drawback is that the hummingbird must act in conjunction with the enchanted object, so that at most two goods can be handled at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paddle boat headed west along the mountain and arrived at the rocky beach two days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time Roland was still far from the distant view of the land, and now stepping on the rocky beach for the first time, he immediately gave birth to a sense of desolateness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery here is very different from the shoal. The short tens of miles of roads are like two worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rocky beach is covered with corpses of various animals, which are embedded in layers of gravel, some of which have been weathered, and some are gradually being transformed into new ones. stone. Some of the bones look very thick, almost the same as the adult's torso, and I don't know what creatures are left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steep rock wall is also strange and bizarre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless sharp stalagmites growing on the rock surface, which are different from the natural drooping shape in the cave. They are all picked up laterally and the ends are lifted up. At first glance it looks like countless barbs. This kind of landscape that violates gravity is incredible. The last time I saw it on the balloon, I would only feel creepy if I was physically on this rocky beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long beachhead can’t find a trace of life, there are no seabirds that inhabit, and there are no algae or sea otters, even after the stone walls. An empty space, as if the red mist of the devil took away all the vitality here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the mark left by Lotus, Roland and his entourage found the slit leading to the camp. Rather than a slit, it is better to say that it is a fault, and the slender opening almost opens the entire cliff, and it does not bottom out. It is in this steep fracture that the lotus extends a narrow path of half a meter wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When stepping into the "first-line sky" along the stone steps, the nightingale couldn't help but marvel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Roland couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look there," she pointed to the depths of the gap, "There is a hole in the rock!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The team stopped and looked at them. In the dark and dull position near the bottom, Roland saw several circular holes, like what was cut out. "What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, such a hole I have seen in the mountains, but it is bigger," she hesitated Then, "and the deeper the bottom, the more I feel that there is something inside watching me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something?" Roland groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than one," the nocturnal nodded. "Just in the valley leading to the camp, there is a small path leading to a deeper underground. But I have never been there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When Sylvie returns, take her to the mountains of the desolate mountains," he looked at the bottom of the fault again. , press the urge to send people to climb down and explore, and then let the team move on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this big 6 is part of the glory, there have been records of human settlements thousands of years ago, but the perception of the world has remained very primitive. The state is like people deliberately neglecting to open up. Roland once mentioned the Big 6 map to Ai Gesha, but was told that the Federation only detailed the fertile plains, and the 曙光境 has only a rough outline, and nothing is known outside the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
