			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the prince returned to the office, the scrolls followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, sorry, Lily's child...not intentional."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Don't care," he smiled. "She's just a little girl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only you are so tolerant of us," the book sighed. She is not like this at first. After being deceived, she is now hard to believe in ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was before joining the club He asked, "I remember that she only joined you for a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is indeed the case, I found her on the outskirts of Chishuicheng. The book said, "You know, I can feel the existence of magic. The closer the distance is, the stronger it is. Although it can not directly see the shape and color of the magic like the nightingale, it can at least be used to discover new witches. Every time I go through a town, I will pretend to be a noble lady who wants to adopt a child. I will go to a local shelter or orphanage to look for it. Awakened sisters." She paused. "Lily was locked up in a remote township shelter, but when I named her to adopt her, she was rejected. The owner of the shelter told me that they Here only sells adult girls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Roland wondered. The witch’s latest awakening time is before adulthood. Is it related to this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the time we felt very strange, so I let the nightingale sneak into the shelter and look for the books, records and related information. Fortunately, the shelter is far from the town. So we can stay here for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you take Lily directly? With the help of the nightingale, shouldn't it be difficult?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not difficult," the book nodded. "In addition to the stone worn by the operator, there are no other stones or institutions in the shelter." But we can't do this. There are precedents for this kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What precedent?" The prince soaked the tea for the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," she took the teacup. "In the beginning, as long as we found the witch, we would forcefully take her away, but a change happened in Haifeng County. Changed our approach. At that time, a young witch who had just awakened thought that we were evil. After being brought back to the Communist Youth League, she did not listen to the explanation and launched an attack on us. In the end, two sisters died and she was also injured. The "death penalty" is killed by the devil. So from then on, we will carefully watch the witch for a period of time, determine her situation and ideas before taking action. If the church is in urgent need, we can only choose to give up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the encounter between Nightingale and Wendy is not accidental?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not," the book sipped a cup of tea and smiled and shook his head. "From the discovery of the nightingale to Wendy's contact, it's just a gap." During the months, we also recruited other sisters, such as red peppers and chasing the wind...” She said that her expression was bleak, “unfortunately they were all buried in the wild. If you start from the very beginning, you should choose to stay in the town. "Russian is also very sorry. If more than forty witches gather in the town, I am afraid that it has entered modern life.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say those," the book took a deep breath, "still telling Lily." After searching the shelters and tracking the owner's tracks, we found an astonishing fact that this small country house was neither a real shelter nor a screening for witches. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it for? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to satisfy the operator's own desires. "Even if it is as good as a book, it looks a bit gloomy when you say this." The operators go to the slums of Chishui City every week to abduct the street girls and deceive them. They are a kind-hearted aristocrat. In the suburbs, there is a shelter, where there are often large nobles who choose to go to the door to choose a foster daughter. As long as they are selected, they will not have to worry about eating and drinking for the rest of their lives. Not everyone will be deceived, but... In the past decade or so, there have been hundreds of girls who have been to the shelters. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
