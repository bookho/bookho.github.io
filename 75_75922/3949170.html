			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The production of cement is quickly on the right track. In order to allow Anna to rest fully, the firing will take two to three days to start. When not calcining, more raw materials were prepared as much as possible. For this reason, Roland issued a recruitment order again, which doubled the number of gravel workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also knows that he can’t always rely on Anna to do these things. Long-term work in the dusty environment will make people suffer from silicosis, and with the expansion of production scale in the future, an Anna is far from enough to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women should not be used as consumables, but should be used as an engine to promote the development of civilization. Although Roland understands this in mind, it is still only possible to invest all of his energy in the construction of the city wall. Can't stop the evil beast, everything can't be talked about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foundation of the city wall connecting Beipo Mountain and Chishui River has been started. According to the pre-traversal practice, as the general manager of the project, he personally dug out the first shoveling in front of a crowd of people who were horrified. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that after the cement problem was solved, it was easy to build a city wall. Actually, it was discovered that he did not know anything about the project. How deep is the foundation to dig? How to solve the unevenness of the location? How to ensure the length of more than 600 meters in a straight line? He did see a group of young men looking at the instrument and the ruler when he saw the municipal road repair. It seems to be called the theodolite and the level? But nothing here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mechanical drawing dog, Roland, while moving bricks and bricks next door, said that the science and technology double dogs, but the content of the study is far away. None of the hired mud craftsmen participated in the construction of large-scale projects, which is worse than their own. Therefore, after the construction of the city wall, the progress was extremely slow, and half of the shallow trenches were dug in a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the project is out of control, it is hard to say what the final product will look like. For example, this shallow groove that is hard to dig out is not so much the foundation of the city wall, but rather the appropriateness of the drainage ditch. Although Roland had a rough width when excavating, the width of the digging and digging was obviously more and more narrow. Standing in the distance, it looks like a small snake twisted and twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, Roland is not willing to stop working. In the spirit of being able to dig a little bit, as long as the firing room does not start, he will stay at the foot of the north slope all day, adjust the direction of the foundation pit with the naked eye, and slowly advance. At the same time, he will also double the reward for the stone craftsmen. Fortunately, this kind of embarrassment did not last long. When Roland directed the firing of the sixth batch of cement in the firing room, the assistant minister Barov reported that there was a stone craftsman response. Recruitment, also said that it will stay in the gray castle stonemason, people have been taken outside the hospital waiting to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought back a little, and the graysmith stonemason would be a famous organization in his memory, even the four princes had heard their names. Although it seems that a construction accident was ordered to be disbanded, but what can be done without doing this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take him in," Roland put on a calm expression and nodded. He originally wanted to ask Anna to avoid it, but then she thought about it. There are more than 2,000 people in Bianbu Town, and there are not many people who have seen the real face of witches. Moreover, Anna’s appearance at this time has been judged by two people when she was desperately dying. Adding a strange dress, it is estimated that even if she has seen it, she will not recognize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlbert was uneasy when he was brought into the yard by the Cavaliers. He planned to tell His Highness that this season is not suitable for large-scale projects, after obtaining the trust of His Royal Highness. Slowly change his view of the witch. It can be rumored that the Highness has always acted unscrupulously. What should I do if I disagree? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was stunned and stunned, but he looked up when he looked up - the girl next to His Royal Highness was so familiar that he was dreaming of himself. illusion. Carl rubbed his eyes and looked again. He couldn't help but shout out, "...Anna!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lying in the trough, Roland’s heart was so bad, this It’s also a coincidence. Just recruit a craftsman to recruit a witch’s neighbor. It can be seen that the other party is absolutely familiar enough with Anna, otherwise it is impossible to identify it in a face-to-face time. He turned to look at Carter Lannis, the chief knight, and immediately pulled the door bolt and blocked it on the only exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old... Teacher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna’s reaction made Roland never return , what, teacher? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
