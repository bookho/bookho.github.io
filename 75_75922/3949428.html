			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland held the first high-level plenary session of Bianbu Town in the castle lounge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city hall has grown to a large group of nearly a hundred people compared to the original scene of Barov and his more than a dozen apprentices. Aristocrats, captive knights and enemies, and aborigines who have completed primary education and obtained a diploma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to the growth of the population, various departments have also taken shape, so that the City Hall finally has a little prince expectation. He doesn't have to do everything himself as he did before. Now, with some simple policies and plans, as soon as he confesses, this rudimentary city hall can dismantle the task to various departments, which makes Roland feel full. It is gratifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participants of the first high-level meeting were all the top leaders of the department, namely Minister of Agriculture Sene Dali, Secretary of Education, and head of the Ministry of Chemical Industry Camo Spoel (temporary), Construction Minister Carl Vabert, Army Chief Axe and City Hall Director Barov Mons. The Ministry of Industry is still managed by Roland himself. After all, no one but him knows what industrialization is like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a bucket of ice water around them, emitting a burst of cool air - the ice in the bucket is enchanted by candlelight, soaked in water At least one morning can last. Even if the sun is burning outside, the castle hall still maintains a cool temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore, each department separately reported the recent situation," Roland took the kettle out of the bucket and poured himself a glass of ice water. "Starting from the Ministry of Agriculture." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Highness." Sene got up and took a gift, then spread out the prepared paper roll, "The food that was turned over this time." At around 17,000, this number is enough to meet the food needs of all the townspeople in the summer of the year. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture purchases the surplus food at the market price according to your request, but this number is far. Less than the rate of surrender, there are currently only 4,500 baht."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called "斛" is a commonly used wheat weighing container, one made of bamboo The scorpion, so this number is also to listen to it, he does not know how to convert to kilograms or liters - fortunately these are not important, the key is that he knows that the food collected can support the townspeople is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key lies in the second point. If the calculation is based on 70% of the retention of 70%, the purchased food should be around 7,000, reserved for food and next. The part of the seed is not used at all. In other words, some serfs did not sell the remaining 30% of the food to the city hall, but chose to hoard it in the wooden shed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was foreseen in the early morning, he still sighed when he actually happened. The purpose of the grain is obvious, that is, it is intended to speculate and sell it. If there is insufficient food supply in the town or a natural disaster, they will be able to sell a much higher price than the market price. no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Roland has set the food transaction as a town hall franchise and the purchaser must present the identity card. The food issue is related to the most basic stability of Bianbu Town. In the case that the grain is not surplus in the early stage, if the sale is restricted, it is easy to be hoarded by the purchase of people, and finally the food price will rise. The real-name system purchases quantitative food, while prohibiting other sales channels, in order to maintain the grain price on a stable line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, why don't you force the acquisition of wheat in the hands of the serfs?" Sene asked questioningly. "The law is not allowed to sell to others." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because that is their private property, how to deal with them is their freedom," Roland replied. "I did not stipulate that serfs are not allowed to keep their own food. You also It can be understood that as long as the plain text is not prohibited, it is allowed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sene seems to be confused and does not seem to know how to understand this sentence. Not only him, most people frowned, only Barov showed a thoughtful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there anything else to report?" Roland drank a sip of water, and the idea of ​​emphasizing rules and procedures was only waiting for them to slowly comprehend. Or, to understand this, can be regarded as a qualified official in a new era. Of course, this set is also easy to go to the other extreme, leading to the emergence of bureaucracy, but how bureaucratization is better than chaos or chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...Yes," said Seneley Daly. "Now the fields have been harvested. I don’t know how to arrange the fallow plan for the next year." ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
