			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, there is nothing wrong with the previous batches, but then... we don't need so many intermediate teachers?" Barov asked. Although he seems to be somewhat lost, most of his attention is still focused on the issue. This mature performance makes Roland quite satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Intermediate teachers are not the only place for these people. In addition to receiving a higher level of education, other production positions will also have corresponding researchers and managers. - They should not only know how to operate machinery, but also know its principles. They can train workers, maintain equipment, and even propose improvements." Roland screamed. "It is meaningless to have a large population. The Ministry of Education wants What they do is to convert them into industrial personnel as much as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Industrial staff?" The book was repeated in a low voice. "Is it a producer?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be understood," he said in detail the idea he had long conceived in his mind. "Anyone who has received primary education is competent." Workers, they are the first-level industrial personnel. These people decide the scale of the winter city industry. The more people there are, the bigger the scale. But only the big one is not enough... The town hall can’t manage so many things, so after that There should be two out of every 100 people. People have intermediate education levels, they can not only be used as workers, but also in management positions. The same is true for senior educators, and so on, to form a group that can self-replace and act in accordance with the instructions of the City Hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is essential to the success of the population. At present, there is no sufficient resources for the winter city, and it is impossible to fully carry out the middle and high-level compulsory education. Roland does not have much time to wait for the talents to mature. Therefore, scholarships are used to select and train a group of capable people. Most of the rest of the people, as long as they have completed primary education, can read and write, and directly distribute them to various production posts, becoming a screw in the rapid development of no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand." The book should be answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is another point to join the ideological education section in primary education." Roland tapped the table and couldn’t help but recall the ideological and moral education in her dreams. Textbooks, the role of armed thinking in this era may not be much smaller than the steam engine. "I will write the lesson to you in the specific content."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the book nod after He stood up and looked around everyone. "In general, the main tasks of the City Hall this year and next are to expand the population, develop education, and upgrade the scale of the industry. The first two are the most critical, and the winter is decided. The upper limit of the development of the city and the entire kingdom. I hope that before the arrival of the more terrible and powerful enemy, everyone can do their duty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "For the King's Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All officials stood up in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For your own sake," Roland exhaled. "Today's meeting is here, right...Kemo Stoll, come to my office." A trip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief alchemist came to the office with Roland and just closed the door. I asked straightforwardly, "Your Majesty, do you have any new ideas or new products to be produced? If not, I hope to go back to the laboratory early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You are as impatient as ever," Roland couldn't help but smile. "Sit down and talk slowly. I have something important to give to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; When Kemo sat down suspiciously, he did not rush to drink tea. "How have the alchemists of Wangdu been doing recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not bad, except for the exchanges on the chemical test, I don't have much to do with them," the chief alchemist frowned. "Let's ask me if you ask me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the Wangdu Alchemy Association still forms a small group - although the many apprentices they bring to the chemical industry are very helpful, but also easy in the momentum Overwhelm local students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has changed the subject quietly. "Today, the production of two acids and smokeless* gunpowder has reached a considerable scale and will be doubled later. Expanding, I intend to officially separate this industry from a new department," he paused for a moment. "Have you considered the minister of the Ministry of Chemical Industry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
