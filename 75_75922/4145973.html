			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Wakiris shook his head, calmed himself down, and the cloud school did not exist anymore. This is an undisputed fact. Since the occupation of the northwest side of the glory, it has returned to the mountain every 100 years and stayed in the long-lost and ruined building for a day or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was once a member of the school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the mountain, it not only learned how to connect with the ideology, but also mastered a lot of knowledge of the human world. The person who teaches it is a promoter of the "Thousand Shapes" Sistalis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is not outstanding in combat ability, not even a strong original body, which is a joke between the ethnic groups. But Wakiris is clear that the promotion ceremony will not reduce the difficulty because the fusion magic stone is not suitable for combat. The three integrations of the other party are impeccable. In any respect, it is a real promotion. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with its title, the Thousand Shapes gained the ability to change shape when merging the second magic stone, so it rarely shows people in the true face, most of the time It is a human form, plus a fluent human language. If you don't know the details, the first time you meet, it will be regarded as human. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most used appearance is the "岚" in the TV screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris is staring at the face, countless memories are coming to my heart. For more than a thousand years... Although there are subtle differences in the details of the five senses and clothing, this face will never be forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the sages who established the cloud school are heterogeneous among human beings, then the "thousands" are the aliens among them, and they never choose the magic stone. He valued his ability to improve his strength, and was curious about anything he had not tried. He was also the first to actively contact the Yunxiao school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the voice of the "war of the gods" has been faintly hidden in the ethnic group, and the humans who occupy the ray of light are regarded as potential enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this guide who taught most of its knowledge, Vakiris has always been grateful, it is not because the other party is not good at fighting, it is contemptuous . It is incomparably clear. The degree of acceptance and understanding of the ideology to the ideology, that is, the source of magic, far exceeds that of other ethnic groups. More than a dozen books written by it have become the ladder to guide the promotion of the ethnic group. According to humans, it can be called the "mentor" of most people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the "thousands" may be the first to accept the fourth fusion of the tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If successful, it will also become the first "Mahara" in the community. I have to know that there are not even the original body at that time, let alone the Maharaja. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the ceremony ended in failure, it was reversed by magic, and there was no bone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiri’s clearly remembered this scene because it was at the side of the other side and saw the other’s body collapse a little. This is also the reason why it feels "unfamiliar" strange, and it has never seen a similar person since it has been for more than a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris once asked the thousand shapes, why should they become this look--unlike the simulated human appearance, it is convinced that this face is not Belong to any sage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party’s answer made it completely incomprehensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It says this is what a god makes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the ambassador, the thousand-shaped saying that he is not very clear, when it uses the ability to enter the conscious world, occasionally encounters a distinctly different consciousness. - The other party is as if whispering in its mind, although they have never really seen it, afterwards it can recall the appearance of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of Shapes also said that this may be the reason for its lack of ability. If it can open up a stable area in the ideology of the turbulent flow, Maybe you can connect with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Wakiris could not understand the meaning of this statement. It was not long before it was first promoted, and the understanding of the consciousness circle was still blank. It can be said that Qiang has led the ethnic group for hundreds of years in this respect. Until the second eve of the war of gods, Wang did this and succeeded in leaving a field of his own in the ideology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
