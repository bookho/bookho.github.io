			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After explaining everything, Roland returned to the building as quickly as possible, only to find that he still underestimated Garcia's alertness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a familiar figure leaning against the corridor at the entrance of 0825, talking on the phone while overlooking the busy people in the downstairs. She wore a gray and white t-shirt, and the lower part was loose black trousers and high-top shoes, which looked youthful and energetic. If you don't know the true identity of the other person, Roland will definitely regard her as the kind of lively and cheerful neighbor girl who often appears on TV. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she can see some anger at her face at the moment, she has no sense of coldness and harshness in her memory. I have to say that after taking off the gorgeous brocade robes, this casual and simple sports dress unexpectedly coincides with the three kings of Wimbledon and the former Red Sea Queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When arriving at the door of the house, Garcia also noticed Roland. "That's it. I still have something to do. I will hang it first. If I just want to persuade me later, Please don't call it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the Sanye family come up with the demolition?" Roland asked as if nothing had happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has nothing to do with you," she put away the phone, revealing a look of suspicion. "Where are you going? Isn't it a bath?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know how to eliminate odor? One is cleaning, the other is covering up with another taste," he said. The little girl who lives in my house is going to school, eager to use the bathroom, I can't always fight with her? So I just thought about going down two laps and sweating the same. I didn't expect the body to sweat very little. No wonder the martial arts look always clean - well, these are not important, the important thing is that I don't sneak, but stand in front of you, isn't it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Garcia stared at him for a while before he said, "I don't want to interfere with your private life, but it's not a good thing to indulge yourself. What's more... there is education here. Question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Roland couldn't help but see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those girls," Garcia frowned. "The ones who went out of your house... can't you get out of the knot? Have you brought them home?" I thought you forgot that there was a little girl in the house."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland almost didn't get caught up in this conversation - in order to get rid of it Luo, he deliberately staggered the time, waiting for the little guy to go to school and then let the Taqila witch break the consciousness and enter the dream. As for others, it is not important to see it. When I just said it from the mouth of Garcia, it completely changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is true that some martial artists will become less cautious after becoming famous - money and name are always easy to lose themselves, but don't forget, we are Those who fight for this world must always maintain high morale and never let go. Being addicted to desire will only make your hand dull..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Cough, I understand," Roland saw the other side to carry out an ideological and moral education, and quickly interrupted her. "These can talk later, let me change my clothes first? Don't delay the departure time." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia closed his mouth unpleasantly and gave him a look. "...Go ahead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some care, Roland deliberately put on a newly purchased suit and walked out of the door in the eyes of Jie Luo’s surprise. Before leaving, he did not forget to put the fried poached eggs made by the little hoe into a fresh-keeping bag and prepare to enjoy it on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are..." Garcia, who was at the door, blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time I went to the headquarters, it was natural to officially be better," Roland shrugged. "It’s also into the system. It’s too casual to look a little disrespectful. "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha...you can," she shook her head. "But I didn't think that you dressed like this...and It’s pretty good.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, for a penny, Roland’s heart is thinking that this custom-made dress can cost him a lot of “robbery”. fee". After all, people rely on clothing, as long as it is not ugly and incurable, dressing up, and then put on a pair of clothes will be instantly shaped, not to mention the body of the body itself is very well-balanced, plus a long gray hair Change to his original world, saying that the elf prince has a letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get on the bus," Garcia whispered. I don't know if it is an illusion. Her look is a lot more serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland boarding fashion looks inadvertently, looking at the side of the long street, I saw that Felice has reached out and stopped a taxi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the car door closed, the bus was not as dark as he thought, the lights on both sides of the aisle were all lit, and the seats were scattered. Sitting many people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are mostly in a variety of styles. They look like a group of performance artists. There are a few normal ones, and they all do their own things. No one is the same. Garcia said hello. However, Roland was keenly aware that since the car was on, several guys have set their sights on him, and his feeling of being unwilling is quite obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia did not say a word, abnormally pulled Roland's hand and took him directly to the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These people are not your colleagues?" he whispered after sitting down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The martial arts association is not a company," Garcia gave him a blank look. "The people in the car are mostly like you, the new awakening person, I It’s also the first time I saw it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So much?” Roland was a little surprised, he roughly counted, and the car was almost twenty people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of people. The last time I went to the association was only five or six people... but this is not surprising," Garcia said. "Although ordinary people are right. The world's changes are ignorant, but the awakened person who holds the power of nature can always detect something different. Remember what I said before? Not all awakened people will stand on our side, the middle school is no better than the association. There are fewer martial arts families. Nowadays erosion has intensified, and more and more demon people have appeared, making their situation more dangerous. In the future, there will be more and more people who will fall to the association."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So most of the cars are wild martial arts, or are they scattered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Describe very well, "Jia Xia raised his mouth. "I guess it’s all right, but you can say it privately, don’t say it in front of them. The reason why these people don’t want to join the association is because they don’t want to be bound. After an ordinary person has power, if the mentality is not correct, it is easy to produce a kind of illusory I am proud to think that I am an extraordinary person. This not only hinders their progress, but also makes their temper very strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last point I have Feel it," Roland didn't think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was a conflict like this before, joining the wild of the association... The martial artist killed several members of the association in a hunting mission. The impact was extremely bad. Finally, the "guard" came out to destroy it. Therefore, if they are provocative, they will not be seen as if they have not seen it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wild awakened are so strong? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" These people often encounter attacks by demon people, and they will be better than the new awakened in actual combat experience and emergency judgment. But as long as you practice hard and become addicted to desire, you will grow faster than they do – after all, they are divided into too much energy by the vulgar. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, Garcia sighed. "The power of nature is the means of self-protection that God has given us, not the tools used to plunder others." If erosion cannot be prevented, the whole world may no longer exist, and many people forget their responsibilities while enjoying the power to bring pleasure. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is quite a feeling of deja vu... Roland thought about it, maybe more than 800 years ago, those witches who realized the harm of the devil were also Under such a state of mind, the establishment of the federation?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the window suddenly quieted down, and the friction between the wheel and the ground became thick and single. It’s like driving alone in an empty tunnel.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the bus finally stopped.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of Roland’s arrival at the destination, the body trembled slightly, and then a clear sense of weightlessness rose from his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
