			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a tent, Sean looked at the man who was tied to the chair, and the latter did not look away or loud. Noisy, watching him calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This silence is not like a look that will appear on the whistle-blower. When he was still in the old kingdom, Sean saw many betrayals and betrayals. Although the enemy's rebellion is only good for oneself, the ugly, savage, and impatient ugliness will not be pleasing to the eye because of a little benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made the guards feel a little curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching it for a while, he broke the silence, "Name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Joe." The man replied, "Are you the commander here? I mean "here" not the thorns of the thorn town or the place, but the head of the Grey Fort. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that important?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If not, I will not say anything, because... it doesn't make sense." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a bit interesting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn leaned forward slightly, "I am the king of the Grey Fort." The chief of the guards of Roland Wimbledon is also the captain of the Grey Fort Exploration Team. You can call me Sean. Now that you have seen the people you want to see, can you talk about the whereabouts of the treasures? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you come to the caged mountain to curse the temple, then you must find the ritual cube," Joe said bluntly. "And this way." Something, now in the hands of the Count of Dagong Island, Lorenzo! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn couldn't help but feel some accidents. He thought that the other party would talk about the conditions first, and then give a part of the clues. If it is true or not, it will take time." To verify, I didn't expect the other party to pay the bill directly. "You have seen... that thing? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, but for the church, this is no secret," Joe simply told the church to plunder the wolf. "At the time, in order to express Lorenzo, who was in charge of this task, rendered this treasure in the report. Many senior officials knew about it, but it did not attract the attention of the holy city of Hermes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original thing is that the treasures flowed into the wolf heart in a hundred years, and then were captured by the church. This is a kind of plausible intelligence." "Shaun touched his chin. "But why should you tell me specifically?" If you sell the message to other lords, can't you say that it doesn't make sense? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy took a deep breath. "Adult, have you heard of... God's fine army?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the secret army that the church is proud of," Sean showed a mockery. "Unfortunately, in the Cold Wind Ridge, it was still shackled." The first army was defeated. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is fine," but the other party did not show any sorrow. "The next step is to explain." Lorenzo has a god-prisoner in his hands. No one dares to play the idea of ​​Dagong Island except the king of the Grey Fort. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? "The pro-guard raised my eyebrows," I thought that these humanoid beasts had died in the crater of the Windwind Ridge. How many gods were there? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten...no, about five people," Joe hesitated. "In short, it won't be too much." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to attack the castle, the five are also a big threat. "Shaun smiled and couldn't help. "So what do you want from me?" Or, what is the bid for this information? "No, I just hope to survive," Joe whispered. "The church is no longer the opponent of the Grey Fort, but those exiles are still Do not give up, Lorenzo is still playing your attention, his people are likely to have mixed into the town of thorns, I do not want to be dragged down by them. If..." He paused for a moment, "If these messages can be used, should the king of the Grey Fortress forgive me not guilty?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you really want to live this way?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn hands on the table, with The hand is against the chin - this is also the action that Roland has often made in questioning questions. Although he does not have the ability to be a god of the night, sometimes there is no need for magic to distinguish the true and false.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
