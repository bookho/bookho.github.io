			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After laying the quilt, turn around and blow out the candle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room suddenly dimmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the electric light and the magic stone, the life of returning to the candle lighting is really not very suitable. It is always commonplace to go out in the wild, she Slightly funny thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is no way, the urgent time does not allow the installation of a full set of electrical lighting system on the floating island, even the place for them to rest, is also Fula They drilled on the rock wall. Then, Soloya laid a layer of soft layer to isolate the moisture from the ground, which became a bedroom. The furniture also has the most common wooden tables and simple wardrobes, and the mattresses are laid directly on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella is also on the floating island, but the most need for the magic stone lighting is the factory that is rushing to work, so that her converted stone can provide life. It is estimated that the district will be used for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is simple and simple, but it is not uncomfortable to live. One person does not have a single room, but also has a separate bathroom. Plus the ventilation tube that leads directly to the outer wall of the floating island, the room is not boring at all. At the end of the cave there is also a public reading room and a hot spring bath to meet the daily needs of the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is not of much interest, but the latter is really great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghosts know how Pasha found this place - the streams that seep from the top of the mountain merge into a clear spring in the caves of the mountains, and the poolside Some of them extend out of the wall and can be seen by the pool. Especially after the floating island flies up, this place is convenient to become a superb view overlooking the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will soak in the spring water after a shower every day to enjoy this moment of relaxing time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the shortcomings of not having a light in the room have become insignificant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the nightingale was about to lie down, a knock on the door suddenly sounded outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldnâ€™t help but swear, this time is late at night, everyone is basically asleep, who else will come to her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale should scream, re-light the candle, and in the mind Several alternative characters emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most likely of these is Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the head of the league has had several times to drink more wine to find her precedent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, pushing the door opened her and slammed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually Anna standing outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is holding a small wooden barrel with a towel and other cleaning items. "Can you take a bath with me?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale has been washed before going to sleep, but she realizes that this time the bath is obviously not the focus, "Of course, wait a moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pack up things and follow Anna all the way into the bathhouse, the entire cave is empty, no one but them. From time to time, the sound of water droplets splashing on stalagmites sounded from the ear, and it was extraordinarily quiet in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undressing and stepping into the pool, the nightingale suddenly felt a heat flow wrapped around the body - unlike no winter city, the amount of fuel on the floating island is extremely limited Therefore, the boiler and steam engine powered by Rubik's cube are widely used, and the water supply can be guaranteed for 24 hours in the water supply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two set aside the white fog and slowly walked to the hole. In an instant, the cool evening breeze sweeps away the sultry heat in the cave, and the world in front of us is suddenly open, and the eyes that are in their eyes are no longer the mountains and rocks, but the stars and the endless night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night can't help but snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is really intoxicating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
