			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge change makes Aegusa feel awkward, she doesn't want to believe what the other person said, but the stories sound very real – if not experienced Over, which witch can come up with such a miserable encounter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change to herself, it is impossible to imagine that I was enslaved and hunted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is an ordinary person with a low status in the Holy City, it is a person, not an animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt extremely tired. Wendy seemed to see her discomfort and brought a cup of hot milk. "Drink this, you will feel better." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This red-haired woman, although not like the gods, has the power and power to overwhelm all beings, but still infects her like a flame, not hot And dazzling, but warm as water... She drank milk, as if the sweetness she hadn't tasted for a long time had flowed into her stomach, and she had recovered a little strength. After a short break, the conversation continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t understand why a group of witches are wary and wary of another group of witches, but want them to believe in themselves, to unlock the stone of the gods, they must first obtain The trust of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the words that the prince and Wendy said, there is some credibility, which must be confirmed by their own eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before witnessing this narrow and backward wild land, she would not believe that the Federation would disappear without a trace, as if it had never existed before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As I said before, my name is Ai Gesha, from the Tacila Discovery Society. In the fifth year of the Battle of God, as the last holy city. Tahira did not persist until the end of the war. Most people began their escape journey, and I went to the lost forest to retrieve some of the legacy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait... Are you fighting the devil?" asked the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha frowned. "Who is there be us? Do you rely on ordinary people like you?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the witch of the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the church, I have never heard of it," she said impatiently. Takira... No, all the holy cities are built by witches. There are tens of thousands of people living there. Most of them except the witches are ordinary people like you. They are responsible for giving birth and caring for children until the child wakes up. Handed over to a specialized organization. Of course, witches who are good at fighting will join the federation and fight the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince pondered for a moment, then took out a copy The book was handed to her. "Can you read what you wrote above?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha flipped two pages and was quickly drawn to the eye. "This is... the witch's diary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you use this text?" asked a light gray-haired witch<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The union created, in order to separate the words used by ordinary people, so that they can not participate in the upper level of affairs, although I do not think this It’s a good idea.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How is it done?” she curiously said, “If it’s just another set of words, can ordinary people master it by learning?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Need to use magic," Ai Gesha explained. "It's not too difficult. If you are a witch, I can teach you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The text itself is a tool for communication. The wider the popularity, the better. It is really stupid," the prince commented. "Excluding the ordinary person is equal to It greatly reduces the range of manpower available to you. In fact, after training and education, ordinary people can be qualified for many positions, and they will not be worse than magic."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His thoughts are just like himself, Ai Gesha is not used to a mortal to the Federation Set to make irresponsible remarks, she can accept and people did not have the magic of collaboration, but they do not like to stand in front of their own gesticulating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She began to miss some of Kraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is the book, Miss Aisha," another witch who looked very old suddenly asked, "Have you ever heard of the name of Akaris?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha’s hand shook a little. “Where did you hear the name? Didn’t it mean that everything was lost four hundred and fifty years ago?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found an ancient book in a ruin of the Grey Forest East Forest," the book said. "This is the book in your hand. The last page shows her name, and it is common. The words of the person were written."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha quickly turned to the last page, read through the few scribbled notes, sighed for a long time. . In her mind, the woman who raised the sword and summoned the radiance of the world was once again revealed. Only this time in the memory of the scene, the shadow of the golden light has expanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a long while, she slowly said, "Akaris, the queen of the comet city, is also one of the three seats of the federation. She is a high-class extraordinary person, also known as the supernatural. Even in the many Congregational Saints of the Federation, she is the most powerful one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Extraordinary... above?" There was a discussion in the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since this knowledge has been lost, you don't know it is normal," Ai Gesha said. "The witch's ability is growing from awakening. And it solidifies on adult day. But this is not the end of ability. Through its own comprehension, feelings and practice, there are very few lucky ones who can go further and make the ability incredibly strengthened... We call it a high-level awakening. There is no upper limit to the awakening, and there is no hard division of the increase, but it can be observed from the magical form."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, is the ability to evolve?" Touching the back of the head, "Okay, there are four witches in the Witch Alliance who have evolved their abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Aegusa almost stunned, "4. Four? How many members of the Witch League?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party has figured out, "Ten people."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not talk nonsense if you don't know!" She looked a little angry. Four out of ten people can awaken high-level? You don't know what it means, don't compare it with the solidification and branching ability of adulthood, it's not the same thing! Can be promoted, all in one The darling of the gods, the opportunities and their own efforts are indispensable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince seemed helpless, he waved, "Anna."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful and calm girl, Ai Gesha looked at the witch who went to the bed, and she commented. Even in the witch, this appearance is very outstanding, her blue eyes are like the water surface of Yingyuebing Lake, so clear that I can see my reflection. But she is too young, I am afraid that she is just a grown-up, and she has no experience in training, feelings and comprehension. To know that you are 26 years old when you are advanced, you can already be regarded as a genius who is outstanding in the Federation. Only after you have experienced it will you understand how difficult it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably they regard the branching ability of adulthood as a high-level awakening, and Ai Gesha thinks in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of orange-lit flames appeared in Anna’s palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flame ability, a very common summoning type, can use the highest temperature and heating rate to measure the mastery level, can be ejected can be regarded as a fighting woman," she Evaluation will be made soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words just finished, the flame instantly dimmed and turned into a singular flame, which slowly changed its color, from dark green to light green But no matter what, the green flame seems to fill the light around it to fill itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is her ability to solidify in adulthood, and then the focus," the prince explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cure? No... how can this be cured? Adults should only make the flames more hot, and the flames are brighter and bigger. She couldn't help but grow her mouth, and what is the next point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Ai Gesha saw an incredible scene - the green fire disappeared, replaced by a black square, which is completely devoid of flames. It is like a matte metal square. The walls are smooth and flat, and they are clearly defined in the hands of the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
