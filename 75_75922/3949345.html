After I approached, Irene exclaimed with disbelief, then grabbed her hand and pulled it In front of the Cavaliers, "Dear, do you know who she is? She is the most famous actor in the Fortress Theatre, Miss Mey! People who want to see her performance can go to the street from the theater hall!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although that dear let Mey’s heart jump, the habit of acting all year round made her reflexively curl up her mouth and nodded slightly, “Hello.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly know, you said that she is the most famous actor, who in the Western aristocrats do not know the name of the theater star," he sighed and apologized to Mey. "It’s my wife’s rudeness. I’m a film, hello.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t have a registration number, didn’t report his identity, and even his last name was hidden. There was a sorrow in Mei's heart, but on the surface, he still maintained the most elegant posture. "I know you. The first knight in the West, "Dawn in the morning," Sir William Hilter. It was a pity that I was unable to attend the wedding of you and Irene because of the nervousness of the drama. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's all in the past," the knight shook his head with a smile. "I am a teacher now, no longer a Hilter family." People, you don't need to be so polite. "When he finished talking to other people, "Go back and talk again. The place where you have stayed has already applied." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher? Does Mey swear, is it a court tutor? The lord of this town is indeed a prince, but the prince who is no longer behind As for the Cavaliers to take up this position. And what does it mean to apply for temporary residence? Shouldn’t I have a group of people to go to a safe and secure hotel in the local area?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Not too late to think about these issues, Irene has come together. "God, I really didn't expect you to come here." If "Cinderella" is played by you, it will definitely cause a sensation! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? "Mei is undecided, a play name that I have never heard of, probably written by a new dramatist. And she has no time to rehearse the drama, come here... just want to see how the dawn dawns, maybe I can't help but have a place to help him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the town, Mey found something wrong - it is clearly located at the border In addition, the barren town that serves as the fortification station of the fortress, why does it look like a new city? The road is covered with gray-black gravel, the mud floor is not visible, and the street is too wide, almost You can pass two carriages side by side.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this way? Sam asked the doubts in her heart. "It's strange to go." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Irene smiled smugly. "I was muddy when I first came here. It is now like this." And this is not the way, listen to the stonemasons, this is only the basis of the road. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They yell at you," Luo Xia retorted. "Only the house needs the foundation, the things lying on the ground, how can it not be embarrassed, what do you want?" Basic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really, they are flattened with a gray powder and stone, sprinkled with water and pressed with a stone roller until the ground is flat . I began to think that this is a new way of road construction, but the stonemason said that this is the practice of His Royal Highness, it seems to be... what layer of water, in short, the foundation! Irene took her hand and led the way in the forefront. The long scorpion swayed and swayed. "There are more people waiting for the car and the car. The slate floor will be paved here. That is the real road." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slate floor, Mayi sneered in the heart, in addition to Wangdu inner city, which city can put all the areas on the slate? There is such a wide The flat road surface is good enough. There are still a lot of mud in the long song fortress.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the depth of the town, she saw many houses on both sides of the road. Was demolished, there are mud houses and wooden houses. Although it is not a new house, it is far from being incapable of living. "Is this because they blocked the street and were driven away by the lord?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, they all moved to the community." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cell? Mey asked. "What is that?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brick house that everyone can get? Mayi couldn't believe her ears, which is more exaggerated than the slate floor. Does she have a concept of the cost of building such a house? It was a bad time in front of the film, and Mey had to swallow his words into his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of pedestrians on the street, and they occasionally stop and say hello to Irene and Philin. Mey found that Irene seems to be a so-called teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not going to perform a drama here?" she asked, "Why do the townspeople call you Teacher Irene?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's my job, the drama is just a part-time job, the town has no theater," Irene told the prince's summons. "Although it is an open-air show, the audience is also a civilian. But the salary is calculated according to the standard of the fortress. I think this is a good opportunity, at least to train yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yeah, I was very satisfied when I came to power." Gate and Sam nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open to civilians! Mey didn't have the strength to speak. Compared to Irene, she couldn't understand what the prince of the prince who came up with this idea was going to do. Can those who live for food every day understand the love and twists and turns in the drama? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the group came to a two-story building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the teacher building, but there are only nine teachers in Bianbu Town, so there are still a lot of rooms available, and the film has applied for the temporary stay of two houses for you. Right, during the performance, you will live here.” Irene handed out two keys, “Gat and Sam, Rorsch and Dina, oh, Miss Mey...”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will stay with you." Mey spoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am here to see the theatre's companions "How about it," she said with a smile. "After all, I have been working together in the theater for so long, and you probably won’t go back to the fortress again. I want to talk to you more. You will never dislike me?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not!" Irene held her hand happily. "I just worried that the room is too small, you are not used to living. I also have a lot of performances." I have to ask you!" After she turned her head, she said to the other four people, "Everyone put the baggage first, then go to my house and read the script together."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei climbed to the second floor and followed Irene and film into their new home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her last glimmer of hope was also shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t want to admit it, this small room does reveal a feeling of comfort and cleanliness. Tablecloths and curtains are obviously new and red. The white cotton cloth, the floor is very clean, and there is a linen carpet in the living room. There were a few strange cups on the low table in the living room, which attracted Mei’s gaze at a glance. She went up and picked up a close look, but she couldn't recognize the material at the moment—it was lighter, a bit like wood, but the surface was smooth, and the color was full and beautiful, not at all cheaper than civilians could afford. Product. The cup is also painted with a pattern, it seems that two people are intimately attached together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A very beautiful cup, right?" Irene said, "It’s too expensive, selling five silver wolves in the convenience market, four. The calculations are different, and the poses of the people in the pattern are different. Feilin said that it is to celebrate the payday, and he has to buy it and give it to me. As a result, he will use all the salary. The fool."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Convenient market?" Mey deliberately ignored the latter part of the sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well!" she nodded. "The market where the Lord of the Lord opened in the town square sells some very fine everyday items, but the price is not low. I can take you there tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei’s heart is full of mischief, everything is completely different from what she expected. She thought that as a knight who was captured and defeated without ransom, even if she was released by the lord, the days must have been very difficult. Irene didn't have any savings on weekdays, so she couldn't help him any more than to suffer with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any assistance that you give yourself at this time, for Film Hiller, can all play a role in the snow. If you can go further, persuade the local lord with his own influence and let her redeem the first knight, maybe the knight's heart can be completely reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
