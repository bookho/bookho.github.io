			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Roland looked to Garcia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elevator," the latter proudly replied, "Wait a minute, you will see it soon."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long for her to finish the sentence. The indicator light on the side of the window jumped from red to green, and then the curtain automatically rose to reveal the scene outside the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suddenly understood the reason for her mixed feelings of pride. I saw that the bus was parked on a huge iron plate, surrounded by yellow and black. The concrete stone wall of the paint is marked with five or six metal rails embedded in it, and the sound of the gear bite is constantly emitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time you drop a distance, you can see the glare of the spotlights and the huge number of signs. In just a few minutes, they have dropped more than 100 meters. And the numbers are still growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the orange warning light that keeps rotating on the outer edge of the iron plate, this scene is like a lens in a science fiction movie, and also in the underground, he suddenly feels that he is building The third side of the city is eclipsed. Compared to this high entry mode, the city of the underground, which is towed by the hemp rope and the steam engine, is almost no different from the urban-rural junction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organization of the association that can make such a facility has risen several times in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no strong economic and political strength as the basis, it is absolutely impossible to achieve such a grand project with a single martial arts family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that Garcia will be proud of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the horrible wild awakened people were shocked by this scene, and there was a lot of discussion in the car. Everyone couldn’t help but look out the window and seemed to think Let's explore how deep this place is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good downside, Roland thought, before closing the curtains probably did not want the newcomers to know the specific location of the headquarters, and after entering the underground, there would be no fear, Rather than letting everyone appreciate this spectacular project, it is better to show the power of the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if the spirit behind can find an opportunity to sneak in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the number became 235, the iron plate finally stopped falling, and several passages appeared on the wall. The bus started again and drove in. One of the tunnels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was only a short distance and it was at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland followed Garcia and got off the bus, only to find that it was a very wide underground square with dense lights on its head, and its brightness was almost similar to that of white. If it weren't for the previous experience, he could hardly believe that he was in the deep underground. A statue stands in the middle of the square, and it looks like a big hand holding an irregular polyhedron. There are still several buses parked next to the statue. It seems that they are not the only newcomers to come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who are those from other cities?" Roland pointed to the crowd around the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia nodded. "There are countless branches in the association, but there are only two headquarters. If you want to get close contact with erosion, you must go to these two. place to go. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; he was slightly surprised a moment," the erosion of the outside world ...... can directly see "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;? & nbsp; & nbsp ;&nbsp; "Not only can you see it, you can also touch it - although you will never want to touch it," Garcia gave him a blank look. "Do you think we are a cult organization that draws a big pie and makes people die?" From time to time to recruit newbies, to take you to see the real crisis facing the world, is the original intention of visiting the headquarters. Some things do not see you, you will not believe - the disaster is close at hand." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the lights on the top of the head suddenly darkened, and the darkness rushed from all directions, concentrating people’s horizons into a narrow area in the center of the square. As the stage of the curtain opened, two bright beams of light sprinkled from the dome and fell on the statue. Another road is mapping out the figure of a woman in black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stands on the high platform on the side of the square, about 30 years old, wearing a classical martial arts suit, black long hair bundled on the head, one eye It seems to have suffered an old injury and is blocked by the blindfold. Although the natural power of the dream world is not limited to men and women, but there is no magic effect to improve the appearance of the body. In terms of appearance, she is no different from ordinary people, and her head is not high, but her body is more solemn and solemn. The momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
