			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the office, she saw Roland Wimbledon again, he was burying his head and writing something, probably dealing with government affairs. At this time the sun is already slanting westward, and the sky is stained with a touch of gold. Afterglow, through the floor-to-ceiling windows, left a long shadow at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the prince put down the quill, the ashes said: "I won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, you won." The other party nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a refreshing attitude made her a little surprised, I thought Roland would have to argue, but he did not expect him to approve the result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I admit that you have the ability to fight against God's fines." She said, "God's penalty is not invulnerable, their strength and body are close to me, but Lack of consciousness and thinking ability - this is also the reason why I can cope with three at the same time. If the opponent's opponent is a god penalty, I think they will only rush from the front. So the gods can not be judged like a trial. The army sent it alone. If I didn't guess wrong, the church needs to send someone to lead them to fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Roland smiled. "This information is very important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the new weapon in the Cavaliers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Firearms," ​​he said. "In the future, my soldiers will use this weapon. Even an unarmed farmer can defeat a well-trained trial army with a musket."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes hesitated, "Can you give me a musket?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unless you join the Witch Alliance," Roland said, " After all, this kind of thing is still very rare at the moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rejection of the other party is expected, she exhaled, "I must meet with Tilly as soon as possible, Tomorrow morning, I will leave Bianbu Town. If you can't keep up, you can move to the fjord to take refuge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, "You are the same, Don't forget to tell this news to my dear sister, there is also a place for the witch to be in the west of the Grey Fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Ashes silent for a moment, "I will consider."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she was about to leave the office, the prince stopped her. "Wait, I have a gift to send." For you, just behind the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gift? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She groaned and turned back, only to see a huge long sword placed on the door - because it was blocked by the door, she did not come in when she came in Notice it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your sword can't be used anymore. I asked Anna to cut it for you. This is not a bad quality iron sword, but pure steel. Indeed, "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, it is evenly uniform, reflecting the metallic red luster in the setting sun. She stepped forward and gently stroked the big sword. It can be seen that the thickness of the blade is very uniform, and there is still a trace of quenching on the side of the blade. This is undoubtedly a weapon of excellent quality. The only thing that puzzles the ashes is its shape. Compared to the double-edged sword, it has only one side with a blade, the other side has a small thumb width, no sword tip, and the head is trapezoidal. The most peculiar thing is that in front of the blade, in addition to engraving a strange pattern, the unbladed side has a round bulge and is painted in gold, which is very eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she didn’t want to admit her love, she couldn’t help but push her up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why does it look like this... strange?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because this is not ordinary Weapons," Roland laughed. "It's called the Ashbringer. It's a legendary item compared to your previous whiteboard sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "..." Ashes decided not to delve into the inexplicable vocabulary of the other party. "In this case, I accepted it. As a gift, I will also give you a gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not answer and left the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Early the next morning, Roland opened the door and saw a fish sitting at the desk at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two people are gone?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," she replied lazily. "When the sky was just on the road, Wendy went to give her a ride."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but feel that Wendy was full of concern for any sister, not to mention the witch who had protected her from infringement and indirectly helped her escape from the monastery. He thought that Wendy would follow the ashes, but did not expect her to first reject the invitation of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the Witch Alliance is still twelve, which makes Roland's body full of energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think they will tell the news here to the witches on the other side of the sea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Maybe, maybe not," he leaned back in his chair and sighed. "But when they encounter difficulties that cannot be solved, they always think of Bianbu Town."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close your eyes, and Roland looks at the memories of the four princes in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly is not close to him, or she is keeping a certain distance from everyone, even Wimbledon III is no exception. In addition to her good looks and her talents from an early age, she did not leave much information about her in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the five kings began to secretly cover the witches, and when they planned to go to the fjord development, Roland did not know. But no matter what, she is a natural ally that she can fight for. After all, confronting the church is the common goal of the two at this stage. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for sending Taza to spread the gossip, it’s not in vain. The witch’s awakening is a random event. It’s impossible for Tilly to take away all the witches, especially after the organization’s evacuation. The newly awakened witch will be more eager to find a place to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you know the intelligence of the Prisoners, what he will do next is undoubtedly to expand the production scale of the diacid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More efficient gunpowder and explosives are inseparable from nitric acid and sulfuric acid. After the first army replaced the revolver rifle, the barrel with the twisted line was matched with the fixed bullet. The accuracy of the shots will increase dramatically, so the meaning of training becomes even more important – in the age of no barrage suppression, the superb veterans of the shooting are topped with ten freshly shot new recruits. The bullets that you must consume at the time will be an amazing number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And black powder will remain in the barrel, block the twist line, reduce the life of the barrel, only the use of smokeless gunpowder can solve this problem. The early smokeless gunpowder was actually a nitrocellulose, and later it was a mixture of **** and nitrocellulose. Nowadays, the nitric acid used to soak the sealing sponge is quite inadequate, not to mention replacing all the ** into fire wool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laboratory method can only be produced on a small scale. If you want to meet the needs of an army, industrial production methods are a must. Unfortunately, in the face of a completely unfamiliar chemical industry, Roland could not think of any good solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, education can't be put down. Not only the popularization of primary cultural knowledge, but also the transformation of ideas needs to be implemented as soon as possible. The aborigines have withstood the test of the demon moon, and with the propaganda of the First Army, they have a higher recognition of the witch group, but the outsiders still accept the concept of church indoctrination. Nowadays, the number of migrants in Bianbu Town has soared, especially the serfs. They are still living in the wooden sheds along the Chishui River. They are regarded as the "outer city" of the town. Once they are promoted to the free people, they will gradually move into the city. It would be too late to correct the concept at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must have to come up with a method of refining the sound and quiet, while at the same time making it easy for the general public to accept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thinking for a while, he opened his eyes and suddenly found the nightingale Looking at herself, she looked subconsciously and turned her head out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
