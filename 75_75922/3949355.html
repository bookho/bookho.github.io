			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lehman and his group rode on the streets of the Long Song Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the battle, the residents of the city hid in the house, closed the door, and the half-personal shadow on the street could not be seen, it seemed a bit deserted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Lehman, your hand is fine." "The shield" Knight Levin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is not big," Lehman Hoss shrugged. "At least it can move." But this action made his brows wrinkle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of winning the door last night went very smoothly, but the guards who stayed at the East Gate of the fortress were only twenty people, and never imagined that the enemy would attack from the city. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the horn was blown, the reinforcements arrived at least a quarter of an hour, and fifteen mercenaries who took the pills rushed to the city and killed the guards. Dead, Lehman led the Cavaliers to open the gate. In the dark, he did not notice that there was a side door on the side of the wall, and there were two guards in the cold, and one of them rushed to him with a hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to facilitate the rotation of the winch, his weapon has been collected at the waist, under the rush, Lehman had to use his arm to resist, almost at the same time, Levin on the other side Delivered a long sword and stabbed straight into the guard's waist. Affected by this fatal blow, the falling hammer lost more than half of its strength, but still left a dent on his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Lehman didn’t feel much pain. After he took the gate, he realized that his right arm was difficult to lift, and he untied his arm. The swelling is the same as the rolling pin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope there are herbs in the church that can be analgesic," Levin said. "They often prepare some weird things."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, meatballs." Another knight, Dorn, came up with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteen knights lost two people in the night attack, one was seriously injured, and now lying in the camp, it is estimated that it will be tonight. In general, such losses are acceptable, Lehman thought. Now that the militia units have entered the city, the fortress is completely in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, a group of people came to the church door, a group of more than 100 people militia have been waiting here, seeing Lehman, have a look of desire Look like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put the pills to them," Lehman rolled over and saw that everyone had taken the ball before they led the team to the ladder and walked to the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Standing," the two goalkeepers shouted, "The Holy Land, you must not wear weapons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Levin pulled out the weapon and handed it over. "Know it, will this be for you?" Just as the believer reached out and prepared to take the sword, he suddenly grasped the hilt with one hand and slammed up. Pick, the other hand's two hands will fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah--" The scream of the believer has not yet emerged from his throat, and the knight has pierced the tip of his sword into his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levin’s nickname is a strong shield, but the first-hand fast sword is a rival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another believer was also cut off by Doan, and Lehman kicked the door open and walked into the hall without expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" A middle-aged man in a blue-breasted priest's robe greeted him, facing the bloody blade without fear. "Don't dare to break into the church! Children, grab them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lehman sneer, most of the townspeople are now at home, resident churches The believers are only twenty or thirty. In the face of the knights who have fought in battle, the rebels have only one dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he ordered, Dorn had already smirked and pulled the sword to cut a rushing believer. Others soon joined the battle, and the church suddenly became chaotic. Make a group. When the situation was not good, the priest shouted, "Children, take the holy medicine and let the gods give you the power to defeat the mob!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, Lehman’s heart is happy, and there are pills! I saw that the eyes of the believers suddenly became red, and the face was covered with blue veins. During the period of efficacy, an ordinary person can explode the strength and speed beyond the limits of the human body. The narrower the terrain, the harder it is to cope. It is a pity that it is not only you who have such a thing, he thinks, taste your own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
