			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbad is riding a basket and slowly rising from the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you feel?" Just taking off his heavy helmet, Molly greeted her. "Is the world under the water interesting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not much better than the desert. Although there are many strange animals and plants, it’s not as good as nothing. Every time I sink into the sea, there is always a feeling of being swallowed up. The ubiquitous pressure is hard to walk, and even breathing is difficult. Although Simbadi thinks so, he can see the look of Molly, he I swallowed it again. "How do you say... the scenery is pretty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s good...if I can go down Look at it." Molly exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at her big brown eyes, Simbadi suddenly remembered that a year and a half ago, the tribe started from Bishui Port and went to the southern end of the desert. In the stone boat is also such a look - the road is uncertain, the environment is unfamiliar, she can also give up the spirit to comfort themselves, in a group of restless people, it is just like a heterogeneous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, there is a trace of uneasiness in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job, your performance surprised me." Rex was then lifted out of the water, and he slammed the basket down. “Balancing, gassing, calming, and sense of direction – all the qualities needed for diving are so good. Is this the natural talent of the sand people, or are you good at it? I have no intention to offend, and Mu When Miss Li chatted, she mentioned that you are not a strong warrior in the clan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murray spit out his tongue and turned around I ran to chat with my assistant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a pool of water in the oasis of the fish bone clan life. When you were young, everyone liked to dive deeper than anyone else, so it is not inexperienced..." Simbadi reluctantly said, "But she is right. Even if it is more than this, I am not the most powerful one in the family. If you let Carlon try it, maybe one day is enough."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Caron? Who is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The strongest younger generation in the family, whether it is hunting Still fighting, not inferior to the big clan's peers. But he only participated in a dispatch team, now should work in the clear water port ... you are too late to find him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Rex shrugged. "I don't think so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is stronger than you." The fjords took off their diving suits a little bit. "If you want to go deep into the sea, technology is not the first." First to some, is an open heart "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;".? ...... open heart "Zimbardi startled Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Accepting the unknown and overcoming the self, this is also the gap between the water pool and the sea." He looked in the direction of Daqing Port. "There is an incredible change here, you The car boy who said that he only wanted to come here once, at this point, he is far worse than you. If I am looking for him, it is estimated that he may not be able to convince him to put on the diving suit." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddi gave him a blank look. "If it’s not for Murray, I want to try it myself, I won’t promise you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to take them to the water hole and took ten golden dragons and left. As for this group of people who want to toss, they are casual, but did not expect that Murray is already there. The strange device has a strong interest. When she learned that she needed a helper for the salvage work, she raised her hand almost immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Sinbad had to promise to help the odds in the end, and personally follow Rex into the water hole - before verifying that the diving suit is safe. He simply did not trust Mu Li to test his life, let alone stay with a fjord. Although she knows that she will still have the day to go into the water, at least the risk is much smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha," Rex laughed disapprovingly. "But you have crossed this line and are taking a new field." One step, isn't it? Perhaps it is because of this that Molly prefers to get along with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, you didn't find it?" He said, "When the girl chats with me, your name appears to be not as high as usual. She said that when you were young, you were too courageous, and you were often crying and crying. Curiosity is not small, but it has converged a lot after growing up, and it has become much silent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbad has pulled a slap, " She is really...whatever I say to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s easier to say that outsiders are easier to say," Rex grinned. "I don't I understand the customs of the sand people too - perhaps personal force is really important, but you may have been ignoring yourself for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know nothing , Simbadi snorted low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he said this, he didn’t have much disgust in his heart—in fact, even he felt incredible. In just a few days, he would have a gorge. The Bayers became so familiar, and at the beginning it was clear that they were not willing to stay and help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking carefully, Simbadi found that there was no contempt in the other’s words and demeanor, and there was an unexpected sense of ease when compared to those who were self-esteemed. North aristocrats or fjord businessmen, this can be said to be very unusual. Probably also for this reason, Molly will run to the Wonder Club camp when she has time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hesitating for a moment, he raised this question with Rex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You ask why..." The latter thought for a moment, "There is no special reason, because we have already tasted enough. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taste... enough? Simbadi can't help but swear, and can make 30 gold dragons' remuneration in one go. How do you see a lot of personal status? Where does contempt come from? Just waiting for him to continue to ask, an assistant has come over. "Teacher, the equipment has been fully commissioned, and the official dive can start at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How?" Rex looked at him. "Dive for you, shouldn't it be strange?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had to suppress his heart Doubt, "As long as you create these things, there is no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I have studied for almost ten years, in order to ensure foolproof, almost all of my family I have invested in this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啥?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough cough - - No, nothing, don't care," Rex yelled. "If that's the case, then I'm going to enter the water hole after noon and start my first adventure!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for choosing noon is very simple. Since the gas pipe can meet the depth requirement, ensuring a good view becomes a top priority for diving.At this time, the sun is just at the top of the cliff, almost directly to the sea, and the seabed more than 50 meters deep can be seen at a glance, not to mention the water hole located on the half of the rock wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wait until the evening to retreat, you will lose your way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am waiting for you at the entrance," Rex wore a helmet and got a thumbs up. He first sank into the sea in a hanging basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, the assistant’s blindfold nodded to Simbadi. “It’s yours.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sinbaddi took a deep breath and put a heavy helmet on the top of his head. Muli stepped forward to help him tighten the interface, and then put it on the face of the helmet. "Come on, I am here waiting for you to come back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave her a deep look and turned to the gondola. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the roar of the steam engine, Simbadi fell a little bit, and the blue sea surface that was rushing with the waves was getting closer and closer to him, gradually occupying the entire field of vision. For a moment, he produced the illusion that he was not falling, but the sea took the initiative to meet him and wanted to swallow him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A familiar fear reappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
