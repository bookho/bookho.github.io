			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lightning strike detected a large group of people from the North Gate of the Dragon Ridge, the pedestrian had been on the mountain for a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the church messenger is similar to that expected at the beginning of the nightingale. The trial warrior in armor is at the forefront of the team, totaling 25, followed by long The long squad, watching the dress is roughly composed of believers and mercenaries, the total number is about 100. Except for the trial army riding a horse, everyone else is walking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two carriages in the messenger group, and the Holy Ghost is undoubtedly on one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five people sneaked in the direction of Chishui City after quietly following the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan, when the enemy team left the surveillance area of ​​the Longling Ridge, and could not get support quickly, it was their moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale is in the fog, quietly watching the four-wheeled carriage in the middle of the team, through the twisted carriage outline, you can see the magic of silver It is looming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she is alone, she may be able to find a chance to kill the church ambassador, but there is no guarantee that everyone will be buried here, and now there is a sleeping island witch With the assistance, the possibility of blocking this news in the south is much higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once these people have lost their tracks, wait until Hermes responds, at least for the coming spring. And even if they want to find out the mystery of the disappearance of the messenger, it is very difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night does not like killing, but this time she took the initiative to decide to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to relieve the burden of the Highness, in order to make the sacred mountain of the witch last. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not regret becoming a sharp knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the messenger group entered a piece of woodland, the nightingale saw the sky far away And near black shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 gathered his wings and roared and swooped down. The horse suddenly screamed in horror and fled uncontrollably. The people who witnessed this scene were scared. I was so stunned that I was at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible behemoth did not rush into the crowd to bite and trample as they imagined, but spread its wings as it was about to land, passing over the head of the team. The wind pressure caused by the crowd made everyone almost unable to open their eyes. One person jumped from the back of the giant beast and fell straight to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enemy!" The messenger screamed at the trial of the warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The believers pulled out their weapons as if they were awake, and chopped at the strange enemy in the center of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the black and white sight of the nightingale, a group of dark black holes wrapped the other side tightly, and the ordinary witch did not have the power to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the opponent they met was the superb, ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sword light flashed, and the believers close to her were cut off, like the harvested wheat, and suddenly fell down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not use the iconic epee, but an ordinary one-handed iron sword, so that the sable can carry her while Carry a witch more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron sword broke and broke quickly in the slash, but there are still many scattered soldiers around it for her to pick up - whether it is a long scorpion, a stick, a hammer Still a machete, a deadly weapon in her hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood is splashing, the limbs are scattered, and the ash is cutting off the team by one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenaries in the rear are also unable to support, they find themselves in another dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia’s figure is like a fairy who dances in the woods. She uses the trunk and branches as a hidden object to constantly change her position. Use each slot to shoot the arrow. Every time someone shot, he was in the middle of his eyebrows and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
