			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new administrative system, the news that the king is about to be crowned soon spread from west to north, and caused an uproar in various places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, unlike the merchants and the boatman, the local city halls posted announcements in the most prominent locations in the town, and arranged to understand the lecturers. Intention to let the civilians understand the decision of the royal family in general. Under the official attitude, the heat of the matter swept through the streets of the city in just a few days. No matter where you went, you could hear relevant discussions, as if the cold of the winter had faded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Wangdu’s “ground trumpeter” is no exception. After all, the pub is always the gathering place for popular news, sitting on the stove and drinking a glass of ale, 嗑The rumors that I don’t know where to hear are one of the few entertainment methods for civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the new owner of the trumpeter, the black hammer smiled almost in the past few days. After the winter, the pub's business was much deserted, and after the news of the throne, it resumed the excitement of the past, and the income seemed to rise, and his mood also rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that this discussion will continue until the official completion of the coronation and the dust settles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deciding to be enthroned in the evil month is a very wise decision. If you can see your Majesty, he will definitely hesitate to bow down and kiss him devoutly. The tip of the boot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing in this world that is more lovely than Golden Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as their former mouse, the possibility of being allowed to approach Roland Wimbledon is negligible, and it’s good to see Tasda adults. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black hammer is somewhat self-aware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that today’s Tasaki is not the squad leader of the past, or the nameless guard of the Four Princes, after the failure of Fei Ke’s defeat of the king, He has already faintly noticed the first person of the old king. In the past, even the tavern owner Najib, who did not give the mouse a single eye, was sent to a remote place by a word. After the black street clean-up operation that was carried out, they also got rid of the cloak of their fingers because of Tassa’s mentioning point. They turned into a formal lord and took over the underground trumpeter pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This promotion is not a black hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intends to take a silver ring, a clay pot, a little finger and go to the door before the other party leaves the old king, even though it will take an extra Golden Dragon, but as long as he maintains this relationship, he will earn back sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, he has not forgotten what he should do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to collect intelligence for the adults of Tassa - whether it is the bragging of the sellers, or the traveler’s way of seeing, as long as there is something of interest to adults, he All must be recorded and reported to the connector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, obviously the most important thing to watch out for is the potential rebel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, guests on the 6th table -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't think this fact is too much Coincidence?" A red-faced merchant shouted, "There is no such thing as a rush to the throne. His Majesty just announced that he would marry an infertile witch, and he just got the remains of the great prince. The news of a child, how to look at it is unreasonable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been echoed by some people, "I heard that His Royal Highness is not good at all. Even some people have told him that he is infected with a young knight. How come suddenly an unmarried wife emerges?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not a king, it is not clear, compared to the two princes and the four princes, but even the banquet is rarely attended, this is still not wrong." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you think about it," the businessman said again. "Your Majesty only said that he would recall the two people back to the city without a winter, but he did not know the identity of the posthumous child. Didn't deliberately leave a controversy, focus everyone's attention on inheritance qualifications? Which family does the woman come from, and whether the child born has the blood of the Wimbledon family? These are enough for a few years, but they are really terrible. Nothing is concerned about things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the real thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the witch!" He gave himself a swig of wine. "They secretly controlled their squats and made them. The so-called wills and children are to distract our attention and realize the trick of controlling the gray castle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience is in awe, "Witches can make people Come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I told you that there is nothing they can't make!" the merchant yelled, "The stones floating on the water will do, let alone One person? It’s because these monsters are rampant, no one is coming to rent my boat now! Of course, now I want to create a flawless person who can’t do it, so the witch needs time to wait until they are completely successful. That child will naturally not need it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha...I see you are out of heart, do you think that there is only a majesty in the palace? One person, there is only one stone of punishment around him?" Everyone suddenly laughed, in the pub When filled with a happy atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You-嗝--Although laughing, the miners in Silverlight City have been replaced by the things that witches make, and all the rivers run are The stone boat in the winter city, when it is your turn, I can see if you can still laugh!" The businessman said with a big tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔, although the intelligence value is not high, but the heart is counter-intuitive, it is also a rebellion... The black hammer lifts the carbon pen and twists on a piece of paper. Write down the characteristics of the other party, as well as the words "destroy the royal family, malicious to the witch", stuffed into the inconspicuous sew of the wine cabinet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, the police will respond quickly, and when the businessman goes out, it is estimated that he will be caught. As for whether the other party has the opposite, it is the task of the interrogator, and has nothing to do with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Inner City Earl's Court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is this dress?" Joel put a high-necked dress made of good fabric on the chest, "Will it be?" It seems too strong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondent was a business woman he met in the morning, Danny Payton. She leaned back on the bed and pulled the half of the quilt to cover the chest. "I didn't see you so aggressively when I was dating. I didn't even receive the invitation. I just heard the news." Are you ready to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland and I have been friends for more than ten years. What kind of invitation is needed for this kind of friendship, it is for outsiders. "The thing is shaking." "You haven’t answered my question yet. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be honest, you Everything is almost the same," Dennis yawned. "It doesn't look like you anyway. But if you want to go without winter, what should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," he hesitated. "If you want to have fun, I might be able to introduce you to a few good ones..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No interest," Dennis said bluntly. "I prefer the target I chose. Besides, I am looking for you from the Glory City. Is your hospitality?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the self-knowledge, he sighed, "What about you?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businesswoman raised her lips and said, "Take me to go without winter. I have long wanted to see what the king who had stirred up the morning smashing looks like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since being an old friend for more than a decade, Your Majesty will definitely invite you to his dinner party. "Dennis opened the quilt, rolled over and got out of bed, step by step to the front of the cousin. "You can just bring me in the form of a partner. When I was in Huiguang City, I attended with you so much." At the banquet, do you have to satisfy my little wish this time?" She said that she was holding her neck and putting her lips to his ear. "Reassured, I know that you have someone you really want to see... I am not only I won't interfere with you, maybe I will help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
