			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fortress, the inner city garden mansion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the scheduled information exchange day, Tassa is sitting on a soft chair in the living room, waiting for the arrival of the "Dove and Hat" Acrobatic Troupe. After the fall, the closing time of the inner gate was advanced to the evening, and the secret gathering had to be changed to the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to arrive in a mansion is always Hill Fox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wore a blue velvet open-collar jacket, light gray leggings and moccasin boots, and a white bow tie at the neck. Live off a noble dress. After the ceremony, he handed over the "Kingdom of the Kingdom", which was sandwiched under His Majesty, to Tassa. The latter took the book and glanced at him with interest. "Read it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Hill nodded, then hesitated. "You don't teach me some fighting skills... or assassination skills?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the evil broke out, you said that I would train me to be a qualified intelligence officer," he scratched his head. "But so far, you have only given me some bizarre books to read."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean "The History of Customs"?" Tassa gave himself I poured a glass of wine and threw two ice cubes. "This is not a bizarre book. It records the origins, traditions, family emblems, and specialties of the nobility in the kingdom. As an intelligence collector, you must first see A lot of knowledge, in order to roughly determine whether there is any value from the news from all over. As for swordsmanship and assassination?" He smiled. "I didn't intend to let you." If you rush into an organization or go deep into the enemy to probe the news, it is dangerous and time-consuming and laborious. If you have this effort, you might as well spend more money to buy the insider directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But not everyone can be bought," Hill insisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And those organizations that don't leak water are also difficult to insert into their eyes. It's not a dozen or twenty years of effort, and it's unlikely to sneak into it." Sa shook the cup and drank the ice wine. "Qualified intelligence personnel can only do two things: identify the message and hide itself. The books I give you are the basis for distinguishing the message. As for the second point... as You should be more experienced than me in the Acrobatic Troupe. For example, your dress today is very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." is in Hill. When Fox bowed his head and thought about the meaning of the words, the clowns and others also rushed to this remote house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults, people are all there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If so, then we will start "Tasa puts down the wine glass and spreads out the notepad. "Who is coming first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will talk first, adults," the most burly rock mountain An open channel, "The camp in the outskirts of Wangdu East District has also entered a group of new people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news made the brows jump slightly, did not expect to listen The first information I arrived was not good news. Since the loss of the Knights of the Kings, the barracks set up in the suburbs have become the station of the militia. Rats, fugitives and criminals recruited by Tiefko will be inserted into Dongying before the expedition. More than a month ago, a group of more than a thousand militiamen had just been sent to the west. Now, there are new people added? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are only two or three hundred people, most of which seem to be from There are some blood-sailing mice in addition to the Northland, but there are not many rats that are willing to go to the first two times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Closely monitor their movements. Every time you add more than 200 people to the camp, you must report it to me," Tassa said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people have only one use, that is, after taking the pills Used as a consumable. Now the Queen of the Waters is north, there is no resistance in the south, and Tefco will undoubtedly continue to attack the territory of His Royal Highness. He must pass this news back to Bianbu Town as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next clown brings you confidential information, or talk about drinking," the clown said in an exaggerated tone, "I can't verify this message." True or false, but listening to the group of businessmen who have a nose and face, it is true. They said that the black sailing team of Garcia Wimbledon appeared in the kingdom of the winter and launched an attack on the church. The siege of Wolf Heart City was also disintegrated. They were also prepared to take some of the scarce goods in the past before the winter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
