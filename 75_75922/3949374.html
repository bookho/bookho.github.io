			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Tsar to a small house on the second floor of the pub, the strong man told the drinker to continue cleaning, and then closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a place to entertain customers with special needs, only 25 copper eagle in one night, so the environment is not elegant. There was an unpleasant musty smell on the small bed, and it was crumpled, as if it had not been taken out for a long time. The cracked wooden table was missing a corner, the crack was filled with black flocs, and the table looked greasy and dirty. However, Tassa was too lazy to care about. He sat down on the bed and waited quietly for the other party to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been a long time gone," said the strong man. "Since Najib has replaced your seat, how can you not even come to the pub? Even if you don't If you are responsible for this, you can also have a drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His nickname is Black Hammer, the caretaker of the " Underground Trumpeter" pub, licking his fingers member. It sounds scary, but it is one of the many mice in the black street of Wangdu. The mice pulled out the gangs and divided the sites, forming a large and loose organization according to the different business operations. Behind these underground organizations, there are more or less shadows of big nobility or wealthy businessmen, and the fingers are no exception. But unlike domestic dogs, most mice don't choose to be loyal to someone. They can do things for anyone as long as they have the benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no nonsense," Tassa said bluntly. "At night, you call Hillway, piglet, silver ring, and clay pot. It’s here. In the pub, I have something to arrange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are all underground trumpeters," the black hammer smashed, "Light them." Enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, this is a good business." He shrugged. "Look at what you have done for me." I only want to find you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the usual steps of dealing with Black Street, you must first find the connector person, and then the other party judges whether to take the task. After the two agree, the joint person will delegate the task to the right person and charge the fee. Of course, this process is not guaranteed by any contract or written proof, and it is completely unknown whether it can achieve the effect expected by the employer. Generally speaking, the more well-known organizations care about their own credibility, the commission fees are also high, and the new organization fees are low, but it is easy to get the world. These mice and the city patrol formed a delicate balance that together maintained the order of the king's surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the palace to become a court ban, Tassa served on the patrol and was responsible for handing over some inconvenient things to the organizations of the Black Street. deal with. Therefore, Wang Duo’s most powerful group of mice is clear and he has saved the time of dealing with joint people. The reason for choosing your fingers is simply because they are not so bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can ask, who are you doing for now?" Black Hammer hesitated for a moment and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa did not answer, but extended his thumb and pointed the direction behind the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol or the mouse, most people only know that he became a Guard, but I don’t know how long it took him to be selected by Wimbledon III. The prince’s guards went to the border town with the Prince’s house. In the six months that disappeared, they should think that they have been in the court. Besides, I am only pointing to the direction of the palace, not lying - the royal family is not only one of the Feike, Roland Wimbledon is also a member of the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand," he nodded. "But Hilly and the piglet are gone. Can I pick my own hand?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dead." Black Hammer hates, "Last winter and The people in Dreamland had a conflict. They sold poppies and long-necked ferns to the Beicheng District. Casas led everyone to drive them back. Hilli’s neck was scratched, and the blood could not stop. They were filled in the canal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa frowned, this kind of patrol did not care, even deliberately provoked the mouse They bite each other in order to control their strength and quantity. As for the dead, no one cares. "That's fine, but you have to remember that you must be someone in the pub."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
