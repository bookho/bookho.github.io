			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nightfall, Wendy came to the door of the bedroom of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached out and was hesitating whether the door should be opened, the door was opened behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I knew you would come to me," the other smiled. "Because I want to talk to you too - just like in the past." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book apparently washed the bath early, and the wet long hair did not rise as usual, but sprinkled freely on the shoulders. In order to prevent the wet robe, she also put a towel on her shoulder. The tip of the hair covered her forehead, and also blocked the wrinkles left by those years, plus the increasingly comfortable life, so that her skin is full and rich, at first glance, as if younger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that hasn’t changed is her wise eyes that belong to the elderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty couldn’t help but raise his mouth. "In your room, is it mine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Your, the nightingale will come back later than the leaves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Chaotic drinks are from you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诶!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course Who will first ask who is responsible for the drinks, the old rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you will wait for me at the door?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, patience is a very important thing, this is one of my life experiences, now you have learned?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Okay..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two returned to the bedroom, cleaned the desk, Wendy took two cups and a bottle of chaotic drink from the drawer, The cup is full. The orange-red liquid reflects the luster like a flame under the magic stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you get this?" The book sipped a little. "The luck is really good. It is no worse than the dragon liquor in winter." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you earned it," Wendy said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t say that we are all the blessings of Miss Toveline."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For This kind of varied drink, the way it is distributed to the members of the Witch Alliance is also very interesting. Every month, everyone has the opportunity to take a bottle from the chaotic drink made by Evelyn - because the answer can only be seen before it is revealed. By number, no one knows which kind of drink they will receive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, after the exchange, or eating and drinking, it will become an important part of the day. I don’t know why, McMug always gets the most popular drinks. For everyone to think that Evelyn leaked to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two slowly tasted the warm, hearty red sweet drink while listening to the cold wind whistling outside the window. Compared to the room filled with heating, this feeling will undoubtedly make people feel intoxicated. They rarely speak, sometimes they look at each other and understand the thoughts in each other's hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Wendy has no specific words to say, she is only sincerely happy. By closing her eyes now, the words of Roland Wimbledon will appear in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The leader will only have one person, that is me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, she Although he feels that his Majesty is extremely approachable, he is also worried that he will hesitate on some key issues or show weaknesses that are not suitable for the King. It seems that he is even better than he expected, and from the tone and look of his negotiations, the experience of these two years has made him more stable and has a momentum of speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes Wendy even more incredible is that although Roland is more mature in the position of the superior, the attitude towards the witch and the ordinary people remains the same. It is like that is his instinct. Compared with the former, this is the most incredible point, especially for a royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
