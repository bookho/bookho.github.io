			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the wind and snow, Ajima once again stepped into the winter without the castle area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although calling her after the night is a bit unusual, but with the trust of Wendy, she agreed to the trip and would like to go all the way. Doris stayed in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of an accident... at least it will not affect her partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing outside the gate of the castle, Achima could not help but tighten the collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cold?" Wendy glanced at her with a smile. "Reassured, you will soon take it off when you get in."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to talk about it -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come, Wendy. Just as she was in doubt, the door suddenly opened to the sides slowly. After the guards saluted the two men, they made a gesture of asking. "You are in the study at the moment, I still have the responsibility, I don’t bring You went up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Working hard," Wendy nodded, pulling Achima's hand and taking her into the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, a warm breeze dispels all the cold and wraps her around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original...this is the heating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she knows that such high-quality heating equipment is available in high-end homes, it can be kept warm without an open fire, but when it comes to real experience, it still feels a bit shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attendants who walked back and forth in the castle wore nice and light summer dresses, singles and long skirts everywhere, and in the corner of the restaurant, no girls or even shoes. Running barefoot on the carpet. Compared to the situation in the fall, it is now more like summer, which makes her doubt again about her own guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really wants to enjoy, only to build a winter city here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Wendy has taken off her coat and blinked at her. "If you don’t take it off, you will sweat soon. If you go out again, you will be troubled by the cold wind. If you accidentally get cold, you will be in trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I know."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achima somewhat stiffly untied the clothes, and involuntarily looked into the other's chest - although her is not too small, in front of Wendy, there is still a comparison Big gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you really have that kind of idea... How can you find yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a self-deprecating thought, she walked up the third floor with Wendy and entered the lord's study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, Akima is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honor to you, kneel down." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akima bent down and used the light to sweep through the people in the room, and finally fell on a gray-haired man behind the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite is the king of the Grey Fort, she realized that she had only seen him from the banquet when she had not left the sleeping spell. Now, the first close observation, the first feeling in the mind is: the king of the gray castle is too young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the age of thirty, they defeated other brothers and sisters, defeated the church, and directly and neatly collected all the kingdom territories. This is really his age. Can you get it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can openly disagree with Tilly, but she can’t take the same attitude to deal with each other - once she leaves the Winter City, the Sleeping Curse will no longer be with them. Gua Ge, unless you escape from the Grey Fort, otherwise it will be controlled by this man in any part of the kingdom. Even if she is not afraid of authority, she can't help but think of Doris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Ajima looked up a little surprised. "You mean, you want to recruit me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it seems to be a special offer - For jobs that require abilities, the price of the Witch Alliance is often higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the timing he said... What does it mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, a fixed contract, the rewards are also very impressive," Roland raised a cup and took a drink, "two gold dragons a month, until you finish The task, after the event, rewards 50. How do you feel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akima couldn’t help but jump, not to mention the reward, just every The salary of the two Golden Dragons in the month has been equal to the subsidy of the Sleeping Curse. If she has this income, she can not only solve the cost of living independently, but also help her partner in turn! As for the tail of the 50 Golden Dragons, whether it is to leave the capital, or to find the pears of their loved ones, they buy a bigger home, which is a good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This recruitment is really coming in time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the long-term wandering career also made her clear that there was never a pancake in the world, and the bait was used as a bait to attract people into the trap, even more noble. Their tricks. Even if the other party is the ruler of this kingdom, you can't relax your vigilance. "The reward is really impressive, but I have to know first, you can let me give you a reply if you want me to do something."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ability is most practical in the wilderness, looking for water, animal nests and fruits are all good things, but no winter city is not like the lack of these things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple, help me find a stone," Roland pulled out a box from the drawer and opened it on the table. "This is for you, It should not be a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can I see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akima stepped forward and pinched the contents of the box in the palm of his hand - it was almost the size of a thumb, flaky, smooth and cold, obviously It has been carefully polished, not so much a stone, but rather a special coin. In addition, it is gray-black in the whole body, and there is no color at all. It is hard to imagine that this thing will cause interest in your majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hesitated, "If it’s just a stone, I’m afraid it’s hard to find the source you want. When I was sleeping on the island, there was a chamber of commerce that commissioned me to find a gem. The source, but my ability has led them to the Glowing Islands - there is nothing but dry hot stone. For this reason, the sleeping spell also pays a sea fee."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess those should be rammed, and in terms of composition, it is indeed the source of the gems." Roland sneered with a smile, "As for whether you can find What I want, I can try it now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blacks and gems are the same thing? Ajima suppressed the doubts in her heart, and exerted her ability to show the stone in her hand. In an instant, a dazzling green light shot from her hand, almost occupying half of her field of vision! The splendour of the light is no less than the lights in the castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the king’s desk also bloomed a green light--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help Kneeling in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is only visible to herself. It not only indicates the direction of the source, but also the degree of enrichment at the source. Most of the time, it is like a firefly. In general, densely distributed around the world, according to the instructions of continuous merger, she can find the next gathering point from a gathering point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not surprising that the other person hides another part of the stone on the table. It’s just a simple test to see if her ability works. . But what surprised Achille was the intensity of the light column – which meant that the inconspicuous stone pieces in her hands, and the ones still hidden in the table, belonged to the source level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small source level, she is the first time I saw it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but...how is it possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
