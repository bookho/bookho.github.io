			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, girls, are you going to bowl fish soup?" Captain Jack headed into the cabin and tilted the pipe in his mouth. "Just had a The lucky guy caught a large scorpion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Tilly Wimbledon nodded. "We will come over soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a fish soup," the sigh sighed as the captain left. "Where is this boring thing delicious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can add more salt to the bowl," and the wind sneered. "Pepper is OK, but it's more expensive. I'm afraid Mr. Jack can't give it to you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, the soup is close to the original taste, but also the quality of the food itself," Andrea elegantly geography his own pale gold long hair "Tilly, let's go to the captain's room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as it's hot," the shortest gauzy muttered, "My toes Fast frozen "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people followed the stairs and boarded the tower from the hustle of the Beauty, Jack. One-eyed was standing by the porthole and looking behind the boat. That glimpse of the white track that spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This damn weather, how suddenly it became so cold?" He spit out a circle of smoke, "Three gods are on, now only to Zhongqiu. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably the god is asleep?" Ashes shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I can’t say this at sea," Captain Jack grinned. "Poseidon stares at us forever," he said in his chest. "Forget it, don't think about it, come to the bowl of fish soup and warm your stomach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enjoy the warm food in the captain's room, he does not hesitate A large hole was opened in the floor, and the brazier was placed in the center of the hole, surrounded by sea sand, and insulated to prevent the fire from igniting the entire vessel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pot of fish soup on the brazier is tumbling and bubbling, and the scent overflows the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six people took off their shoes and sat around the brazier, buried their feet in the warm sand, let the cold toes fully contact with the gravel, enjoy The warmth brought by the charcoal fire baking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tili took over the fish soup handed by the captain and gently blew the steaming noodle soup - unlike the milky white soup made from black-tailed fish. This bowl of soup is dark yellow, and the oil flower floats on the surface layer, reflecting the crystal luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the occasional greenness in the soup, she knew that the old captain had taken out the bottom of the box - the sea boat was sailing for several months, It is very difficult for the crew to eat fresh vegetables and fruits. These tender green shallots are obviously preserved by him. The onion notes neutralize the astringency of the fish itself. It is blended with ginger and a little ale, and the rest is full of rich and mellow taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly will slowly drink the fish soup, and when it is about to burn to the tongue, it will pause for a while and make a few breaths. Every small mouth she can clearly feel that the soup that she drank is like a warm stream, flowing down the throat to the stomach, and warming her belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chill quickly faded, and she even felt a little warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try adding some peppers," Jack pointed to the jars with seasonings next to the brazier. "The taste will be more special, and it will be especially cold, just like wine." It must be effective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the original taste is the essence of food, it must be said that these ingredients are added just right, and the taste is not bad. ," Andrea praised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you drink?" Tilly looked at the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter waved his hand, "still forget, I can’t accept the smell of sea fish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At first, Tilly couldn’t accept the habit of the fjords’ people who loved to eat fish. Any meal would have a wide variety of fish, regular roast, boiled, fried, and like fish, fish sauce, caviar. This peculiar way... But after forcing myself to eat a few times at the official banquet, she found that the taste was actually good. Once she became familiar with the smell of sea bream, it could further bring out the deliciousness of the food itself. She can try it slowly, such as dried fish, grilled cuttlefish, and even pungent food like fried fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
