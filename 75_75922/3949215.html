			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale walked slowly along the mountain path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road under her feet is not too wide, the side is a huge stone wall, the opposite is a steep mountain rock, the distance between them is about one foot wide, the middle The gully is not deep. She carefully leaned against the stone wall to avoid slipping down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up, and there was only a tiny line of light shining in the sky, like a silver wire hanging in the night sky. But she knew that it was just past noon at the moment - even during the day, she needed to raise the torch, and the light coming in through the rock wall was not enough to illuminate the road ahead. After walking for a long time, she even gave birth to the illusion that she was walking inside the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only benefit here is that despite the chilling winds in the mountains and the heavy snow, the walls of the gorge remain unaffected. Occasionally, a few snowflakes fall from the top of the head, and fall on the mountain wall or the path and quickly turn into water vapor. There is a temperature that is not commensurate with the outside world, and occasionally she can see the heat rising in the abyss under her feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is not the case, she does not dare to go to the desolate mountains alone in the demon month. The fog can hide her body, but it can't isolate the temperature. If you walk on a cold wind, it is estimated that you will die in the snow without an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t wait for a moment here because she always feels that something is watching herself in the dark, making her feel creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can, Nightingale hopes to go all the way in the fog, but her physical strength does not support her. Long-term abilities will quickly exhaust her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale lifted the torch, and the opposite mountain rock flickered. In the faint fire, she occasionally saw the shadows of different sizes on the opposite stone wall. . The nightingale knows that those are caves, because they are so deep that the light can't shine in and it looks like a group of shadows. The stone walls that are close to each other are in the same position, and there is also a corresponding deep hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds her of the rumors of the North Slope mine, which was said to have been the nest of underground monsters. There are many winding roads in all directions, all of which are carved out by monsters. of. The North Slope Mountain is just one of the corners of the desolate mountains. Will there be passages in these caves that are connected to the mines? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thought made her shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The west of the Desperate Mountains is a wild land where no one has set foot. If you can dig up countless holes in the mountains of the mountains that stretch for hundreds of miles, I am afraid that only survive. It’s only possible to get a monster in the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dare not think about it anymore, concentrate on moving on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the road ahead changed, the shoulder width of the road was divided into two, one slightly upward, and one straight down, extended to a deeper place The end quickly fell into the darkness, and no one knew where the road was finally going. Standing at the fork point, the feeling of being stared has become very strong, as if there are countless pairs of eyes in the darkness looking at myself, making her mouth dry and scalp numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night gnaws his teeth, turns on the fog, and walks up quickly. Soon, the strange feeling disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the altitude rises, the surrounding temperature gradually decreases, and the silver line at the top of the head is also wider. After half an hour, a huge cave appeared in her right front, and the lower edge of the hole was slightly higher than the road. She lifted her leg into the hole and could see the fire in the depths of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the co-help club hides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale took the fog and was immediately alerted by the witch who was in charge of the alert that a black gas wall was in front of her, but soon disappeared into the invisible, and it sounded in the darkness. The voice of the companion surprise, "You are back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s finally coming back, she thought, but when I noticed the two white cloths wrapped around my companion’s arm, The mood of the nightingale just leaped down again. "There are two sisters..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the other party has been stagnant for a moment, "Hey...ah, It’s Aining and Ai Xi, they didn’t get through adulthood five days ago.” She smiled reluctantly. “This is a common occurrence, isn’t it? Don’t say this, hurry to the camp, Wendy has been chanting you for a long time. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
