			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, Your Majesty... Your Majesty?" The sound of the diffuse star pulled Roland back from the blasphemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey..." He licked some stinging forehead. "Do these things only happen to astrologers?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All observations were done by people with star names, the disciples of the apprentices and the arithmetic school...not knowing." The old bachelor once again collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that Roland thought, it’s no wonder that the astrologer outside was a confession of the last words. If you can think of a heart-breaking gap, you can naturally think of the possibility that the lord will completely eliminate the truth in order to maintain the status quo. After all, in the past, the true purpose of the formation of astrological associations and the rumors of the Stars of the World are secrets that only the royal successors are qualified to know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a long-awaited king, a group of people who are very familiar with the court politics. Roland doesn’t know if they are persecuted because they are persecuted. Even if they know the consequences that may be caused, they will still report their loyalty. He shook his head helplessly. "You are doing very well. This conclusion is not to be revealed for the time being. Let's continue to work on your work. - I am not talking about stargazing, but the arithmetic school. It is nowhere to solve the problem. The troubles in the city are more important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stopped, he turned and opened the door and walked out of the attic, leaving only the old bachelor who had not yet reacted. Kneeling in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back to the castle." Roland screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagerness of the comparison, he even went a little faster when he went back, almost close to the trot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think the astrologer is telling the truth?" The nightingale who had been with him couldn't help but ask for his body shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know... just popping up some ideas," Roland whispered. "It's not a red moon but it doesn't mean it doesn't exist, maybe it It's something else..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" For example, a hole."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the preconceived reason, he has not thought deeply about the Red Moon, and the huge size is just because it is close, for example Looking at Jupiter from Io, the latter can occupy almost two-thirds of the sky. But now I want to come, the ancients called it the moon just because it happens to be round, and the light is not glaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is really eroding, it can also be square or polygonal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mood of the nightingale is full of confusion. "You mean, is our sky cracking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It may be worse than that, but I have to confirm it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to confirm?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland gave her a look, "Dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Although the weather is still early, it does not prevent him from entering the world of dreams, and this time he did not inform any gods to punish the witch, just let the night owl beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The day of God's life, when the meeting is agreed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is always looking for God What is meant by the generation, until this moment he is shocked, perhaps the other party is not referring to what happened in the dream, but the time in the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, it means that the person who left the note not only knows the essence of the dream, but even knows that there is a real world outside of it and can be sure The change to it - this may sound incredible, but when the Dianxing Bachelor said "Red Moon does not exist", the confusion and suspicion that had always been in his mind was like being worn by an electric light. together. Whether it is the "war of God" heard in Prism City, or the book of dreams without signature, I am afraid that he is leading him in this direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
