			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No winter city, flight training ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick, fast! Go faster, keep your body balanced!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your The legs are simply weaker than the baby!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Direction, pay attention to your direction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hey, where are you going? I really should put the brazier on both sides of the aisle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spell one side to spit, don't spit on the board, otherwise Give me clean!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, Goode!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Goodon had a sigh of relief, and he took a deep breath and walked to a swivel chair to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold face of the instructor's eagle face also caught his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it’s just a matter of sight, Goode will feel chilling – I heard that the other party was originally the commander of the Northern Territory, and returned to the Winter City without a rotation. The ground participated in the internal audit of the army and became a member of the Air Knight reserve team. This means that he not only experienced the church battle, but also gave up the holiday he should have and devoted himself to the new training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the other person belongs to the role that is embarrassing to others and embarrassing to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being targeted by such people, he only feels a lot of pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as soon as they settled, the two partners of the team, Finchem and Heinz, gathered around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their faces, Goode saw the look of self-seeking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chair was then quickly turned around-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is after he joined the reserve team, One of the most headache-prone training: a five-meter-long, palm-wide plank is called a flyover in front of the swivel chair. And they have to be turned for half a minute and then walked over the board. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who can easily do it in the usual way, become completely different after the rotation, the body seems to have lost the center of gravity, the world is shaking, let alone go Overpass, even standing still is not an easy task. Usually, the eagle face divides the ten trainings into one group, and the worst scores are punished by “cleaning the toilet”, “cutting the weeds”, or continuously switching to the whole day during the weekend break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode tried it once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result was that others were vomiting in the dorm when they were having a happy dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t want to come back for the second time because of such a bad experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a command, the rotating chair was suddenly stopped by the companion Goode resisted the stun of the brain and jumped out of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick! Don't lie, walk up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clenched his teeth and raised Sight, swaying on the board and walking towards the other side - after ten days of practice, he found a small cockroach, which is more likely to be unstable when staring at the foot, not as good as facing the front, using the body Memory to control the pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the foot came with a solid touch, Goode realized that he had finished the bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, great..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no failure in one step!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the first time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud voice behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But!" The instructor paused, and his tone changed. "Today, only one person actually passed. This is the worst one in all classes! His Highness Tilly said, the empty knight is one of the best, if you don't want to be All the staff brushed, always do some groceries on the ground, just give me the spirit, double to practice - rest for five minutes, then come to a group!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Everyone suddenly sent out a voice of mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, how did you do it?" Finkin leaned in front of Goode and squeezed his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember the magnitude of the step, imagine that you are not dizzy, just go as usual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Can this still be hypothetical?" Heinz also followed. "Isn't that lie to yourself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two are The same batch of applicants who passed the assessment with Goode, so they became familiar with them in a few days, and the empty rider put them together according to the division of the three teams. Now it is almost a "comrade-in-arms". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to swindle it, as long as you can pass it." Goode knocked his head. "In general, the smarter the more difficult it is to deceive yourself." "You should be able to do it easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it," Fingin disagreed. "Isn’t it a success? See you proud. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A gambling, I will be successful in a group of three...no, five times!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These clothes you want to wash this week are all packed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about underwear?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't fight," Heinz interjected, "I think I know that practicing these things on the ground can really become an empty knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were dumb, this question is also a common confusion for all the preparatory students. What is going to fly over the bridge, over the wheel, and discerning the wind... It’s more like a juggling than training a warrior. The personal teaching of His Royal Highness did not disappear, but the method was passed on to the backbone of the First Army, and then they were brought to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional training is very hard, from morning training to late night, after the night, you must also concentrate on teaching, learning to read and write, if not for your companion However, I am afraid that most people will doubt the authenticity of the announcement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of the instructor is so severe that no one dares to raise it in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows," Finkin shrugged for a while. "At least the food here is good, I can eat meat every day, and there are meals on weekends." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I felt that...His Royal Highness could not lie to us." Goode said, "Don't we get a bag of books that day, my sister." Tell me, there is a book called the principle of flight... It was written by His Royal Highness. When we fully mastered reading and writing, we might know the meaning of these exercises."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very optimistic," Finkin grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't think about anything, I will have died on the road to exile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Okay, rest time!" At this moment, the eagle's voice instantly overshadowed everyone's whispers, "Come up and line up and practice again in the previous order!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Everyone is powerless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the accident happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the training room was suddenly pushed open. A man in a military uniform walked in and attached a few words to the eagle's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eagle nodded and turned to look at the crowd after his march. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, the follow-up exercises are cancelled, you can take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
