			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the goal of this mission, Hillview realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene in the central land is almost the same as the information provided by Roland’s, the devil’s city is built around the obelisk, and the monument is separated from the city. A deep pit like a scorpio. Countless low-level devils stick to it, like worms on the surface of the trunk, but when you look closely, you will find that they are constantly digging the wall and expanding the pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red fog is deposited here, forming a red lake, and the tall towers near the wall of the pit will obviously fall into the lake and become giant pits. a part of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumored obelisk is not so great at the beginning, it breaks out like a living creature, grows continuously, and the pit that holds the red fog will continue to grow. Expand, so from these two points can be judged the age of a devil city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city in front of us is undoubtedly amazingly old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the target, the figure of the biplane can only be described as insignificant, let alone carrying the bomb, even if it is built into it, it is hard to imagine that it can be lit. Foggy lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Hillvi snorted softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Careful Wendy asked for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Found a strange...devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One appeared in the obelisk The devil at the top caught her attention - according to the habit of the devil worshipping the sky, the one who can climb the top of the tower is not necessarily a general. From the perspective of the other side, it is obviously not an ordinary devil. It was covered with a large cloak that could cover three or four people, and it was covered with dense garnishes. When you zoomed in, you could find everything from bone knives to metal plaques. Even she saw a few screws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy's head is also very special, it looks like a pillar, with many masks hanging on it, inexplicably makes people feel hairy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is its magic fluctuations very strong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...not strong. "This is also the most confusing place for Sylvie. From the appearance, it is at least a high-level devil, but it does not stand up after the appearance, nor does it have the intention of accumulating magic to launch the ability. The only thing that is done." The thing is to gather the gods to stare at the direction of the empty knights, completely without the meaning of participation in the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it doesn’t pose a threat to everyone, Sylvie is not too concerned, and now the two wrath teams that are bombing missions are approaching the edge of the city, she must concentrate The spirit can accurately determine the appropriate position of the projectile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two minutes later, she issued a bombing order via radio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of teams can throw bombs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goode understands."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even on a sunny day, the clouds floating on the desperate mountains are not too high, and the height of the fortress itself makes the sky wrath all the way to the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five biplanes lined up in a column, dropping a hundred and fifty kilograms of missiles mounted on the belly at a steady rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of heavy decoupling, Goode felt that the fuselage suddenly lifted up, as if the body was light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he could not witness the results of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five bombs were turned to the head down because of the center of gravity, and the inertia of the plane was given by a plane, falling in a fast falling arc. To the center of the city. At the last five hundred meters, they were almost completely perpendicular to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the devil also noticed these "uninvited guests" from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
