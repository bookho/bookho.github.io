			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collision between the two makes this piece of land boil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the blade of the cross, the electric light was shot down from the air, and the surrounding jungle was smashed. The black light of the demon is covered on the body surface, and the armor, like the armor, weakens the blow of the golden thunder. The magical turmoil caused heavy rain in the sky. In this dense rain curtain, the scene of the two men’s battles seemed to be the center of the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either Ashes or Ursuk, its movements have surpassed the limits of the past, and ordinary people can’t even see the movements, even for both parties. It is the normal state. Every shot will draw a clear trajectory in the rain, and the air waves caused by the collision will blow the raindrops around, and the sound will sound like a thunder, as if the human and the devil are fighting, but two The burly giant is in full swing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call...call..." Ashes feel that the magic in the body is completely out of control, they are swallowing a little bit of flesh and blood, making their bodies riddled with holes . After crossing a vertex, the pain of anti-phagment became numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is by no means a good sign. Losing pain means that the spirit is dissipated and the ability to control the body is greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she is no longer able to accurately guide all the thunder, and can only let the arrogant magic rush, this unreasonable cost further exacerbates the burden on the body. Both are like snowballing, making the balance quickly approaching the side of the collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that this is the consequence of direct integration with the source of magic?" The demon seems to be a little tired, it is forced to retreat after the assault I wiped the blood on my face. "While you have gained more power than ordinary people, you are being swallowed up by power. I am very curious to continue this way. What will you become? It will be burned into a fly ash by magic, or it will become completely Reason, can't even be called a human - a monster?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what I become, it is after killing you." The rain on the water, echoed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why? Faith and persistence?" Erskuk sneered, "It’s really like what humans would say... but unfortunately the long years have proved that Those are just trivial things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash no longer answers, but rushes to the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this short and intense battle, she has a basic understanding of each other's abilities - if she continues to fight, her hope of winning is only Will be more and more embarrassed Probably gradually familiar with the new limbs, the demon's movements are more and more smooth, and the strength and skills are steadily improving. Not only that, it seems to be completely adapted to the rhythm of fighting with itself, and regular sniping is now hard to hurt each other. This kind of invisible growth is really chilling, and it really makes her realize what the so-called talents can reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way she hopes to kill her opponent is to gather a powerful enough power - the ashes don't know why they don't have a gods, Can lead the sky, she only knows that the magic is responding to her call, and transforms into a golden thunder according to her will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the electric light that is handed out is a hit, and it will be wiped out by the black light of the demon. The rest of the power is only enough to add a few scars. Although the number of attacks is enough, it can also have an effect. Unfortunately, under the circumstance of power, she has not been able to support that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest problem is that it takes time to condense the mind, and it is absolutely impossible for the demon to sit and watch her complete the blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She must create an opportunity, an opportunity that will allow her to gather enough power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do next is already obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approaching to the front of Erskuk, the two of you came to me for a few rounds, the ashes deliberately revealed a flaw, and the big sword was emptied. The other side will naturally not let go of this opportunity, and close the five fingers to stab her chest. She avoided the key point a little, did not retreat, and directly collided with the demon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claws pierced her right chest and stopped at the elbow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes cough up a bite of blood, clasping each other's hands, whispering, "Catch you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the low clouds above the head began to spin, blinking There is a huge vortex! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say? Ashes her...become superior?" Listening to the inscription, Ai Gesha’s surprised voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the way to the west for a few miles, Lightning finally contacted the headquarters, reporting the need for emergency relief to the Ice Witch, and learned After she had already arranged for the first army to meet, she was relieved a little and told the story of the attack by the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides the extraordinary, I can’t think of anyone who can have that kind of momentum." The lightning slowly flew in midair, looking towards the jungle behind him. ——There is already lightning and thunder, and the golden long snake runs through the heavens and the earth from time to time. Even if it is a goddess, it cannot maintain this scene for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Promoting in battle is indeed a characteristic of an extraordinary witch. If she really crossed the hurdle, it would not be a problem to concentrate on dealing with a demon. It is the right choice to let you evacuate. In short, everyone is fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of lightning can’t help but the ambush squad is not without casualties, just her Did not tell the other party. After a moment of silence, she changed a topic, "What about the devil? Are they also ushered in the battle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, before leaving, The fear of the person is still in her heart, and she can't dissipate for a long time. Hersluck's standing posture and the black light that kept moving around the wound always gave her a very strange feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no such record in the federation, and according to the scenes that Roland has seen in the memory fragments, they need to successfully integrate high-quality magic stones to strengthen themselves. The power of Aegis. "Of course, it does not rule out that fighting has a vital accumulation effect on their promotion. The ability to withstand the magic, the so-called fusion failure, may be a manifestation of anti-phagy. Right, what do you ask this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, nothing..." Lightning bit his lip. "I just have some concerns..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a high-quality magic stone, it seems that it is not impossible for the demon to carry a few. But can someone really finish the promotion in a fierce battle? When the witch spent the adult days, she basically lie in bed, and concentrates on meeting the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, superior on top of the ability to fight, the demon person is useless to the witch's greatest restraint, I believe that will soon be able to win "Ai Gesha comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I think...also."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded and was about to drop the height When I returned to Mai Hao, there was a series of dull roars in the distance. Lightning turned his head and couldn't help but squat in the spot--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the dark clouds in the sky rushing toward the place where she left, and layered It became a gray "cloud tower", which slowly rotates, just like the passage connecting the sky and the earth. Such a strange scene she has only seen in the sea - when a strong storm comes, there will be a huge vortex in the sky, if you do not want to avoid or enter the center of the vortex, any sea boat will be followed The huge waves are torn into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but here...is land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened...things?" There was also interference in listening to the sounds in the prints. "What was it... what sound?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning can't help but put your fingers into the palm of your hand. "I don't know - how long will it take for Tirely's reinforcements to arrive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess of witches is carrying combat equipment on the Seagull. It takes about ten to fifteen minutes to get to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quarter of an hour? ... "I understand." She ended the conversation after a moment of silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
