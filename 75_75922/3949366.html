			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nights watch the changes in the magic of witches in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the black and white world, there are very few opportunities to see so many colorful colors, and the magic in their bodies has increased compared to the memory of looking for the holy mountain. Many, daily practice also allows the level of control of their ability to become leaner. But the most sensational feeling of the night is the look on their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the support was given, although there was Wendy’s gentle encouragement and Hakala’s firm action, everyone’s days of hiding were never really safe. After a while. Anything can be awakened by the dreams of the sisters, the chasing of the church, and the sight of the people's suspicion that they can't breathe. Even if they go deep into the desolate mountains, this feeling of oppression is not released much. Everyone is not sure if they can really reach the holy mountain and find a place to live. At that time, the atmosphere in the camp often became very low, and most of the sisters’ faces were stunned and numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they don’t have to hungry and don’t have to worry about the church’s hunting. Everyone’s face has an unprecedented look. Seeing everyone's relaxed and natural smile, the nightingale also feels the same. The sacred mountain is there after all, but it is not in the wild, but in this border town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she felt a magical shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of purple aerosols began to rotate, and magical forces were introduced around them like a micro storm. But this shock can only be seen by the nightingale. She has returned from the shock and she has wide eyes, holding her breath and not wanting to miss any details. This is her once compared to Anna and Soroya’s hindsight. See the magic and cohesion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the storm is Lily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was completely immersed in the microscopic world under the microscope, and did not notice that the magical power of the body produced a qualitative change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog is getting thicker and thicker, and as the rotation continues to increase, it becomes like a solid, and the contours also fluctuate, no longer presenting the initial swirl. In the end, the magic condensed into a ball and gradually stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her new-born magic is neither as hard and smooth as Anna's cube, nor as soft as Solo's soft satin. It is only the size of a fist, the body is round, and there are eight pairs of peristaltic tentacles on the whole body. The four pairs face down, and the four pairs face up. It looks like a...bug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not expect that the first natural biology class received results. And an evolutionary witch is actually Lily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because her previous ability was to keep fresh food, in addition to daily practice, Roland did not explain her other tasks, and she did not know much about her. After listening to the report of the nightingale, he nodded quietly. It was only after the end of the course that Lily stayed alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What, do you say that my ability has evolved?" Lily was also amazed. "I haven't seen the ball you said."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I won't see it," Roland smiled and shook his head. "The ball is thousands of times smaller than the microbe, even if the optical microscope is the limit, look There is no small ball that makes up the substance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it, I thought it was necessary to understand the theory of the ball to allow the ability to evolve," she muttered. "I I don't believe that everything in the world is made up of small balls. Things like rocks and steel are so strong. If a lot of small balls are superimposed, they will only become a sand."<br /><br />&nbsp Originally, he thought, it seems that microparticle theory is not the only way to promote the evolution of ability, "So what have you seen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well..." Lily thought. "A few purple bugs, I think it should be summoned by the magic. It can bring all the creatures you said." "The same pattern."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bug?" He gave a slight glimpse, "Is it as big as a microbe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost," she nodded. "After anyway, I used my eyes to see the drip, which is still transparent and colorless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
