			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleanorâ€™s so-called long time is not too short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last move and fall of the god of God took almost two days, and Roland also sent the first army to conduct a detailed investigation of the coast of Haifeng County. To ensure that no casualties will occur during the process of landing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days later, at dusk, the bottom of the floating land contacted the sea for the first time. From a distance, the huge inverted vertebral body seems to be independent of the sea antenna, which is the last time it was revealed. As the overhanging mountain fell into the whirlpool a little bit, the sea level began to rise rapidly, the beach outside the port disappeared at a visible speed, and the waves crossed the bank and rushed into the dockhouse and other facilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The abandoned vessels still in the port were pushed back and forth by the artificial tides and eventually torn into pieces during the violent pull. The wave of the impact of the tide on the land is endless, even if you stand a few miles away, you can hear it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stood on a safe high ground and witnessed the whole process of the god-made god entering the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, I am afraid that there will be no second time after such a magnificent scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His only regret is that he will not swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the historical habits, this time to come to the next one, regardless of the level, will be with his back, permanently into history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the afterglow of the setting sun once again appears behind the god of God, and the ripples reflected in it are like a light band, crossed over this new land. It has been extended to the lowlands of Haifeng County, as if the two are connected together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the god of God is quite large, it is not worth mentioning compared to the whirlpool, until it is embedded in the seabed and turned into an island, no The tide that passes through the port will fade sooner or later. The gap between the island and the mainland will become a new channel. At the same time, it is also the distance between the gray fort and the fjord islands. Roland has foreseen that it will become a bustling commercial island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect the devil's ultimate weapon to become the new territory of the kingdom," exclaimed the nightingale with him. "The future map of the Grey Fort looks like I have to rewrite it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beyond that, I care more about what the devil should do." Phyllis is more concerned about the problems that reality has to face. "If there are no replenishment stations along the way, they are only afraid to return to the mainland spine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These can be resolved through negotiation, we have already taken the first step, at least The result is not bad." Roland didn't know why he suddenly remembered the dream world. There, the devils came from a remote peninsula, and there was a sense of deja vu in front of the scene. "As for this new territory, it is called the Kajid Peninsula."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After the tripartite consultation meeting, there were not many twists and turns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning about the amazing plan of the mask and the fact that the king already knows what happened here, Heckzod is obviously somewhat absent-minded, and some questions even make the Cerro Greek is the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can probably guess the feelings of the other party, no matter what, the Lord of Scorpio does not want to completely fall out with Wang before getting the exact evidence, now suddenly find the king I already know everything they have done, which is equivalent to having no retreat. This is why Heckzod, who is cautious in everything, will inevitably give birth to the psychology of suffering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, silence is much more calm, as long as Wakiris is fine, and other accidents are irrelevant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legacy devil treatment plan in God of God is quickly determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland could not agree to establish a red fog supply line along the borders of the four kingdoms. The two monarchs also did not care much about the inferior body, so hundreds of thousands. The unscrupulous will continue to stay in the new island and undertake the follow-up construction plan; more than a thousand madmen will go to sleep to save the consumption of red fog, and then have the right opportunity to migrate later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Obelisk has now entered an irreversible state of apoptosis, and only the Lake of the Fog can provide some sputum replenishment and will gradually fall into disrepair. For the devil who relies heavily on red fog, this place has become an island. Therefore, after assisting in the transfer of the mother of the soul, Heikzod will return to Tianzhu City with silence to seize control of the remaining troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
