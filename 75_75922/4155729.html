			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to shoot, nor need to adjust the direction, to block what the troops have to do, it is to shoot as many shells as possible in the shortest time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone brings out all the skills mastered in daily training. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the design of the packaged ammunition reduced the rate of fire, the artillery elite still kept the three artillery at four levels per minute. The slight gap between them has created a sense of endless spurt, and the thunderous sound of repeated reverberations in the mountains is like a thunderstorm in midsummer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They fired!" McMug could not help but hold the head of the lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm." The latter responded softly, but in his heart he squeezed the sweat for the first army. They must have also seen the scene of the destruction of the camouflage position. Even so, the blocking force still chose to carry out the mission to the end, apparently determined. Therefore, she must also fulfill her responsibility and complete the investigation task well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many guns, but the momentum is not bad - probably the enemy did not expect it, the god of God will also be counterattacked by humans. When sporadic shells fell around the town, you could see a lot of devils fleeing and fleeing. Obviously, in this mobile fortress, in addition to a large number of troops stationed there, there are a large number of low-level devils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, lightning glimpses the human figure in the red mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also confirms the previous speculation of the staff that the devil is in the purpose of transferring the population of the control area. It’s just that she didn’t have much regret. The propaganda and evacuation of the Grey Fortress lasted for half a year. Today, they still insist on staying in the winter, mostly the vassals of the nobility, and those nobles are the most determined people against Roland. It is better to be armed against the same kind and not to resist the rule of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of Miss Itis, they only have their own little interest in their eyes, even if they are selling the future of the ethnic group. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the God-creating God moving forward, the shells fired from the artillery positions can already squat in the central city, but due to the high concentration of red fog, Lightning has been difficult to observe the results of the shelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi is now on the Seagull, she can always call the other side to help, but the devil city is likely to hide the warning eyes, once the eyes are intertwined The location of the Seagull will be exposed. Now that the sniper war continues, the uneasiness in the lightning heart has not dissipated. She always feels that the long-prepared attack of the devil will not end so soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as hesitant, the god of God suddenly turned slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw another tall stone pillar aimed at the direction of the artillery position-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shen, the moment she was worried about finally arrived, relying on a few Fortress guns and the Seagull number could not stop the enemy's ejection, and the empty knight was still smashing into a group with the fear of the beast. The fatal blow to the position was unavoidable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mc茜, the investigation will be handed over to you." She gritted her teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning no longer explains, she throws up the pigeons above her head Then, it slammed down and accelerated to the speed of sound halfway through the way - the ground forces were not equipped with listening and signing, and they were able to bring warning messages in time, and only her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance of several kilometers is instantaneous, and at that end, the huge stone pillars rise with magical brilliance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone - hide in the air!" Lightning slowed over the position and shouted with all strength. "The enemy has noticed it, and the stone pillar is immediately Come, find a place to hide!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Miss Lightning..." The cat’s claws followed and whistled. “Everyone, leave the gun immediately. Bit! This is the order, leave the gun immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunners who got the instructions turned around and ran towards the shelters as quickly as possible. The shadow of the stone pillar has already appeared in the center of the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this time, Shi Zhu did not roll on the ground, but knocked the ground out of a large gap - that is the collapse of some trenches and underground bunkers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough..." The cat's claws coughed and crawled out of the snow. The feeling of violent tremors passing through the soles of the feet was absolutely impossible. Well, for a moment, he felt that his internal organs were almost shifted. Fortunately, apart from the fact that his feet are still shaking, he is not a big problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Investigate the casualties and then withdraw from the position as planned," the cat claws slammed a soldier and said, "Put my words!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow the Chief!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pomelo, where are you? Cough... I heard a reply He looked up and shouted a few words, but there was a clear sweep of the machine gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there an enemy attacking the hills? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to wait for the cat's claw to figure out the situation, and the lightning warning sounds again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beware, the devil is hidden in the stone pillar! That is the enemy's real offensive means!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hiding...the devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat's claws quickly took the rifle off the back, twisted the insurance, and ran towards the scheduled retreat - the artillery was mostly behind the line of defense, so very few There will be guns, but this mission takes into account the risk of close-range blocking, not only for each soldier, but also for the two muskets as guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first response was apparently the experienced experienced Musketeers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the flying snow and fog fell slightly, the cat's claws found that several machine guns had blocked the area from the downhill intersection to the center of the position with crossfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the enemy is a small spider magic that has never been seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They climbed out from the inside of the open stone pillar and rushed against the line of defense against the rain - this spider is not half-human, looks and has appeared The polar-bottomed spiders of the North Port are similar. The head and forefoot are covered with a fairly thick black slate. The one or two bullets on the front will not be damaged much. The movement seems to be quite flexible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, it can also spray stone needles like a normal spider to carry out long-range attacks, but only need to start the front armor before launch. This also gave the soldiers a fatal chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat claws joined the firefight team and set up a long gun to join the interception battle. Although it is not clear how many such monsters are hidden in the stone column, this mountain road is the only entrance and exit in the plan. The comrades who have the ability to move will naturally gather here, and whether it is to rescue the injured or wait for the reserve team to support, All need to hold this level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be aware of your gun condition, don't let the trigger hold the trigger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ammunition , you need ammunition here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anti-Greek Grenade Watch - Put!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shouts and the roar of the machine guns were connected, and several spiders had stopped working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat's claws were shorted after a clip and replaced with a new clip. He noticed that this group of beasts is far more resistant than the madman. However, there are still some difficulties in the face of intensive firepower - the black stone armor on them does not completely resist the penetration of the bullets. If exposed to the firepower net, cracks and breakage will occur very quickly, and one bullet is not enough. That's ten shots and hundreds of shots. It's not difficult to do this for a well-equipped blocker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the storm-like blow can greatly suppress the opponent's ability to move. The main protection of the small spider magic is concentrated on the trunk and forelegs of the trunk. The fragile interior of the area will be exposed, so the barrage can only move slowly, which gives the anti-magic grenade an excellent launch timing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
