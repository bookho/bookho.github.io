			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the master of the drama retired, Barov immediately got together, eager and unfortunately overflowing with words. "Your Majesty, why don't you agree to his request? That is gray Synonymous with the drama, other troupes can't ask for it! I don't mean that the Star Flower Troupe is not good, but when it comes to fame, Ms. Mey is always worse. If you let Kajin Fez join in, Star Flower is The well-deserved kingdom of the first troupe! Even if he doesn't know anything about the shadow, just by the name of Kajin, you can draw a large group of actors, and the troupe don't have to worry about the shortage of staff."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland white gave him a look. "Don't you hear that the more easy it is to get rid of it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh..." The boss can't help but see, "Please forgive the ignorant, which person or book did you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said Roland pretends to be a serious man, "This is human nature, understand? He has been attracted by the shadow, what to say Will stay in the winter city, in this case, a rather difficult assessment is more impressive than direct promise, and even grateful for the opportunity I gave, otherwise it will make the other party take it for granted, this is It’s the difference between the two.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused a little,” What's more, Mey can only be a disciple in front of Kajin, with the drama master’s star flower theater It can also be called Star Flower. It is not a big problem to participate in the ghost filming, and it is free to join. If he is outside the group, he can also put some pressure on the younger generations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You...reported too." Barov hesitated, "but it made the wolf heart--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is better Roland went straight and broke. "That is his own choice. I want to see it too. I can do this on the card. I will be able to play a drama." Then, you are free to worry about it. Others, have the statistical work that I have given to you completed, and do not do it quickly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "Yes, your majesty... Chen retired!" Barov quickly bowed his head and turned and left the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are more and more like a king, and Wimbledon squats." The nightingale appeared from behind and squinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, haha...the prize has been won," Roland’s heart suddenly felt a bad feeling. He had not heard the other person’s honorific words for a long time. In our relationship, you don't have to use such a formal name..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I feel that being too close is not so good?" Tao, "The more easily you get things, the less you will cherish." This is what you think. It seems that I usually have to pay attention to it, I can't be too good for you. Also have to remind Anna, don't let someone be too proud. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland felt a cold sweat on his forehead. "Oh, that--this--in general, people are people, and the shadow is a shadow, neither is One thing! And this is not what I said first-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you agree," said the nightingale, "The magic of the chest tells me, at least More than 5:50 credibility. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to distinguish lies now is accurate to one decimal place, Roland wipes his forehead, etc... Chest? He remembers Ai Ge Sha said that although the magic power of the witch will show the shape of the cyclone under observation, it is not an entity, nor will it really gather in a group, but flow in every corner of the body.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really have the ability to use it? Roland questioned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," the nightingale laughed. "It seems to have been discovered by you." However, it is indeed what you said personally. If you let other sisters hear it, will you feel that you have been treated as a matter of course? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Five bottles of chaotic drinks. Roland launched the buying strategy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten bottles, the tastes are different. "The night licked my lips.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too much will make others suspicious..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What do you suspect? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, as long as I want to hide something, no one can find it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eight bottles, too easy to get, will be-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, nothing, I will consider it again..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Roland signed the "unequal clause" at the cost of ten bottles of chaotic drinks. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the victorious, holding the little fish and chewing the nightingale, he shook his head with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in the evening, Barov counted the list of all the visitors. "I compared the family record with the transfer contract, according to the former. The principle of determining the first batch of candidates to fertile plains, a total of more than 1,600 people." He reported on the phone, "the relevant visit plan is also in the process of development, if it is smooth, they can start two days later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good," Roland felt sincerely satisfied with the operational efficiency of the Executive Office. It is the chief minister who he has cultivated. Go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! It’s just that you have a worker who is registered as a witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witch?" He raised an eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the name of the worker is Snake, from the Long Song District, which was originally a Black Street Mouse; the Witch is a Miss White Paper."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White paper? Roland suddenly thought about it. When Pei Luo sent her over, she did mention her identity and a small dispute that she happened to meet. Is this person her former companion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to ignore it?" Probably he has not spoken, Barov asked. "After all, Miss White has nothing to do with life in the past." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland interrupted his thoughts, "Of course not. She said goodbye to the mouse career, not the past companions. Don't forget, radically eliminate the mouse. The key is to transform them, no matter what their identity, they should not look at each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former black street mouse, the current expedition workers... He raised his mouth slightly. In terms of time, the two have been two years apart, and it is very likely that they will not even know what they are. Even so, the companion still wrote the name of the other party on the handover contract, which is really not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will inform the white paper," Roland finally told, "The other will be implemented as planned."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you wish, sire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;******************* <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the open space southwest of Tower One, the First Army is holding a simple funeral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly three hundred white tombstones are neatly arranged in the Yingying grassland, which is solemn and orderly. Although there is nothing buried under the stone tablet, everyone is standing up, as if the comrades who have passed away are standing in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are sleeping brave people who sacrificed to defend Tower One."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In the face of fierce and terrible enemies, they did not step back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because they know that the Grey Fort is behind."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are both a sword and a high wall of the kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their names will always be remembered by us." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their will also be inherited by us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the King For the Grey Fort Kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
