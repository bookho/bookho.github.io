			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" After a screaming voice, the tiger's claws yawned and came together, "letter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth quickly pushed the other person's face away, for fear that his mouth dripped onto the notice. "Why, you are not sleeping?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hungry, want to eat." Tiger claws touched the belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then go to the water, and help me cook a bowl of porridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh," he said. "You haven't answered me yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth is helpless, "is proof of identity, and notice of employment." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" The tiger's claws were bright, and the body that had just been removed was squeezed again. He hooked the neck of the snake's teeth and shook it with excitement. "The City Hall finally sent you an ID card? Haha... This is something to celebrate! What porridge is still eaten, we go to the market to buy some fish. Dry and mushroom back to stew!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am still saving money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I can borrow you first," the tiger claws don't care. "You have been thinking about this for so long. It's not good to eat a meal. - What do you say on the day I took my ID card?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Snake tooth knows that he can't promise it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of their tall figure, the tiger's claws often work as a top two. After getting enough food, they are more active. Later, they are picked up by the foreman and picked out. The model of the third engineering team. Not to mention the salary increase, but also got a bonus, just to make up the first paragraph to buy a house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the migrants can obtain a stable residence, they can issue proof of identity, so on the day when the tigerâ€™s paw gets the new house key and ID card, the snake tooth not only marries him. He had a sumptuous celebration meal and moved the quilt clothes into his concrete house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," he muttered. "Wait until you buy the head office!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Hey, hey!" The tiger claw crawled back to the bed and began to look for clothes that could be worn out. "Right, what is that notice?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The employment book of the railway engineering team," Snake tooth took a deep breath. "I am going to work in a wild land soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What?" The tiger's claws stopped. "When did you apply for this? Why didn't you tell me before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In case you Do you have to follow me to do this, isn't this room no one to take care of?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is going to follow you, no...I am why Going to such a dangerous place?" The tiger claw raises the voice. "You don't know what happened in the city recently! There are devils there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, the border wall encountered a devil attack What can be described as ignited, first sounded the alarm after another, after another strange monster crashed into the city, and suddenly celebration held the evening is to let everyone raged! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland squats in public to announce the existence of alien enemies, and emphasizes the so-called wild land, not from the beginning! It used to be a place of human habitation and has a very nice name: Fertile Plains. Only because of the harassment of the evil beasts and the devils, human beings gradually retreated to the present areas of the four kingdoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some of those fugitives constitute the predecessor of the church, they render the enemy into an omnipotent existence, even connect it to the witch Together, this in itself is a nonsense that scares the courage. Facts have proved that although the devil is deceitful and looks terrible, it is not invincible. The victory of no winter city is proof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to open up new territories, and to protect and protect the winter city from attack, His Majesty decided to march into the wilderness and recapture this homeland that belongs to mankind. ! These words caused a continuous stream of cheers, plus the meat porridge and barbecue that the first army took advantage of, the atmosphere of the entire square suddenly reached its peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
