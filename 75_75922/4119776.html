			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant beast seems to be aware of the danger, seeing the owner fall, it flaps its wings and wants to escape from this place, but it is not estimated to come and go s difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The companions who disperse the firepower have not saved one, and they have no power to descend from the sky. The huge body is dragging the speed of climbing. If you stay on the ground, it will cause the machine gun team to worry about accidental injury and not dare to open fire. After rising in the air, there is no such concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, most of the high-altitude machine guns in the camp were aimed at this behemoth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intensive barrage flying from all directions is like a long whip, engulfing the entire beast - the sight of Mars can be seen in the area covered with hyperthyroidism. The exposed body is quickly shredded. This time it didn't even send out the sorrow, and it rolled back to the ground. The stinky blood smashed out of the honeycomb-like bullet holes and quickly gathered underneath it into a shallow pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha could not help but grow a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Zoe is not wrong, the god witch is indeed a powerful trump against the high-level devil, and it is no wonder that many high-level leaders of the Federation will fall to the Queen of Stars. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to ban magic at any time, bring enemies with different magic stones to the same level, and their strength is not weaker than the extraordinary, not only fundamentally solve the witch Defects with extremely unstable abilities can also take advantage of the number of enemies in an unprecedented way. For the federations that are losing ground, this is undoubtedly a dawn in despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the original vision of Akaris, as long as half of the non-combat witches participate in the transformation, it means thousands of non-combat personnel will A leap into the top force. The battle witches deal with the devil army, the gods punish the witch to kill the high-level devil, and the most difficult enemy is over the extraordinary, this is the battle of the empire to do its best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking that these goddess witches were originally used to kill the devil, it is only natural that the high-level devil can be resolved so quickly - in other words If they are more than a dozen people to deal with a high-level devil, it is not too difficult for the Queen of Stars to put the chip on this plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everything is too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha looked at the corner of his mouth to show satisfaction and pleasure Zoe, can not help but feel very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Federation can implement this plan at the beginning of its establishment, the outcome of the second war of the gods will be rewritten - at that time, human beings will lose In the light environment, there are still thousands of towns on the fertile plains, with a population of nearly 10 million. On this basis, the federation can form a powerful army that is not inferior to the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after the defeat of the Battle of God, leaving only the Queen of the Stars, there is only one corner of the land, and less than a million wild people. I am afraid that when she made this decision, what she thought was nothing more than her best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you kill it?" Aegusa walked to Zoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-level devils who suffered from fatal wounds are still not dead. These horrible enemies are even more tenacious in terms of vitality than the extraordinary ones, even without balancing the magic stone. Aegis also knows that the other side's magic is running away in vain, trying to repair this broken body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this does not mean that the devil can be seriously injured or not - the body's self-healing ability has limits, even if it is left, it will go in the magic consumption death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention a little red fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably more than the end of the other party, Zoe is more willing to appreciate the pain of the other side of death? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to leave it a life first," but the latter’s answer made Aegusa somewhat surprised. "There are a large number of devils coming here. Can get a lot of mist tanks. Deal with the wound and add some red fog. It should last for a few more days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to do? "The ice witch frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, although I personally are eager to put it in eternal torment, but that is without affecting the overall situation." Zoe is right, "If I remember correctly, in another witch squad, there seems to be a person who can link the soul?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoe nodded. "I know there is definitely a risk, but if it works, we will get a chance to face the devil. - As a superior commander, the things in its head are worth our risk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, this is indeed a temptation for the top to refuse, Ai Gesha thought. But now is not the era of the Federation, whether it is Roland, or Tilly Wimbledon, will not force the witch to go to risk because of a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Camilla Darry is willing to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she hesitated, there was a sudden explosion on the other side of the position! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here, I saw that the front of the north raised a lot of dust, as if it had been swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she did not hear a fierce gunshot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the enemy still have a beast team? Or is it... the line of defense has been broken by the devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha quickly activated the listening print, "Xilvi, what is the status of the front line now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" A monster that has never been seen before is attacking us," said Sylvia's anxious voice in the seal. "The front line needs the support of the gun!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the stone pillar exploded, the mortar shells also fell into the army of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the madman in the bones and leather, the 152mm howitzer and the mortar are not much different, instead the latter by the number and the rate of fire The superiority has caused even greater damage to the enemies in the run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the battlefield where the shrapnel flies, the unmarked and sprinting devil further fuels the killing efficiency of the shells, and it is normal to set off a bloody fog in an explosion. In the face of this continuous bombardment, the momentum of the enemy's advancement was curbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Sylvie has no intention to focus on the observations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to monitoring the movements in the air, there are only four evil monsters in her vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, against the crawling monster made of black stone and metal, the mortar is not so easy to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not a direct hit, it is difficult to penetrate its outer shell by shrapnel alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the black stone pillar grows again behind the crawling monster - Hilli found that it was actually part of the monster's body, whether it was a stone or not. The meridians are also a little bit peeled off from it and then recombined with the cylinder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that these enemies who can attack from a distance must be destroyed as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous round of bombing caused a lot of damage to the First Army - because there was no defense, there were more than a hundred people, or even a part of the front line. The soldiers were shot through the shoulders and chest lungs in the trenches. More importantly, it is undoubtedly a heavy blow to morale to suddenly suffer this unheard-of attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the enemy’s “growth” process is much slower than the artillery loading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The artillery battalion is fully reviving the erection of the fortress gun," Aegusa’s calm tone made her feel relieved. "I let the battalion commander come to you personally." Conversation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, hello... Miss Sylvie," followed by a slightly cautious voice. "I am the battalion of Fana." ... It takes a little time for the gun body to return to the state before the shooting. But fortunately, after checking that one artillery has not been affected - if you can tell me the firing parameters, I can now arrange for manpower to support. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi couldn't help but clenched her fists, and she glanced at the inspiration of her heart, glanced at the compass in front of her, one word and one sentence Out of position, "North Point 11 degrees 17 points, distance 2310 meters - please shoot!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
