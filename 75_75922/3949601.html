			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was studying the grid layout of the residential community when he learned about the incident. After listening to Carter’s report, he put down the quill and sighed. Although I know that there will be such a day, when he happens, he still feels helpless. After all, the prohibition of private sale of food has been repeatedly told, and some people will take risks for the sake of money. Obviously, for the first case of this type of case, it is natural to be severely sentenced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, as soon as possible to improve various types of laws, and then recruit a special legal officer to interrogate the case is also a matter that must be put on the agenda, after all, after the completion of the city, criminal behavior There will only be more and more, and he has no time to act as a judge all day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial was finally selected in the castle hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland will also recruit the general manager Barov to the castle to jointly try this private food crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, two arrested suspects sat on the ground, pale, and dull, seemingly never experienced such a battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Roland took the seat, he cleared his throat. "Tell all the things you have done. Any concealment or lying will make you sin." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes, adults," the two seem to wake up from their dreams, rushing to tell the story of food, especially the serfs, almost He shouted screamingly, "His Royal Highness, Lord Lord! I know that I am guilty, but I don't sell these wheat... I really can't live! The official lords don't buy wheat at your request, I don't have The way to do this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole case is very simple, and Roland has already sorted out the clue when he heard it halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to stabilize the hearts of the people, the amount of food ordered by the City Hall at that time was slightly more than the actual consumption, so the townspeople who bought the monthly maximum limit will always A small part of the wheat. Parker, who lives in the sixth district, caught a glimpse of business opportunities. He smashed the extra wheat into semolina, blended some of the wild vegetables he had picked up, and made the fragrant pancakes to the market to sell them. It turned out to be selling well. - This is another major function of the convenience market. Only the staple food is limited to the transaction, and the chickens, ducks and eggs raised by the town residents can be sold at their own pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This business can bring him several silver wolves every month, but the remaining wheat is only so much, if you want to expand the scale, you have to Save on diet. So Parker aimed at the serfs who did not sell all the food to the city hall. After several investigations, he contacted the "gold", and then there was the smuggler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the last sentence of the serf made Roland frown. What is the official’s failure to buy wheat? Is it also involved in the city hall? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Barov, who sneaked a whisper. "The Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for the acquisition. The minister is Sene Dali, should not It is possible to make such a mistake. You can call him and ask him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded and asked the guard to call the Minister of Agriculture to the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seni Dali quickly rushed to the hall. After he had a standard knight's ceremony, he asked what his deliberation was about. He still had some original moves. The style of the Wolf Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince tells the case of the unknown. "Do you have the refusal to buy the serf food?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Return to His Royal Highness, the situation is like this," Sene did not hesitate to answer, "According to your instructions, after the bumper harvest, we did not suspend the acquisition work, but gradually reduce the purchase price according to the quality of wheat. In the first one or two months, the price was almost the same as the original price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and went on, "but after winter, due to most The lack of suitable storage places for serfs, and the shift from the original shanty houses to temporary accommodation areas, the quality of wheat has fallen sharply. We often check for wet, discolored, moldy food during the acquisition, so the price is lower than at the beginning. Two or three percent. The food of this serf has been mostly affected by the tide and is almost impossible to continue to store, so the price I gave was 20% of the harvest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "There is no difference between the two and not buying, sir!" the serf shouted. "I have been in the field for a year, and the things I planted can only sell this price, which is worse than Black Street! You are not saying that the price of food remains the same!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
