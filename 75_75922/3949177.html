			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please don't be impulsive, Your Highness, I have no intention of hurting you. I am here just to talk to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, is there such a person to talk about? Roland swallowed and turned slowly. Under the threat of a dagger, he can only do what he said first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dim candlelight, Roland saw the other side - she was sitting by her bed, her body buried under her robes, her head covered with a hood. Can't see the true appearance. Candlelight cast her figure on the wall behind it, occupying more than half of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have a name, my sister calls me "Night owls," she stood up, pulled up her robes, and bent her knees for a long time. It was a standard aristocratic ceremony. "First, I would like to thank you, Roland Wimbledon." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks? Roland noticed that the lines on the robes of the other side gave a unique flash in the fire, three juxtaposed triangles, shaped like eyes... I have seen it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——"The pattern on the coin...is the seal of the Holy Mountain and the Eye of the Eyes, this is the emblem of the Witch's Aid."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly flashed Barry’s words in his mind, “You...what is a witch!?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hehe," she made a series of chuckles. "His Royal High School is very knowledgeable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sighed with relief, not the few The assassin sent by the brothers and sisters is fine. "You came to this remote town for the witches in the northern slope mining area? Although I don't know where you heard the news, it is too late to come. If I really want to twist Dead her, she has already died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know. And if you really want to do this, I will not just want to talk to you... "The nightingale re-sit back to the bedside. "The co-help club doesn't like people to intervene in secular affairs, especially things related to the kingship. But I don't really like to listen to them. It may be too much to kill a prince for a witch." But I can still make a deep impression on you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naked threat. Roland was relieved. "She lives very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, besides her, there is a little girl named Nana Va," she said Head, "I arrived here a week ago, but I didn't meet you. I have seen everything you did, although I don't quite understand why you don't have the usual malice of witches. No matter what, I represent the witch. Thank you for your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A week ago..." Roland wiped his forehead and said, "All that is done is in the eye?" "Is this guy always following himself, and he is completely unaware of it?" "Well, you said you want to talk to me, don't you just want to thank you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you standing and talking to me, not tired?" Said to fade the hood, "Please come here to say. I am not terrible, will not scare your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than not Ugly, it can be said to be beautiful, the moment the hood falls, the golden curls of the night owl are sprinkled like a waterfall, and the golden light of the candlelight slowly stuns; her nose is tall, her eyes are stunned, and Anna and Nana Vale's childish face is different, and her facial features reveal a mature style. Although it can't be carefully observed in the dim light, the patchwork facial shadow is enough to prove her beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland slowly walked over and sat side by side. He did not forget the danger because he was attracted by the other person's face, but simply felt that the other party was not malicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now you can say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, you are not afraid of me," woman The sound seems to be a little happy. "You are different from the people I have met... They hate us because they fear us. I can see the fear from their eyes, and you..." She couldn’t help it. Reaching out and gently stroking Roland's cheek, "Only curious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland coughed twice and removed his head. Feeding, the atmosphere does not change so fast or not, just as an assassin's creed, how suddenly became the overbearing president wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
