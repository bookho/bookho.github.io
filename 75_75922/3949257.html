			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third witch is a hummingbird, a short witch, just like her nickname. When asked about ability, it is much more cautious than other witches. She just became an adult this winter, and her symmetrical dimples and exquisite facial features match her soft voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ability is to "lighten the object", after attaching the magic to the object, it can greatly reduce its weight, according to her, close to zero . Roland let the hummingbird demonstrate it in the field with his own teacup and found that the cup could float in the air—that is, its weight was about equal to the air. Of course, in the eyes of people in this era, the air has no weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this is why the Co-Assistance Club can cross the Grey Fort Western World without replenishment. With the help of the little girl, the bags of wheat and dried fish can be easily carried on the road, and only a few people can carry a lot of materials, which can greatly reduce the logistical pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hummingbird, although an adult, did not derive branching abilities. Its main ability must be touched by the target, and it is ineffective for the living body. The larger the object, the longer the conversion time and the more magical it consumes. Once the conversion is complete, it can last for several hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability seems to be very suitable for the transportation industry, and it is also promising in the face of the upcoming war, but there are too many unknown factors that must be further tested to determine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland writes at the bottom of the parchment: practice with stones of different weights, control the magic output, and make the effective time and failure time accurately controllable . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After handling the three-person training program, he asked the attendant to add a new candlestick to make the room brighter. Even so, reading and writing are a painstaking task under the swaying orange candlelight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland yawned and spread the parchment with the fourth witch message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth witch is rare with a surname, the full name is Soroya. Zuon, the merchant's house from the Grey Fortress, has a brown Short curly hair and a pair of slender eyes. The freckles dotted on the bridge of the nose not only did not destroy the overall beauty, but also gave her a unique youthful vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soloya has just turned 19 and has a very special ability. When she is an adult, she can realistically draw the scenery of the characters she sees or imagines. With the branching ability "Magic Pen", she can paint a photo-like image without using paint or paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is comparable to the camera's ability to use, as far as training, let her draw a few paintings every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then pulled out the next piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth witch is called Echo, a woman from the extreme South, tall, with a brown skin, eyes and nose with typical sand characteristics, full An exotic style. According to her story, after awakening, the animal's screams can be simulated first. When adulthood, any sound can be imitated, and there is no branching ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland named her ability "The Magical Sound", the use of the moment is not expected, the practice requires ... just pick up two dice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth witch to be questioned is Lily. She is only sixteen years old this year. She has two ponytails and her face is as delicate as a doll. She sees herself. The expression is also a bit blunt. The ability is to prevent food spoilage. It takes only one year to wake up as a witch. She is already the most popular character in the co-help club. Without the ability to keep fresh, many foods will be spoiled and moldy on the way to exile. Lily, together with the hummingbird, propped up the logistical support of the Communist Youth League. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether this freshness-keeping ability is achieved through the magic killing of bacteria, Roland decided to let her practice with various meats and fruits and test the magic. The longest fresh-keeping time after exhaustion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licked the neck of the numbness, smashed the information of the six witches into a stack, leaving only the last piece of parchment on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is another surprise that Roland found after the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh witch: Mystery Month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
