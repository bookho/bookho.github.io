			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should all know that our city is under attack!" Isabella clap his hands and focus everyone's attention, "but the enemy does not It’s just a wicked beast. Behind this group of mutant animals is an enemy that is no less than the devil. According to reliable information, their offense will only become more and more fierce, and their scale will continue to expand until they are completely crushed!” Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no winter city and the first army will not let them arbitrarily erode this last human territory, but it is easy to deal with visible enemies, invisible It’s really dangerous. It’s not a metaphor or an exaggeration, but a description of the facts—” She said that she had a snap, and several soldiers slammed a huge piece of linen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“嘶——————”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly burst into surprise Inhale sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posanne is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was attracted to the steel giant after she entered the factory, and did not notice the gray cloth on the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cover of the cloth is actually a weird monster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s half-shouldered, nearly two meters high, and a pair of sickle-like claws hanging in the air, as if they would pounce on them at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a little more detail, you will find that there are many scars on the body. One of the wide thumb wounds is almost split from the chest to the abdomen. rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possan realized that this guy is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This monster in front of you is what I call "invisible enemy." Isa Beka loudly said, "When it moves, the whole body will blend in with the background, and it will look like it disappears." In order to kill it, the First Army paid the price of more than 30 people, which is what happened during the day when the vision was wide open. If the number of opponents is more, if the battle happens at night, the consequences will be unimaginable! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At present, we have named it as a beast, and there have been five records of the beasts that have been confirmed since the pioneering attack. Almost every record will be Along with a lot of casualties. This is only a specimen that was dragged back by the soldiers after the fall, and re-assembled according to Axia's retrospectives - no doubt, it must be our key goal in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can we do?" Amy asked with a raise.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good question. Isabella nodded. "The blade beasts are not devils or mixed species, but they still have a certain similarity. That is magic." In the eyes of ordinary people, they may be difficult to find, but for witches, as long as they have been trained, they can make them look like nowhere. And the only thing you need to learn to use is this --" She took out two shiny metal plates, "Magic Stone." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the other party's detailed explanation, Poshan finally figured out the purpose of forming this special force.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two stamps are called "scream" and the other is called "resonance". The former is used to prevent the devil, while the latter is used to discover the relics. However, after the improvement, they become the confrontation The key is .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screaming action range is about two to three kilometers, as long as the detection of magic creatures enters an alarm. The witch who gets the reminder needs to distinguish Whether the sound is caused by the beast. Once the target is confirmed, it is replaced by a resonance mark to lock the attacker. At this time, a “leader” will appear between the target and the mark, and the outline of the latter will be identified. When the guideline fires, it can effectively suppress the actions of the other party.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the principles sound very simple, their actual use is much more complicated.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first adjusted listening signature will also react to the mixed species. Witch can only use its own experience to identify the difference between sounds. When encountering a large group of evil beasts, the alarm will be filled with a lot of noise, so a single monitoring point is difficult to be foolproof.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly its perception will be weakened by a variety of things, including but not limited to hillsides, rocks, trees, etc., especially metal, a piece of iron can make it scope Shortened to hundreds of meters, so it must be placed at the forefront of the open space.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can teach you how to manipulate the seals, but there is no way to teach you to protect yourself." Isabella said in an orderly manner, "So your Majesty has arranged a suitable position for you, that is the chariot captain!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This steel tank known as the tank is a newly developed weapon of the Ministry of Industry. It has both attack and defense, even if it is under siege by mixed species. And retreat, the short-barrel field guns on it can destroy all enemies. As a car, you don't have to operate this complicated machine yourself, just direct the driver and gunner."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, when necessary, you can also cross the gunner's control and take the initiative to aim - the system is called the hunting fire control, and you are this The core of the system!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commanding, driving this behemoth...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about this stuff In the scene of crushing back and forth on the evil beast, Poshan could not help but give birth to a temptation  sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the next few days, you will be training with the First Army tanker to understand its basic performance. But the most important thing is the master. The use of India and the way to distinguish the enemy." Isabella concluded, "The time is tight, I hope that everyone can go all out, and finally through screening, will become a member of the first armored army of the Grey Fort!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Roland drilled from Fran, everyone was relieved, especially the staff of the staff, and everyone’s face showed a A relieved look. Although this plan was proposed by His Majesty, the specific details and implementation steps came from the joint planning of the General Staff. Once they had an accident, they would certainly not escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only exception is the Northland Pearl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the only person in the staff department who can communicate with Roland as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what the outcome of the talks is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's going to be better than expected." Roland Calmly said. He made a decision on the day after he had talked with Vakiris, but considering the conventionally agreed method of entering the dream is extremely risky and full of uncertainty for both parties, so he intends to use the most straightforward The way to complete the meeting - that is, directly into the dream without telling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts prove that the thick formation does not have any effect on the light column, and when both sides "hide their eyes", the alert eyes will not play any Early warning function. There were still a few witches who were guarding him at the time. Even if Heikezod found his whereabouts, he could not pose a threat to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the same method can’t be used more. It’s estimated that they will soon realize that they are not far from the hillside, if they are prepared in advance, Even if you are deep underground, you can't say absolutely safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is new progress, the devil should use a letter to contact." Roland turned to the iron axe and said, "Leave one in this area." The team is always stationed, and once the other party has any movements, report to me immediately. In addition, they are still enemies, especially the territories - once they cross the cordon, the troops must not keep their hands."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following." The general commander nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it is estimated that there will be no dealings with the devil, for a long time, Roland thought. In the dream, he can faintly see that the relationship between Wakiris and the Maharaja of Cerroshhi is not ordinary. At first, he was somewhat sorry that the devil who came to win the letter was not Heckzord, but now, the effect may be better than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, what is most needed for this kind of thing is trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just two hours later, Roland had not had time to return to Huiguang City from the North, and he received two erroneous news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of God made a sudden change, according to the lightning report, it is climbing vertically at a slow speed, the bottom is more than three hundred meters from the ground - this seems Violation of the staff's speculation that the height of the floating land is closely related to the consumption of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
