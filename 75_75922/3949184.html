			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather is getting colder every day, and Roland is getting up late every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a ruling class, he certainly has the right to sleep late. Especially the big bed with three layers of velvet blankets, the whole person will fall into the soft envelop when lying down, which further encourages his bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Roland walked into the office, the nightingale had been there waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, your breakfast, I ate half hot, it’s cold now," she said, half of the bread on the table. It is the appearance of the owner of this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one has taught you, should you be humble before the prince," Roland reached out and opened the plate and sat back at the desk. "Remember the beginning of you." Still very ceremonial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed in his heart, really did not see that this guy is actually a familiar, not accompanied by Anna, Run around and wander around here. She will hide her body shape before. Now, as long as there are no outsiders, she will wander around the office in a big way, even wearing a hood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like this?" She jumped off the table and walked an impeccable aristocratic ceremony. "You have been getting late and late, I Look at the breakfast and let it go, it will help you solve it. Your Highness," she got to Roland. "You don't care about it anyway? And you don't like the cumbersome etiquette, I can see it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have a blind eye to this guy, Roland’s abdomen, can you see it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed. "Let's follow you, but after you have had breakfast, you will finish it. If I want to eat it, I will call it again." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following, Your Highness!" She smiled softly, pinched the plate and ran to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland paved a blank piece of parchment, ready to complete the half of the design that was painted yesterday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to keep the town of Bianbu, the battle after winter is not a victory. Although an army that has not seen blood is not a qualified army, Roland is worried that if there is a large loss, this group of short-term training people will not have the courage to stand on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs weapons across the age to gain absolute advantage over evil beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, that is the musket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this era has all the conditions for the emergence of muskets. Alchemists often configure something called snow powder for the ceremonies in court celebrations. This stuff is the wrong formula, the burning speed is slow, and most of them can only be heard in the copper tube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About another hundred years, the prototype of the musket - the firearm will appear. Because of the cumbersome operation, this kind of firearm requires two people to cooperate to complete the loading and shooting action. Under normal circumstances, it can only be used as a single weapon. And its rate of fire and power is not comparable to a well-trained archer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is certainly not interested in repeating history. Like the steam engine, he can use the power of the witch to create a musket with real value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw the order on the table when you didn't come," the nightingale swallowed the last piece of bread and asked casually, "You are going to buy so many ice." What to do? Now in the winter, if you want to drink chilled ale, can you just put it outside the house for one night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper aristocrats like to use ice in the summer. Mang - that is, saltpeter to make ice, then cool milk, wine or juice to enjoy. For the blessing of the season, the price of the purchase of saltpeter is very low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being iced cheese to eat, the temperature is not low enough now, you have to freeze," Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman in front of her eyes, although not an enemy, is not as knowledgeable as Anna. Unlike steam engines, there is not much technical barrier to the musket. Once it is spread, it is obviously not good for its farming plan. Before I figured out her bottom, some things are better. Thinking of this, he tentatively asked, "Was the Witches Helping Society, besides looking for the Holy Mountain, is it also responsible for training the killers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
