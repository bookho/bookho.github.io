			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is just a guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The record of underground civilization alone does not give a real answer, for example, since they think they are all the way to the competition, they are eliminated, Where will the magical opponents leave traces of existence? Did humans start to appear witches before the first war of gods, or do they have the talent to perceive magic from the primate, even the farther breastfeeding era? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, or simply skip this ring, because a competition wins and directly mutates into what it is today? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer these questions, he probably needs a large number of explorers like Thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the most important goal at the moment is still to fight against the devil and solve the problem of survival. Roland believes that it is a matter of time to give him enough time to piece together the original appearance of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before this relic, has been kept by the church... Is it safe to keep it in the Star City?" He looked at Pasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you know this information, it is especially important to protect the safety of your belongings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, due to the existence of giant paintings, finding a place to bury a relic is just a slap in the face, and can not avoid the arrival of the war of divineity, so it has always been the most powerful The powerful witch organization is in charge. In addition, the evil spirits are extremely active during the evil moon, and the evil beast will attack Hermes as crazy because of the existence of the relics.” Pasha removed the huge body and let Roland see the scene behind her— - The body of the evil beast was piled up into two small hills, and the light blue blood flowed to the ground. "After learning that the Star City was hit, we recovered the relics for the first time. Now it is safe in our hands." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you block so many mixed species of evil beasts?" Wendy took a cold breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The scorpion instrument can specifically strip the magic of the target, and these mutant monsters have no magic support, and will soon die." Pasha will condemn The principle of the instrument is described briefly. "But only when the day's selector activates it can it really become a powerful weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exfoliating magic?" Roland has keenly captured the keyword. "Can't it be used against ordinary creatures? Can Shenshi be able to defend against the effects of the instrument?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, and it's straightforward Effective on the magic, the barrier of the stone does not work for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can cover more than ten miles without any side effects, which is a good environmental weapon It’s just that the starting conditions are too harsh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suspects that underground civilization is only a theoretical certification of this point, in fact, there is no real verification, otherwise it will not fall to the point of being eliminated - - It is possible to create things that you can't use at all. I am afraid that only in the era of magic will such a spectacle appear. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that human beings are innately disadvantaged in this respect compared to the underground civilizations that are advanced in theory and the devils that can cultivate multiple abilities. The random awakening and the erratic use of magic all indicate the instability of the witch community. Perhaps pulling the time long enough, the upper limit they can reach will be higher, but now it is just time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Tsinghua witch finds the winner, there may be no steel torrents in the winter city that have reached the devil's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, since the world is magical, he naturally does not turn a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easiest way to do this is to do both research at the same time - use magic to drive productivity, and then add resources to the magic of resources the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that any research project can be piled up with money and people, and magic is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basics of understanding are basically finished, and Roland knows when it’s time to talk about conditions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been generally clear about your situation. First of all, the devil is our common enemy. There is no doubt about this. One more man will have more strength and build up. It is a very necessary measure to unite the front and strengthen mutual assistance and collaboration. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
