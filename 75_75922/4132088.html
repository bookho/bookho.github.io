			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the devil army also launched an assault on both sides of the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of their sprint is extremely fast, it takes less than two minutes from 1,500 meters to the nearest kilometer, if placed in the daytime This is the distance that the naked eye can look directly at. Although Sylvia informed the liaison of the enemy's actions for the first time, it was limited to the dark environment at night, and the firepower of the First Army did not immediately suppress the momentum of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, even more surprisingly, when the bullet landed near the enemy, the devil would lean over and squat on the ground – with a strong The limbs, they are not slow to crawl, plus the scattered queue, the killing efficiency of the machine gun has dropped significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Sylvie’s impression, once the target entered the range of the machine gun team, it seemed to hit an invisible high wall. Wherever the firepower goes, the enemy falls down like a harvested wheat, and it will pay a heavy price in almost a short period of time. This has been fully confirmed from the unification of the gray castle to the defeat of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, most of the bullets that flew across the head of the devil's head, even if they just fell on the top of each other's head, it is difficult to cause a lot of damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she issued a reminder to the front line, the defensive soldiers did not make effective improvements because they did not observe the shooting results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s fortunate that Hillvi’s counterattack on the other side ushered in good results at the moment – ​​the dark curtains created by the enemy in the distance can only isolate the magic eye, and Unable to stop the shells, the distance of more than 3,000 meters is instantaneous for the fortress guns, and the flares even faintly illuminate the dark ground. When the first sand column rushed from the black curtain, the devil's stump and the black stone fragments were also flying out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the size of the blind spot and the frequency of the enemy’s projection, the spiders in the shady scene should be arranged in a column so that they can be plugged in a small area. As many distortions as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Incremented 20 meters in succession, continuous shooting!" Sylvia shouted at the hearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, the first attack to destroy the enemy is the most important Things - as long as the defense is still there, the devil can't easily cross the hurdle. The closer the distance is, the smaller the adverse effects of the night battle, not to mention the fact that the First Army still has more hands to prepare, not entirely dependent on the machine gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the force collapses, it is really irreparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the front line, the fish balls prayed that the stone needles should not fall on their heads, and they bite their teeth into the shooting position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he was already amazed at how he dared to run out of the trench. Before he changed, he was afraid that he would not wet his pants and begged. The commander left him a life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the phrase "You are not a coward" gave him courage, or the sound of gunfire that finally sounded behind him encouraged the guts, and he finally controlled himself. The legs, not the first officer who was killed because of the escape, although it was only a small team leader, it was also the leader of the team. However, Yumaru knows clearly that if he is usually asked to perform such a high-risk task, he will not be able to agree in any case. Even if the reward is high, there is no life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can only be said that the army is an incredible place. In the roar of guns, as long as one person takes the lead and rushes out of the trench, the rest of the people will involuntarily keep up. - Under the infection of this atmosphere, the fish balls even felt that their brains had stopped thinking about gains and losses, and the body was like a machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The squad leader, the chain is installed!" shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish pill takes a deep breath and lowers the Mark-type muzzle - although it is a high-altitude team, the gun still retains a flat-shot ruler and a simple sight. Can be changed to shooting on the ground target. At the same time, the baffles on both sides of the machine gun are mainly to resist the spear from the air. Once fully flattened, it means that the back will lose its protection. All he can do is pray only if he puts his head close to the baffle as much as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, as long as it is not on the spot, there is a chance to get the treatment of Miss Nana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
