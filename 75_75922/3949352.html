			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theatrical performances have been extremely successful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three Cinderellas were performed in two weeks, and many of the people watched it more than once. If the premiere is under the promotion and notice, there are so many people. Watch, the next two games are completely self-issued. There are even leaders who go to the town hall to ask when they will perform the fourth game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This response made Roland happy, everyone was completely attracted to the story, almost no one raised an objection, why is Cinderella a witch. When the "Midnight Chicken" is next month, it is almost a special event for the poor people. I don't know what the serfs would do to treat the witches who helped them in the play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also happy, the crew settled in the town and accepted the existence of the witches - after three performances, Irene took the initiative to find Roland. Asked him why there was a sudden "accompaniment" when the performance, and Roland introduced the echo to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark observation of the nightingale, Irene was shocked but did not show any resentment and disgust. After returning to God, she was still very curious. Echo asked Dong to ask West, and let her demonstrate the magic sounds several times. Therefore, the echo also joined the crew and became the master of the soundtrack behind the scenes. In order to avoid accidents, Irene only rehearsed with the echo when it needed to match the sound, and the rest of the crew did not know about it. There is no doubt that the next drama will reach a new high in sound richness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing to be happy about is that the castle is about to come from the age of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering water tower stands in the backyard of the castle. The tower is welded by an iron frame and is triangular. The top of the tower is connected with a steel two meters in diameter and three meters high. Bucket and bucket with float valve for extremely convenient water level control. The tower was welded by Anna, and then covered with a rust-proof coating by Soroya. Finally, with the help of the hummingbird's hand, most of the weight was removed so that it could be erected and mounted on a pre-cast concrete base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the height of the castle, the water tower in the backyard is higher than the Chishui River, which is close to 12 meters, almost the same as the top of the castle. In order to prevent the collapse, Roland also added a wall piece to the tower to make the tower and the castle as a whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steam engine is located outside the backyard for water supply to the water tower, which comes from the well in the backyard of the castle. Calculated, this is already the third generation of steam engines, the biggest improvement is the great reduction of noise pollution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At each connection point of the steam engine, a gasket is added - this light blue gasket is what Sorosa draws when it is in the sky The color is very soft and tough, which makes the vibration noise of the machine work greatly reduced. The inside of the cylinder and the edge of the piston are covered with grass color, which reduces air leakage and improves work efficiency. Parts that are prone to chattering, such as exhaust ducts, are all replaced with coated hoses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the steam engine from being exposed to the sun and rain, and to further isolate the noise, Roland also built a small room around it. The walls inside the house were painted by Soroya. The upper layer of honeycomb is painted and used as a porous sound absorbing material. The actual test results show that even if you run at night, the noise of the machine will not wake up the sleeping people in the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland’s attempt to get the steamer to feed automatically failed. He originally envisaged that the steam box of the steam engine governor would control the wooden box door. When the steam pressure dropped, the fly ball would open and open the valve, so that the wood in the wooden box would roll into the furnace, but the governor would have to Do a lot, otherwise the weight of the flying ball can not drive the door. When Roland wants to think about it or decides to give it up, he can fill up the firewood in the wooden box at most. After using it, he has to fill it up manually. It is better to arrange the manpower to fill the water tank every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final step is to get the water into the home – including the faucet, shower, plumbing and the corresponding drain installation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the castle is not like the newly built brick house in the community, the remaining holes are left, and the roof and wall of the stone are very troublesome to transform. This step is full. After spending nearly a week, in order to have a happy and happy life, Roland personally directed Carl to transform one room on the second and third floors into a bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soloya’s new ability once again played a key role, paving the floor of the drainage pipe with cement and then painting a thin layer of grass. Not only can it be waterproof, but when walking into the bathroom, it is like walking on the grassland. Inspired by this, Roland simply let her paint the entire room. The ceiling is empty blue sky and clouds. The walls and green areas can be seen from the four walls. The walls of the bathtub are crystal clear and sleek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
