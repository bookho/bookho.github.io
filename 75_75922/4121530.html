			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disability of the warlord’s words made everyone frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy is fighting two wars at the same time, and the other side is their main battlefield? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other party’s words are not empty, the battles of the previous gods and the humans are only a small part of the power of the devil, then the situation is still clear, suddenly It has become a bit less optimistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combined with the sights seen in the realm of the gods, there are four competitors in the huge paintings, aside from the underground civilization that has been delisted, Roland speculates The so-called "Tianhaijie", in all likelihood, refers to the last and most mysterious deep sea eyeball scroll. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the enemy fight the monsters in the sea after winning the relics of the underground civilization, and at the same time have the resources to suppress the human beings? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, then the scorn of the witch in the high-level devil's tone is not unfounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for ordinary people without magic, I am afraid it is no different from the weeds on the roadside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he also knows that the other party can’t honestly explain everything he knows – from its insistence on being alone in the artillery position, to conceal its mind. Using the power of the soul to encroach on Zoe's body can be seen, obviously even in a desperate situation, it has not let go of a single attack. In the absence of a way to identify lies, it is difficult to ensure that the other party is not deliberately bluffing, deliberately wanting to cause human panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the people who are looking at the dignified, Roland knows that at this moment, the situation must be returned to the control of one's own side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he shrugged and made it easy to look at Elsie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So...this is the real devil here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter also reacted "Although I don't know what method Zoe used, I don't think she would say such a thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job, help me Saved a nap time," Roland nodded to Zoe. "Tonight's dream, you want to eat anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you Zoe couldn't help but raise his mouth, but he quickly recovered his normal expression. "It's a pity that this guy is already familiar with human perception. Although he can't control his body flexibly, it's hard to read the real thoughts." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not your fault. After all, no one has ever been in contact with high-level devils before, and it is normal to use human experience to judge mistakes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil? You are still using this ridiculous title," Cabrada said, dismissive. Different from their own group, they belong to the horrible and evil existence. They don’t know that they are insignificant and low-ranking barbarians. But your good fortune is here, and the source of magic is once again in the world, when you are dead!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one to look at each other. The last sentence is really like something in the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The source of the magic you said... refers to the Red Moon?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All things can only see the superficial surface, but it is the consistent style of your reptiles." The high-level devil is undecided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the red sphere made up of magic?" Ai Gesha said, "But it doesn't make sense, I have seen the Red Moon with my own eyes." No matter what it is, it is a distance of tens of miles from the world. You have clearly said that the final upgrader will open the way to the source of magic. Is there a ladder that can lead to the sky?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哼." Cabradaby turned his head and apparently did not want to explain the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is Tianhaijie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
