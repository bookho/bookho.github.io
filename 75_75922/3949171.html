"This way, it takes a lot of manpower to dig trenches. Your Highness, if you can give me 150 people, I should be able to dig this trench before the coming of the Demon Moon." Slot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A ditch can't stop the evil beast," Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the case, if the wall is built of stone, it will take three years. If it is only to stop the evil beast, the wall can be built as high as about ten. Two feet away, the width can be reduced by a third, and the bottom is reduced to six feet. Digging the trenches and walling at the same time, the number is increased by two hundred... So, I can finish it before the coming of the demon moon next year. It."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlton paused and went on, "Please forgive me, Your Highness, now is not a good time to start. If you don't build the wall in time, Even if the trench is dug, it will lose its original function after being soaked in the whole winter rain and snow. Then you will spend more time and manpower to clean the softening trench and deepen the excavation depth again." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you say that the wall is 12 feet high and four feet wide, how long does it take for the trench to be dug?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should take a month and a half," Carl replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then do it according to this plan, grooving and masonry at the same time, before the coming of the demon moon." Roland waved and interrupted Carl. To say, "I know what you are worrying about, look at this, the latest work from the Grey Fortress Alchemy Workshop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He naturally has no time to stick again A stone brick was given to the stonemason, but the two pieces were glued out and displayed. Fortunately, the prince spoke almost no one dared to question, when Carl heard that this alchemy binder called cement could be converted from liquid to solid between day and night, and produced a very high adhesion, his face was exposed. Unbelievable shocked look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first half of his life for the stonemason will naturally realize how great the invention is, besides bonding stones, and more importantly, it can be shaped at will. Form. Isn't this equivalent to having any shape of stone directly without secondary cutting and sanding? It can abandon the time-consuming and laborious processing stage, and the speed of any building will be put up to a new level. This is enough to be exciting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at the other person with satisfaction and asked again, "How, do you think three months is enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karl. Vabert’s voice is a little trembling. “If you’re right, no, no, I’m saying... If the alchemy workshops are correct about this, I’m... I am willing to give it a try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, how to use cement, I will let people write a detailed information for you, and if there is any other need, then My assistant minister talked," Roland laughed. "Mr. Carl, now you are a member of the Executive Office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Nana Wah is The next afternoon. The little girl looked at Anna with a blank look. She grabbed the corner of her clothes for a long time and said, "Is it already... dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I saw it When she was, Roland had to admit that the power of the witch not only gave them magical power, but also changed their appearance and temperament to some extent. She and Anna are very different types, but they all contain a unique charm. This feeling has nothing to do with age, and has nothing to do with the state of life. Even if Anna waits for death in prison, the radiance is still unabated. Throughout the memory, whether it is the street hooligans of the Grey Fort or the aristocratic lady who is well-educated, he has never felt this way. If you want to describe them, put them together with the witch, like a colorful character in a black and white photo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl Vanbert, who brought her, retired with enthusiasm, leaving only Roland, Anna and Nanawa in the palace garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not dead, Anna is living well," Roland said with a smile. "I am the four prince Roland Wimbledon, and you are ——”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
