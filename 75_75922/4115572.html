			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" Roland looked at the light curtains on the wall, wanting to understand the devil's intentions, and the Tacitahs are undoubtedly the most able to speak. a group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old tricks," Elk snorted. "Intimidation doesn't work, it's time to take force. I have said that threatening pressure." While approaching step by step, they are the masters of dealing with the human lords. If you change to a witch city, the devil will only choose to kill them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The last estimated devil advancement time was around half a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, which is calculated based on the average construction time of a large camp, perhaps they It’s too anxious.” The latter’s voice was a little embarrassing. “I’m going to say that the war situation is ever-changing. It’s stupid to follow the picture. I didn’t ask you to relax your vigilance.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, this joke is getting bigger, it’s necessary to keep monitoring, but the plan is based on the time node. If the enemy needs half a year to stand firm, his rails can be placed on the opponent's face. When the armored trains and the track cannons were together, he did not believe that the devil had the energy to open the outpost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aer's did not deliberately conceal. I also agreed with her before." Aegusa saw Roland's suspicion and said, " The timetable for the red line expansion is that the Federation paid a heavy price to get the information, and until the destruction of the Holy City, this part of the information has never been missed - and half a year is the limit of the devil."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what you mean is that the devil has now broken through this limit, and the timetable for the exchange of blood does not work?" Itis is a handkerchief. "Of course, the ancient intelligence of four hundred years ago was ineffective, and it was not something that could not be understood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but brow, if it was present Ordinary people dare to stand up and "the sarcoma monster" tit-for-tat, Northland Pearl is undoubtedly one of them... Considering that he is not a normal person in the true sense, Itis can even be said to be the only one. One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerna actually reacted, "mortal, you-!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in her Before the complete anger, Pasha's voice was inserted in time. "Maybe those giant skeletons make the expansion of the red line more rapid, but it may be that the devil has other purposes. If it is not for offense, the outpost can indeed be opened. Earlier, after all, its size depends on the supply of red fog. So you don't have to argue about it. You have to look at what King has to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is worthy of being the actual leader of the remnants of Taqila. Roland secretly nodded. This speech not only makes the possible disputes disappear, but also takes into account his feelings. The speech is really an art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the real problem still exists – whether the devil has an attempt or an early attack without a winter city, this change has made him lose The surveillance of the ruins of the Holy City. For the absence of winter city, there are not many countermeasures to choose from: if the illusion instrument is not positioned incorrectly, he may still be able to observe it for a while to see what the devil has in mind, but now he must get rid of it as soon as possible. This obstacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let the first army prepare for the expedition," Roland took a deep breath and turned to the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty!" Shamin’s answer is always clean and neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The choice of courage," Elx praised. "It is tantamount to committing suicide when the war arrives. We must always keep an eye on the enemy's movements. In order to be prepared,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The staff, come up with at least one plan before the sun sets," he glanced at Itis, "I To see the detailed process derivation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty," the dawning singer-in-law, Philin Sylt, has a hard time, "according to Miss Hilvey The intelligence, the flying beast has occupied the area, there is almost no way to ensure that the First Army will not be found in the march. Once exposed, we are afraid that it will be difficult to move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp;Roland is also aware of this, so I want to get a detailed deduction before departure - as the designer of the whole army weapon, he naturally knows that the statement of the film is enough euphemism. If the high-altitude machine gun can't be set up in advance, the effect will be greatly reduced. At the same time, unlike the city wall defense war, the enemy may come from all directions, which raises the requirements of the barrage several levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From no winter to the enemy's suspected outpost, almost four hundred kilometers, minus the part that crosses the lost forest, there are also 178 kilometers, and absolutely no way to finish in one day. Not only will they have to camp in the middle, but there will be more than one, and they will all be exposed to the eyes of the flying devil, becoming a deadly weakness of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t have as many Sylvies to ensure that every squad can avoid the devil’s attack; the logistical team, usually composed of recruits, is attacked by enemies. After how hard to play, Roland did not report much hope. If the logistics line is a collapse, let alone the first step, the first army may not even be able to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more this time, the less he can hesitate to show up, "Do the first thing, other things I have seen before I talk!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, squat." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the night passed, the staff delivered the plan the following afternoon. come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporter is Itis Kant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't sleep?" Roland noticed that her eyes were slightly swollen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is rushing, I am so embarrassed to go back to rest," Itis shrugged. "It’s just a sin for the last fault." Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite a slogan, Roland does not care to wave his hand, "You can say the conclusion directly."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," she pointed to the left side of the desk. "If you follow the normal marching method, the main army will be noticed by the beasts. After that, how much can they do? Because of the lack of intelligence in this area, the staff directly assumed the worst-case scenario, and concluded that the first army could achieve its goal, but it would also be defeated by the devil. The troops of 5,000 people could probably Fleeing back to about half. The witch’s danger is not great. If you don’t take risks, you should be able to return.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This deduction is really harsh,” Roland For the forehead, "Is there a problem with logistics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Tis did not shy away from the road. "The supply route was attacked by the devil. The first army had to be divided and protected. But it is impossible to completely contain the enemy. Under the day-to-day casualties, morale will be frustrated and affected. Confidence in the front line. After a week, the enemy's attack will become more difficult to ponder, and the main force will begin to attack the enemy's camp. This part can be said to be the simplest part of the battle, your army successfully destroyed the devil's outpost However, there was a big fire in the rear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Winter City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, It’s really a big fire—the devil noticed the abnormal performance of the lost forest and decided to set fire to the forest. This will make the safe passage constructed by Miss Yee no longer exist, and if the transportation route is tripled, the first army will completely lose. Replenishment, thus losing the firepower advantage to the enemy, so you can only choose to break out." Itis coughed twice. "Of course, we may set the number of devils a bit, but this is also uncertain, from the right From such an urgent action, they may not easily give up the outpost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but laugh, "There are more enemies, set fire to the forest." Which bastard is this idea?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yu Xiaochenguang." Itis slowly said, "But after our analysis, as long as the time is long enough The devil finds that the probability of a problem with the hidden forest is getting bigger and bigger, so this possibility cannot be ruled out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Roland’s heart was ready, the first time I saw such a pessimistic deduction was still a bit depressed. "What about the second?" Don't tell me the same result - you have been busy for a night, just want to tell me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also knows that if you want to compete with the devil in the fertile plains, land transportation is a problem that will be faced sooner or later. If it is easy to use ammunition And the grain was sent to the frontline soldiers. Why did he have to work overtime to build a railway?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
