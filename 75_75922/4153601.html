			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Roland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland, what are you doing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle, come and save people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two sounds alternately ringing, leaving Roland out of sight When Zhongla returned to reality, he blinked, the light column and the snowflake film disappeared without a trace, and a messy bridge reappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jielu and Wakiris are cleaning up the ruins, and from their look, the change seems to be still over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes--he suddenly remembered that before he made a phone call and made him aware of the difference, it was the genius of the association’s martial arts, but where is she now? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the "salvation" in Jieluokou means -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suddenly looks Condensed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thoughts finally returned to the right track at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He temporarily threw the previously seen footage behind his head, and rushed to the two people in three steps and then couldn’t help but take a breath. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a woman with a flesh and blood lying in a shallow pit that was thrown out by a heavy object. Her limbs were almost completely crushed except for the left arm. The broken bones and blood clots were mixed together and had no shape. The body is also a patch of scales, the clothes are almost completely saturated with blood, the spine is also twisted into abrupt fold lines, and even puncture the skin to reveal half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is put on the battlefield, this is an unbearable scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the broken side of the face, this person is Fijian cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still has a breath of breath, but it’s just a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland squatted down and didn’t know what to do for a while . First aid? Even if there is a bandage, you can't pack the broken organ back into place. Not to mention the hemostasis, there is no perfection in the body, and the function of the body has collapsed. It is entirely by the power of nature that the spirit is not determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this power is like a candle burning in the end, and there is very little left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, being able to maintain awareness in such situations requires a strong will, even if it is a martial artist, few can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The master is like this to protect me..." Jieluo has been crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is going to die." Wajilis also saw this. "Even if the Maharaja was so badly hit, put it in the Dianchi." It can only be delayed for a while. Moreover, the level of medical skills in this world is far less than that of Dianchi. Even if she has a lot of magic, she can't reverse the process. As a warrior, she insisted on the end."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You finally...coming." As if they heard their voice, Fiji whispered his eyes slightly. "I should call you... God?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tone is mixed with a little humor, and her expression is not like a person in desperate circumstances. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Roland couldn't help but hold it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry... I overheard your conversation." She blinked at Vakiris - this is the only action she can make. "But if I can come again, I still... I will do this. Jieluo... Is she okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few words, just Like exhausting most of her strength, only holding her breath can she hear her whispering almost whispering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, I...very good..." Jie Luo whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you know that the world is just a dream -" Wakiris frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe for you, there are several in the world, but for me... it is the only one. And guarding this world is a martial artist. The unshirkable responsibility." She paused a little. "I said... God, you have to trust everyone since you created it, aren't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Trust... everyone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know this sounds like...unbelievable, but as long as you come up with proof, the association’s top...not It’s so stubborn. There aren’t many things we can do, but it’s not useless... even if you can’t beat God, you can at least help you share the pressure. So... saving the world will become easier?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collecting the power of everyone-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suddenly flashed an electric light in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he is the creator of this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a god of omnipotence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some things he can't do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but others can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combining the power of everyone, maybe you can achieve some seemingly impossible miracles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last thing I want to say is...thank you." The voice of Fiji’s cold has been fine as a gossamer. "Thank you for creating it, even if it is just one." Dreamland - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the world is not a dream." Roland interrupted. "It exists in the consciousness world and will continue to exist." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know... you will say that." Fiji closed his eyes and showed a satisfied smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, I feel that even if I have come up with evidence, it is too convincing to say that I am a god of creation. But if I add If you are a martial artist, the effect may be very different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She moved her lips. "Are you here... comfort me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not comfort, but the assertion of the founder." Roland stood up. "Listen, now is not the time to give up! Since you mentioned trust, Then believe me, this is far from irreparable!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because, I am a god--"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream was interrupted, and Roland sat up from the lounge chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment it is still in the afternoon, the snow fluttering outside the window, the nightingale in the office flashed in front of him for the first time, asking with concern "Do you wake up so quickly? Is there any discomfort?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time he has entered the world of dreams after two days of coma, usually in usual habits. I will sleep from noon to about four o'clock, but now it is not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, I have nothing." Roland solemnly said, "You go to inform the book and the honey, let them immediately come to the castle, I have important tasks. To arrange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale still carefully examined his temperature and pulse, and nodded after confirming that there was no problem, "I understand."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the other party broke into the fog, Roland returned to his desk and laid out a pen paper plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save the life of Fiji, you must let the two worlds work together to launch a joint rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you leave the dream, the time there will be static, which will undoubtedly get a crucial moment for the rescue. Even if there is only one breath left, if he does not dream again, this tone will not end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of the resurrection is the new ability of Nana Va - the magic compound attached to the healing power. As long as you use enough quantity at a time, you can suppress the disintegration of your body function. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
