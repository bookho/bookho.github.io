			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, the Mengmeng skyline just appeared a touch of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people are still asleep at the moment, but in the new outings on the outskirts of Huiguang City, the garrison and ground staff have been busy for a long time. They rushed to the ends of the runway against the cold spring breeze, and the inner lining was wetted by the fine sweat that was leached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plane was towed out of the warehouse and towed to the end of the runway. The final filling, filling, and inspection work has also come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the barracks next to the landing site, Tilly brought together all the empty knights with practical experience. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several rounds of enrollment expansion and the introduction of new teaching methods, the number of people who can go to the battlefield is currently over 100, and those who are following intensive training are There are twice as many, and the "new army" that has been independent of the ground forces has been faintly formed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous battlefield of the desperate mountain range, although the aircraft lost a lot, but the probability of the pilot surviving is not low - it is difficult to get rid of the devil compared to the infantry Pursuit, once the encounter is a bloody battle, even if the Skyfire loses its combat capability, it can quickly leave the battlefield by relying on gliding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whether it is shot down by an enemy or a mechanical failure, as long as it is not too bad luck, experienced pilots can basically stick to a suitable landing zone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is also related to the speed of the biplane, the natural lift is good, and the devil's throwing spear lacks the ability to kill a deadly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors make the entire team mature at an extremely fast pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should know very well about the details of this mission." Tilly embraced her hands and walked slowly through the front row of the team - and forthcoming Like the warrior, she is also wearing a thick windproof combat uniform. The gray long hair is behind her head, with a blue band, which looks neat and spirited. "Break the enemy's defense and throw the bomb into the hinterland of the floating fortress, just like the contents of the previous few days of training."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this time you fly The airspace is no longer the outer suburb of Huiguang City, but the head of the enemy fortress. It will not be a college student, but a fearful beast and a high-order devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness!" Suddenly someone raised his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that simpler?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker is Goode, which caused a low sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly also raised her mouth, she did not oppose this "arrogant" dialogue, but on the eve of the expedition, the arrogant warfare helps everyone ease tension . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, Goode has already achieved the record of killing twelve beasts, which is not too conceited by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh it seems so, but the high-level devil behind the beast is still an unbeatable opponent, I hope you can come back to prove it." When it comes to this, I have to turn around. "In addition, I must emphasize that the floating land area is extremely large. The sudden entry into the central area means that the surrounding area is the territory of the devil. It is conceivable to force the landing there. So this action should try to avoid accidents. I am gambling with the opportunity of being inserted into a spear by the devil in exchange for the idea of ​​killing the fruit. I ask you to leave it behind and understand it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow, Your Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, then the next team arrangement - the person who was assigned to the "Furious" will take on this The bombing work of the subtask. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the empty knights erect their ears when they say this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the first improvement of the Skyfire, the fuselage is more compact, and the cockpit has a circle of glass top cover. Not only is the shape more beautiful than the Skyfire, but the performance is also improved. The most critical change comes from the new star engine. With the external weapon system, the former is a degraded version of the Phoenix engine, the power is limited to a lower level, and there is no supercharger to meet the production level of the assembly line. The latter can be determined by the task, including the machine. Guns and bombs, etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
