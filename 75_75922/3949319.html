			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has long conceived bullets on runner firearms, round lead and bulk gunpowder are too backward, considering the processing capacity of Anna, directly making copper shells Loading ammunition is technically feasible. The key is how to ignite the black powder filled in the shell without a reliable primer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom fire of the early metal shell assembly bomb is generally very sensitive to the impact of mercury sulphuric acid, the trigger is pulled to trigger the striker, and the mercury sulphuric acid at the bottom of the bullet is activated. Thereby igniting the hair, and shooting the warhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he wants to break his head and can’t think of the kinds of raw materials needed to make mercury sulphuric acid. From the literal point of view, there must be nitric acid and mercury. However, the handwritten reaction formula shows that the reaction of these two substances only produces nitric acid * mercury. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And light knows that the raw material is not equal to the smooth production of the finished product, whether the solution has concentration and temperature requirements during the reaction, and the need to add catalyst does not affect the finished product. The key factor. What's more, due to its sensitive nature, mercury sulphate is easy to trigger an explosion when it is manufactured. If you don't pay attention, you will lose two fingers, so he is too late to try it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Roland had to retreat to the next level. In the case of using a metal case, the ignition method was still used, which required Mars to enter the inside of the case and ignite the gunpowder. . Therefore, first the hole must be left at the bottom of the shell, and the gunpowder should be prevented from leaking out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is obviously an irreconcilable contradiction between these two points: the larger the opening, the faster the gunpowder leaks. If the opening is too small, it will be difficult for Mars, which is shot by Meteorite, to ignite the gunpowder inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs something that can be ignited by Mars and blocks the opening to prevent the gunpowder from leaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland first thought of nitrocellulose, also known as fire cotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the few chemicals he remembers that can be used for weapons - because it is very simple to prepare: cotton soaked in two strong acid mixed acids Just in the liquid. Acid is the most commonly used sulfuric acid and nitric acid and is not dangerous when prepared. He wanted to wait for the alchemist to recruit the fire cotton, but now that he has set a seven-day contract, he decided to pick up his sleeve and personally end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a quill, he wrote the long-conceived idea on the draft paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is cotton, preferably a cotton yarn that has been woven and undyed. This thing has been moved back from the Duke’s House and is now piled up in the castle warehouse. . Cotton yarns need to be degreased, otherwise the grease attached to the surface will hinder the progress of nitrification. Most of the things that remove grease are well-known, that is, sodium hydroxide, also known as caustic soda. At the same time, it is also the raw material for the detergent: adding sodium hydroxide solution to the oil, stirring it evenly and solidifying it into the mold to obtain the soap for washing. Only Roland has been busy developing industrial and agricultural and confronting foreign enemies. There is no time to develop such daily necessities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how to make sodium hydroxide, the simplest thing is to electrolyze salt water. So the prince found that in order to build a new type of bullet, he must first start with a DC generator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The ashes walked along the Chishui River, and the mood was faint and somewhat low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the witches knew that her purpose was to advise the sisters to leave the border town, the attitude towards her also cooled down, no longer seeing it last night. The enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, she noticed that most witches practiced their abilities in the backyard of the castle, which shows that Roland also found ways to avoid magical phagosomes. The original plan to exchange this vital information for the good feelings of witches has been shattered. Apart from explaining the pros and cons to them separately and persuading them to leave, they have almost nothing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most disappointing thing about the ashes is Roland Wimbledon - he doesn't change much, but he has an indescribable temperament. The image of the child is out of place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this happening? He used to be an incompetent person. The first thing that comes to mind when he meets things is to escape. Don't say that he has come forward for others. Even if he does what he does, he is afraid of being responsible. I remembered the harassment, but a disgusting look made him fall to the ground in panic. Tilly heard the sound, but he lied that he accidentally fell, and blamed the five kings, why should I find such an ugly woman to be a guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
