			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the room, Efe quietly listened to Tilly's beginning and end of the establishment of the blood, and the real purpose of Heidi Morgan. When she heard that Anne was handed over to the nobility by Tian Yan, she felt something in her heart was pinched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hetty...what is it for her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"has been punished as it should be "The ash standing behind Tilly replied, "In addition, during the arrest process, Tianyan tried to resist and also walked the same path with Herti."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What? Thank you." Effie whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fist she just clenched couldn’t help but feel a little lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the culprit causing all of this has paid the price, she did not have much feeling of ease, but instead gave birth to a sigh of relief because she lost her goal of hate. And as the only person who has not been punished, her sin is even deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that you can help the sleeping island get back on track," Tilly paused for a moment and then said, "The rest of the bloody members will be like you. They are all deceived and framed by Herti. They should not be implicated or discriminated against. The witches of the witches are a mistake in assisting the witches, but the reverse is not going to be good."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without too much hesitation, Effie nodded, "I am willing to help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably not expecting her to be so fast Promise, Tilly seems to have some surprises. "You can promise that would be great."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s okay to talk to other members of the bloody meeting about Anne and Anne’s story. Heti’s crimes will be made public to everyone.” Tilly said, “Wait for the complete eradication of the church. After that, I will send people to the wolf to search for the witches who are imprisoned by the nobility. If they are still alive, they will be responsible for saving them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any way to alleviate this sin, she will try her best Go and do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... are you okay?" Tilly suddenly bent down and rubbed her hand to wipe Effie’s cheek, which suddenly felt warm on her face. Open it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," she blinked. "I'm just a little...sleepy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The five kings looked at her silently for a long time, "Don't be too sad, take a rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the footsteps of the two men, Effie I was unable to lean back on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just a natural reaction of the body, she told herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is sad, not cowardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she misses Anne’s proof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears flow faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Roland sat at the desk and flipped through the evacuation statistics report of the staff. The candlelight swaying at the table made him dizzy - he hadn't tried to read the lights for a long time, and now he is a little uncomfortable to use. I thought that I had already brought civilization into modern times in advance, but when I arrived in Glentown, everything was returned to the prototype. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No shower, no soap, no lights... There is nothing better than when you first arrived in the town. The beginning of industrialization is only a sharp tip in the west, and there are still many jobs to be done to make chimneys and boilers all over the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put down the report, just want to blink his eyes, a pair of soft invisible hands have reached his forehead, gently press to pinch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
