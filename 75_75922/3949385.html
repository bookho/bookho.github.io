			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You got the Holy Spirit medicine?" The black hammer suddenly came to the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Holy Spirit medicine?" Tassa closed his smile and sneered, "There is no need for the church's drugs, and it can cure the infected patients." Take two small skins at the waist and put them on the table. "It is only their usual trick to blame the witches. Anyone who dies will not refute anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The black hammer picked up one of the skins in a puzzled way, swayed a few times at the ear, and untied the rope and smelled it. "No taste?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You take Going to the silver ring and the clay pot, you know if it is a real medicine," Tassa said. "The two should be in the pub."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Since I found out that I was infected, I let them hide in the basement. Now the black spot patients are easily attacked by the city people outside, and the old nest of the fingers will not open the door and let them in." Pick up the bag, "Adult, I will try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got up and left, Hill still stared at the table, a word Hair, which makes Tasa secretly shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ordinary person who lives under the sinister epidemic, should not be so calm when he hears that drugs can cure the disease. Even if you don't want to be tempted to take a look, at least you will ask a few more questions. As an intelligence officer, this watch is not qualified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can this medicine really cure the evil?" The little finger yelled, "Adult, where did you get it from?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even the little girl is more than him, Tassa drink a glass of wine, "Of course, the queen of the palace gave me, who in addition to him, who dare to confront the church? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, the black hammer came back with a silver ring and a clay pot. "Oh my God, this medicine is incredible! Just after drinking it, they were The dark spots disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, thank you for your potion," the two pounced on the floor, where the clay pot cracked the skin. Still keeping blood, "You saved our lives!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Break the wound first," Taza waved his hand, purifying the water, although it can eliminate the disease However, it is impossible to heal the wound. If the seriously injured person wants to recover, it will take at least a week or so. "It is better to thank my employer than to thank me. If this task is good, you I have the chance to get rid of the identity of the mouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"陛...No, I mean, is your employer really planning to let us sell the medicine?" Asked. Obviously, he can also realize how much income can be generated by selling special potions at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the church used this method to deceive the city people to make him feel extremely angry. If you let these god sticks do it unscrupulously, I am afraid that the whole king city It will become a cathedral, not the territory of the Wimbledon family." Tassa Shen said, "In addition, he does not want to see that there are not many living people in the big city, so the potion can never be sold expensive. Let most civilians pay for it.” He took two more bags and dropped them on the table. “A bag like this can only sell ten silver wolves.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten... ten silver wolves!?" The black hammer widened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, six of the employers who belong to me, the rest belong to you," he opened his hand. "And the potion is enough for five or six thousand people." So, you can get at least a few hundred golden dragons, even if they are evenly divided, it is not a small amount, enough for you to spend a lifetime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party’s words Looking at the ground, eyes staring at the skin on the table, seems to be thinking about how to get more benefits from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tassa is very clear about the idea of ​​these mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The syrup itself has no cost, even if it is a white delivery, there is no problem, but so many shares, relying on him alone, the efficiency is low, and it is too attractive. Attention. Giving the mouse to sell can reduce the risk, and the ten silver dragons are also the price that most city people can afford. Of course, these people can't sell at a low price honestly. Whether it is stealing a part of the sale to the inner city or handing it over to the black market, you can get huge profits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
