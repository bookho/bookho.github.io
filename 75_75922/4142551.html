			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following few days, the General Staff Department oversaw and summarized the entire torch action based on Axia’s retrospective and the search results of the ruins of Takira. . Almost every day, there are reports to Roland's desk, which are almost half-high before and after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more details are being clarified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the battles of the North Face and the Great Stones of the Tacula attack have come from the ruins of the Shenshi vein. At the bottom of the mine, the detectives found the missing part of the ore cluster—the two medium-sized shrines were cut in half, and the section was very smooth, as if it had been cut by sharps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the ability to use retrospectives is not available near Shenshi, it is likely to be related to the giant skeleton. In fact, the latter is not only a means of transportation, but also has the function of a small obelisk, which can regenerate the red fog, as evidenced by the eroded land around the remains. However, it is only one or two hundred meters away from the obelisk, which is covered by hundreds of kilometers. It still cannot be made out of nothing, and it still needs the supply of red lines to maintain it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a "sentinel point" that can move freely, its strategic significance is self-evident. The conclusion of the staff is that compared to the spider devil, this super-large carrier is a rare species for the devil, otherwise it can completely replace the role of the outpost, occupying the fertile plain before the humans have reacted. The whole territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, most of the passages behind the Takula are excavated by spiders - their ability to dig is far less than devouring worms, but Contrast the madman is still better. These passages are all from the Shenshi mine. The depth from the ground obviously takes into account the threshold of observation ability, and the preparation time is sufficient. It is never an easy task to find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because both Celine and Aisha tend to treat the giant skeleton and the spider magic as the same kind of devil, Roland also gave it a new name: Beasts, to distinguish between carrier-type enemies and other devils, plus a specific prefix, can quickly name similar devils that have not yet been discovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two carriers are currently named "Fortress" and "Spider-type Beast", the latter of which is divided into a stone throwing needle The type and type of throwing personnel, the accurate name is not only conducive to combat deduction and command release, but also more convenient post-war statistics and records. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the detailed analysis of the situation, Roland’s other focus is on the deficiencies and improvements that the General Staff Department has listed based on the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, Itis personally made a report, which is also the top position in many problems, is still a shortcoming of investigative ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the sky, in the history of human warfare, the tunnel warfare is limited by the tools of mining and cost-effectiveness. It has always been a kind of trick, but it cannot be used as a Used by conventional tactics. But this law is somewhat unsuitable in the face of swallowing worms and spider-type beasts - as long as there are enough carriers, the enemy may even dig a subterranean passage that can be used by the army in a short time, so at the foot Land has also become a dangerous area that has to be prevented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that one person alone can not only care about it, but also very uneconomical. When the eye of the magic penetrates the obstacle, the consumption will be greatly increased. Under the condition that the total magic level is fixed, the target of ten kilometers away from the surface of the earth will be monitored all day, and if it is changed to the glance, it is only one or two football fields. , shallow layers of three or four meters deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, except for the supernatural, there is a threshold for the power of all witches. When a certain condition is exceeded, the magic consumption will show an exponential rise. In the case of any non-emergency behavior, it is a waste of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This alert work must be undertaken by the First Army itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland vaguely remembers that in history there have been ways of using underground monitoring to guard against each other’s excavation and assault positions. The principle is the same as the stethoscope, with the help of sound. The attenuation of propagation in solids is less than that of air propagation, which can more clearly capture the movements of the opponent when excavating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this method is limited to tunnels that are being excavated near the position, such as Tacula, which was laid out early, and cannot be solved by listening alone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought about it again and again, only to think of a feasible method - brazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
