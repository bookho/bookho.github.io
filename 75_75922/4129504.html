			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of people in the cheers of the onlookers, like the tidal tide, marching along the Kingdom Avenue to the Long Song Fortress. The police team serving as referee and rescue also rides a bicycle and follows closely on both sides of the crowd. These alternative knights in uniforms and bright ribbons have attracted the attention of many viewers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same scene also took place at the starting point of the Changge District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a thousand people at the same time, with the same purpose, opened their legs to the finish line - not for escape, nor for life, they Unconsciously venting his physical strength, without having to worry about the after-the-fact return, this kind of unreasonable spectacle is destined to spread the reputation of no winter city to every corner of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first organized long-distance race in human history has opened the curtain in this new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister, why don't you attend?" At the finisher, Lance When he yelled at the railing, Cole turned his head and looked at Itis. "If you just try to endure, you should also get the ranking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Probably from the father who brought Lance also, the other party’s recent mood has always been good, not only the usual answer, but also the cost of being tricked, otherwise he would not dare to use this A trivial question to disturb the old sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Itis squinted and swept him. "What about getting it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey - can you not be very keen on this kind of test before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, it will not get the title of Northland Pearl, Cole thought. In his eyes, the old lady used to be a master of excess energy. During the day, he and a group of knights were in full swing. The same-aged one-handed single-handed sword could be discharged from the Castle of the Night to the gate of the city. In the evening, she was the most dazzling flower in the banquet. The wine-making and the accompanying talks were all in the air. Even after I saw Feike, I remembered her and the charm was evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she can see her in most of the North and the banquet, she has become a household name. In the past, she could never miss this celebration hosted by His Majesty the King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the family needed me to do that." Itis shrugged. "Don’t expand the influence of the Kant family as soon as possible, and the father can’t get the duke. Bit - even if I have to be like a clown, to attract the idiots of the group and to please their hearts." She said with a sneer, "You shouldn't think I like to do this?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col couldn’t help but feel a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I am just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now, I don't need to sweat back In exchange for the attention of Roland, "Fortunately, the other party did not pursue his fault, "and... I am not alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cole couldn't help but sigh, "Not...one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis looked at the screaming Lance, then looked again He, "I still have you, aren't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chill disappeared instantly, and Cole subconsciously raised his chest and wanted to say something, but he didn't know how The opening is good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Itis just smiled and moved back to the high platform. "Going well in the Executive Office, that is the biggest help for me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunting...snoring," Gould's speed Slow down, "How many roads do we have to run?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The signboard that passed by was fourteen, that is, we only ran halfway "The journey." Luo Han looked worried. "Father, are you okay? If you are too tired, we will stop and rest for a while, anyway, there are so many people behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, people who can run for more than half an hour in a single breath are rare. From the beginning to the present, there are only a handful of players who surpass them. According to this rhythm, not to mention the ranking, the smooth completion of the game should be a matter of stability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lohan is more worried about his father's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is more laborious than crossing the desert - at least the former does not limit the time, as long as the route is planned to ensure that it can be replenished from the oasis, step by step Always reach. But running is different. If you want to stay at a higher speed, your physical exertion will continue to increase, and your father has not done such intense exercise for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to give up again?" Gulze glanced at him. "Because it is not the last one?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is Loja, you will not say this, when can you like it? Like her, do everything in their power to make a goal and go forward? Have you ever thought about winning everyone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was in the past, Luohan would only Choosing silence, but somehow, he felt a suffocating rush from the bottom of his heart, making his chest uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I win? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it poisoning in Sanmei’s cup, or is the news of her wolfing public? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How else could it be possible to defeat a goddess who has gained the power of the Three Gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even the family's bodyguards can't beat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And want to sit on the seat of the Iron Crest City’s number one clan, the mad flame must guarantee ample combat power, and Luo Jia later became the best heir in the eyes of everyone, this also have nothing to say. But he chose to retreat and avoid internal disputes. Isn't it a behavior for the clan? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have you never noticed me? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s probably because of the distance from the South, or if he’s been too long, maybe there’s a little father’s dress that’s too weird, Lohan’s first The second time I argued, "I am worried about your situation! If you are not here, I have already gone to the front!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just finished He regretted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is simply ridiculing the other side dragging themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squirmed and tried to remedy the two words before his father’s anger, but he heard Gould return. “Then you are alone. "Running well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, I mean..." Rohan leaned over his head and thought he would see the other person’s angry face. Unexpectedly, his mouth was hung with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this your first initiative to reveal your thoughts?" Gould sighed. "In fact, you are right, I am really old." No matter how pretentious it is, it can't change the impact of time." He paused. "If that's the case, then leave me alone - you are really good at running long, right?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luohan slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is an old saying in the clan, anyone who has been practicing for ten years, and then stupid people will become outstanding." Gould slowly stopped, " Don't worry about me, I will walk slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clenched his fist and whispered for a moment, "I will take a step first." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait," Just as he turned, Gulze stopped him again, "put these two things on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even though Luo Jia left the clan, she was still mad A part of the flame, also your biological sister, there is any place that can help her, we should do our part." Goulds personally put the cloth headgear on his head, "Go, let the chiefs See the ethics of the Mokinsha people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
