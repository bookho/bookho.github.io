			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the castle, Roland looked at Ai Gesha. "Do you think of anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The gods of the puppet army should be researched successfully after the complete fall of Takira. I don't know much about it," she said slowly. "Just... it may not be as simple as the church officer said, at least this method." It is impossible to explain how the new pope took over the last god of the penalty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, it is very strange that the unruly gods will take the initiative to go to the wilderness. A little pause, Ai Gesha said, "The wild land in your mouth should be the fertile plain four hundred years ago. There is nothing but the ruins of the holy city. To say that they are attracted by the devil, the distance is too far." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows," Roland didn't think. "You saw it, they are flowing blue blood, with us. Nothing can be regarded as the same kind." He is not interested in what the gods of the penalty army are attracted to. God punished the military weaknesses, and how to effectively prevent divine punishment warrior impact on the offensive front in the war. After all, from the point of the spear, there is no threat to the gods in the absence of fortifications. "If the gods are really controlled by the voice, perhaps the ability to echo can..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't agree to do this," the ancient witch vetoed. "There is a lot of risk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Indeed, to be quiet It’s not a small risk to sneak into the vicinity of the controller, but we can —”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, I am not saying echo,” Aegusa interrupted his words. "I mean you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" Roland groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want the echo to be quietly close to the controller, you must rely on the fog of the nightingale, so that your side is equivalent to no protection, the church As long as you send a pure person with special abilities, you can easily kill your life," she said without hesitation. "Although you are a mortal, weak and weak, but want to defeat the devil, it seems that it still It is indispensable for the time being. So it is most important to protect yourself. We can't take any risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really can't tell you whether this is praise or 贬"Roland couldn't help but laugh out loud. "At that time, I will wear the stone of God's punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stone of God is just an insurance It is not an absolute safety barrier," Ai Gesha said bluntly. "Even the nightingale can't guarantee nothing, but we don't have a better way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" As long as I am still alive, I will not suffer any harm from my knees." The nightingale couldn’t help but show up, and I can see that Statement of Ai Gesuo quite unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope so," the ancient witch did not argue about this, but turned away from the study, but when she reached the door, she stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha was silent for a while, "I don't know if I should say this... The reason why Akaris can become a star queen, three seats First, in addition to her extremely powerful strength, her mind and means are more than most witches. Her decisions have saved the collapsed federation. Without Akaris, Takira could not support that time. Many people think that if she can be born on the eve of the first war of gods, she may have ended the war of hopelessness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and frowned. "I want to say that she is the super warrior she wants to save the witch. It shouldn’t be This is the right thing to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that the current gods are not necessarily the gods of the four hundred years ago?" Roland was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The god of warriors is not afraid of magic, will not panic, powerless, it seems that the devil has a greater advantage, but ... can not play A hammering effect. Not to mention the fact that he still needs the controller to accompany the action, and there is almost no ability to attack long distances. I think that Akaris should not have high hopes on this warrior." Aegusa sighed. "Of course, these It’s just my guess. After the destruction of Tahira, what happened to the Federation, I’m afraid only the church knows.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
