			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boiler heating system is not a complicated thing, its essence is to boil hot water, then the heat is piped to the room, and then spread out by the radiator. The carrier of thermal energy can be water or water vapor. Roland uses the latter because the upper limit of steam temperature is higher and it is more convenient to circulate. As long as the boiler is kept burning, the steam pressure generated will automatically fill the small high temperature water droplets in every corner of the pipeline, even the pump is not needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, steam heating is not without its shortcomings. The pipeline is always in a high-pressure environment. If the interface is not strong, it will easily leak or even explode. It is the skin that is open, so the quality of the installation is higher. Anna's black wire welding can guarantee the strength of the interface, plus the coating of Soroya, this shortcoming can be reduced to a minimum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Roland also installed an automatic pressure reducing valve on the boiler. The mechanical principle is the same as that of the centrifugal governor on the steam engine. When the pressure in the furnace is too high, The high-speed rotating flywheel pulls up the valve and decompresses the exhaust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last insurance is located at the junction of the boiler and the two main heating pipes. He asked Anna to engrave several grooves around the copper pipe to reduce its strength, and Cans are similar. Even if the pressure valve does not open properly, the explosion will occur in the boiler room without harming the people in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the heating system was running, the scene in the castle was completely changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy and heavy winter clothes are gone, the witches are replaced with the singles in the fall, watching a colorful girl talking in front of herself. Roland felt that his work motivation has risen by five percentage points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these facilities are all used to enjoy, or to build, an auxiliary device to create a better working environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing to do is an important project related to the future of the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to achieve artificial ammonia synthesis, reduce the dependence on saltpeter, so that the production of chemical explosives is brought to a new height, so that it can meet the needs of automatic shooting weapons Requirements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can achieve this goal before the end of the winter, it will undoubtedly put a heavy bargain on the planned spring offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland called Camo Spoel and Ai Gesha to the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you working together these days?" he asked with a smile. One person is the chief alchemist of Bianbu Town. Apart from the incomparable love of alchemy, he almost does not care about the feelings and opinions of others. One person is from the Witch Kingdom four hundred years ago. He has the pride of being a member of the highest research institution. Both of them are straight-forward. Putting together is like a gunpowder barrel. Roland is also often worried that they will have a dispute, but whether it is nitrifying gunpowder or synthetic ammonia, they must cooperate with each other, so they still have to ask the situation first. If they don't, they can only mediate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good," Camo’s first sentence made Roland slightly surprised. "Miss Aisha’s ability has helped tremendously in chemical experiments. Now I have found a stable synthesis temperature for nitrification* glycerol, and there is no problem in laboratory preparation. I am further testing the possibility of industrial production... It can be said that there is no ice cup, and this is impossible. Oh, because the work is too busy, Didn't inform you." He paused. "By the way, if you want to ask about this, can you let me go back to the lab now? I still have a lot to do."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃... Is this the case? Roland looked at Ai Gesha, who nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Kaimo’s knowledge is indeed different from ordinary people, especially the recognition of elements, and the exploration is quite similar. Our cooperation is currently very enjoyable. If you put it in Takira, he will certainly be absorbed by the federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does straight and straight sons get along easier? It seems that I am worried about one, and why is the chief alchemist's attitude towards the witch better than himself? It was simply sad... After Roland had a belly in his heart, he cleared his throat. "In this case, I am relieved. Call you, there is a new study to be handed over to you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling the word of research, Camo immediately came to the spirit, "You please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
