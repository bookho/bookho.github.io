			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the second month of winter, Barov walked into Roland’s office with a stack of books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just walking to the table, his gaze was attracted by a huge coloring page on the table. "This is... the map of the whole west ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not just the West," Roland laughed. "It also includes some wild land and hidden forests, especially this open space," he pointed. Refers to the northern part of the desperate mountain range, that is, the fertile plain in the mouth of Ai Gesha. "The area that has been detected is already nearly three sizes in the west. If it can be used, it can feed hundreds of thousands of people."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to completely eliminate the threat of the Devil's Camp, he asked Lightning and McMug to sweep the area over and map it into a map - because the McMug can now carry the cable directly Luo Ya did the drawing work and the map obtained was more accurate. Although the mystery of the disappearance of the Devil Camp is unresolved, the good news is that there is no sign of the existence of a second enemy camp within two hundred kilometers of Bianyan Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there are not only evil beasts in the wild, but what you said... terrible enemies," Barov hesitated. "Is it open to the northwest?" Too dangerous?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “At that time, the First Army should also have the power to fight against the devil,” Roland’s fingers slowly moved across the plains. "If we can't beat these enemies, the territories are built everywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the devil scouts appeared in the fascinating forest, he realized that the news was not suitable. I will hide it again. In order to avoid the panic caused by sudden exposure, the prince revealed the existence of the devil to a few high-level executives. As far as the current situation is concerned, the reaction of the people is still normal. Of course, he also slightly suppressed the strength of the other party and declared these enemies. The basic and mixed species of evil beasts are comparable, and the history of the previous two wars of gods was not revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows that he can’t stay on the mainland border for a long time, compared to the four kingdoms, the wilderness... or the fertile plains, is the place he deserves to operate. The area that is now being explored is nothing more than the corner of the entire plain. It is conceivable how vast the area occupied by mankind in the second battle of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took back his finger and rolled the map aside. "Do you have anything to report?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness," Barov nodded and spread the book under his arm to the prince. "I have already drawn up the City Hall expansion plan according to your request."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? I look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the rapidly growing territory of the area after the completion of the city, Roland follows the functions of the later generations of government. The departmental classification has developed a new framework for future management organizations. In general, the entire upper division is divided into four major sections, namely the City Hall, the Army, the Security Bureau and the Witch Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the expansion plan, the new City Hall will assume the role of the Cabinet or the State Council, and is the core institution of the entire territory. By then, the number of personnel will increase to about 500. It has six departments of finance, diplomacy, education, agriculture, industry and justice. It can also add new departments at any time according to the needs. In addition, after the unified gray castle, other cities can also set up the corresponding subordinate institutions according to the gourd painting, and hand it over to the city hall for management. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to combat personnel, the military also has an independent production department and medical department as logistical support. Each army has a general commander who is responsible for specific combat matters, and the highest power of the entire army belongs to itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Bureau is a secret agency hidden in the dark, funds are not allocated through the City Hall, members are not recorded in the file, the main function is to monitor the territory Security and official ** issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is the Witch Alliance... For this organization, Roland considered it for a long time, and finally decided to count it as an independent department, rather than spread it out, let The witch is integrated into other departments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that some witches’ abilities have evolved before and after the evolution, and they can work across multiple departments – such as Anna and Soroya, from industry to agriculture, and then Both national defense and education can play an important role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that individual witches have not arranged work for the time being, and it does not mean that they will be the same in the future. It is also a kind of enthusiasm that can effectively avoid damaging them. The book and Wendy mentioned to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
