			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, your guest is coming," the curtain was opened, a waitress probe said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please come in," Otto Rossi found a silver wolf handing to the wine girl next to him. "I haven't had you for a while." I will call you if I need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is it the hidden place you said?” The man who came in uncovered the hood and frowned and looked around for a week. “If it wasn’t for the Los Angeles guards standing outside the door, I thought I was looking for the wrong place.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not easy to ask you to show up now, naturally you can’t just deal with it,” Otto grinned. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a member of the ambassador who betrayed the trust of the Lord of the Morning, killing the guardian knight, and fleeing the Glory City with the fallen minions. Fox. Since I noticed that the party and the party had left without saying goodbye, the morning sun, Anpein Moya, was furious, claiming that it was the flagrant provocation and contempt of the gray fortune, and that it was the witch who killed the father. He absolutely did not allow himself. There is such an evil presence on the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Otto knows more than this. For example, while Anpein searches for the witch while sending the Knights’ team to chase the messenger, the order is to open the contract. Beyond 寇, other people can handle it at will, especially those witches who dare to collude with their neighbors, and one cannot let go. At the same time, Wang Cheng also launched an inventory activity. Dennis, a former businesswoman who had a close relationship with the ambassador, was taken to the palace and asked several times. Hill and others who took the initiative to stay as contacts were disappeared as if they were out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few months, the wind gradually subsided and he received the message again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the first meeting after they bid farewell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you need something to drink?" Otto patted the soft collapse around him. "You shouldn't have the chance to enjoy it?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill did not sit down, but went to the window and looked out. "Here is the second floor, the reliable back road you mentioned in the secret letter?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest son of Losey sighed helplessly, stood up and opened the soft wooden board, revealing the hollow underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Slide down from here, landing is the back garden, there are not only hidden doors in the yard, but also a dry well, you can go anywhere." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one knows about this road?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, along with this pub, both "Luo Xi's family is operating." He said, "I don't really say that you are a fox, you are still as cautious as before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I can't do this, I'm afraid I'm already hanging on the gallows." Hill pulled out a coin, dropped it along the dark road, and listened for a while before closing the board. "There is news in the future that I want to tell me, or contact them by secret mail. It is not safe to meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The confidable contact for me There is no small risk. If the information in the palace is leaked out, the first suspected by Anpein is the three big families," Otto sighed. "He is no longer the friend who had nothing to talk about." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill picked up his eyebrows and said nothing, "So, what's new in the Lord of the Morning?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He intends to attack the Hermes Church and revenge his father," said the eldest son of Losey, who slowly heard the conversation he had heard during the court meeting. "Despite the dissuasion of the minister, His Majesty insisted on this. Now Huiguang City has begun to collect food, until the end of the evil month, the snow should melt after the action, when the Royal Knights will go with the Duke of Kabu, who is in charge of the western wilderness."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said how the recent porridge money is expensive for a copper eagle... okay If the materials are rich enough, if you change to a gray fort, if the lord does not want to cause riots, he will not prepare for the war in the evil month." Hill thought, "Is there a problem with Hermes?" Otto<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto knows what the other party is saying, even though the church and the Grey Fortress are fighting in the Cold Wind Ridge, and the news of the defeat of the Holy City is heard, you can get further The information was that the two sides returned their own territory. The ministers agreed that the church may have suffered heavy losses, but it has not been completely defeated, otherwise the king of the gray castle should lead troops to the holy city to plunder and plunder - as the core city of the church, the wealth accumulated there. There must be no minority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
