			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taza walks into a pub, and the sultry and moist smell is mixed with the smell of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dim light, the men took off their tops, revealing a sweaty back, sitting at the central wine table and pouring a glass of inferior beer into their mouths. In the middle, I talked loudly with my companions around me. The exposed maid is interspersed between the wine table and the guest is filled with wine glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around the situation a little and found his goal - a small man sitting in a corner where the corner was inconspicuous, with a table in front of him A wilted wild rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa went to the bar and asked for a beer. Grab this bitter taste slowly, and look around to see if anyone is staring at the little man. The results made him very satisfied, although occasionally someone would look at the corner, but most of them were unintentional. Only one person sitting at the central table would observe the movement in the corner with the cover of the glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One-person joints, one person's care, the practice of Black Street rats, which is consistent with Tassa's cognition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Again," he shouted at the drinker, "Ice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir, the price of ice beer has doubled,” reminded the waiter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa dumped a silver wolf, "The more ice the better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raising the glass of white mist, he walked over to the little man and poured the beer on the wild rose at the table. The cold drink ran through the curled petals, and the other looked up and looked impatient. "A good wine doesn't drink, it falls on the table, what crazy are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jing Wei," Tassa smiled and sat down opposite him. "I have been looking for you for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Can prove that you didn't find the right direction," he said. "Since it's a customer... Tell me, what's the matter with me? Ask a clue, steal something, redeem a lost property, or sell it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I hope that you can spread a rumor for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not within Rose's business." He shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, as long as Jinlong can pay, you will be interested," Tassa shook her fingers. "I am not a layman, a young man. There are At the time, in order to get the prey hooked, it is necessary to artificially make some bait, and rumors are the best bait, there is no evidence, and there is no way to arrest. This is much safer than stealing things."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds very reasonable," the other person sat in the body, revealing a smile. "Have you ever commissioned Rose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I have entrusted your peers, small places. The names are not as elegant as you are, and there are not many things that can be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the business scope is too small, it is difficult to find The right business, Silver City, the competition is fierce.” He picked up the wild rose and smashed it, and then put it in his pocket. “Talk about it, what kind of rumors do you need to spread?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"News about the witch," Tassa smiled. "An organization called the Co-Assistance Society." The Westland has found the holy mountain, has got rid of the suffering of the demon phagosomes, and has obtained eternal peace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother, this news is really enough..." Pouting, "It’s really old-fashioned. Although I rarely teach customers how to lie, but this rumor has to be compiled at least to make people feel credible. Let me guess, if you are not trying to abduct witches, Then I want to kill the church. The latter will only wait for a bunch of trial troops to send you to the gallows, so I think it should be the former..." He showed a wretched smile, "unfortunately, as far as I know, I want to catch Most of the witches who are selling money are dead. Although they all carry the stone of punishment, those women are not idiots."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why not be credible? Tassa is curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An organization formed by a witch is simply the moon in the night sky. If it is true, the church will surely flock, if I am a witch, nature I won't go to that place. If it's fake, then I don't have to go. As for getting rid of the demon corpse, man, are you serious? The witch is the incarnation of the devil, this big lie is afraid of them. I will sneer at myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
