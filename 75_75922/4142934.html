			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Finkin said, there are few people in the big college, three people walk through a building, and finally in a towering courtyard. Stopped in front of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The west side wall of the flight field," Finchem A wooden ladder was lifted out of the corner and placed on the wall. "Come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode hesitated for a moment, still climbed up behind him, when The moment he turned over the wall, he couldn't help but whispered out—the west sun was just a little closer to the sea, and the ripples of the sea reflected the center of the sea into gold; the blue-to-yellow sky seemed to have a thicker layer. The clouds above the head have been extended to the sea antenna, like a ramp that slides into the sea, and the open flight below the foot is the starting point for the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea breeze blows to the earth, and instantly dispels the troubles in his chest. He can’t help but close his eyes and slowly extend his hands, imagining that he is holding the maneuver The pole floats in the air, waiting for the password to take off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The scenery is good, right?" Finkin smiled. "This is the treasure I found. The only thing I need to pay attention to is that don't fall." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinz last climbed the wall, "Call, what should I do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Of course, go there," he pointed to a row of warehouses not far away, and the Seagull that he first saw seemed to slip out of it. The tail end of the storehouse is not far from the wall, and it is only about two meters. "But you have to bring a ladder together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the narrow wall is no stranger to the three people - the usual balance training is also on the wooden bridge ongoing. After a quarter of an hour, they approached their destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These warehouses are about two or three meters taller than the wall. It is not realistic to climb directly, but the high window is just opposite the wall, just pick it up. On the toes, you can see the scene inside the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mengbu plane...Mengbu plane...ah, found it!" Finchem suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode looked at his gaze and couldn’t help but feel shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw only four biplanes neatly placed in a warehouse, but they were not covered with burlap, but were displayed in front of three people. . The smooth wings and smooth body made it difficult for Goode to look away. He was thrilled to think that he could drive such incredible things with the birds one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Cavaliers, the sky is where he should go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finkin put the ladder on the edge of the window and patted his hand smugly. "In this way, we don’t have a foot in the flight field, so it’s not counted. Violation of the ban."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I know that there is a clear loophole in this statement, Goode still couldn’t hold back the impulse, and followed the other side from the high window. The warehouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incredibly, the mood that was still uneasy, after seeing the real thing, calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After landing, the two partners ran to the nearest aircraft, and he was at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wow, this is really... no." Heinz stroked the fuselage. "It looks like metal." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, and it’s as thin as a layer of skin, you see--" Finkin stretched his fingers and pressed hard, and a small layer appeared on the surface. Small sag, "I really don't know how this is made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you are careful, just press it and you're done!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, it's very flexible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? I also try... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode is not as amazing as the two. He felt that he was being pulled by the general, and the ghost made him climb down the plane with his lower wing. There was a voice in my heart calling for him to go to the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Goode stepped into the driver's seat and sat firmly in his seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original...the world in the eyes of the empty knight, is this the case? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long straight wing on the top of the head and the support frame on both sides obscured most of the field of view, but also focused his eyes on the front. The chair behind him was wrapped in soft leather, and he even smelled the unique milky smell of the new skin; the instrument panel was no longer a circle on the board, but a pointer covered with clear glass. The joystick and pedal are made of metal. The top of the former is also covered with a layer of semi-soft glue, which is comfortable and not slippery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode gripped the hand lever and pulled it down slightly, and suddenly there was a loud noise behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very different from the wooden pole on the training platform, he feels that he is really pulling something – the trembling steel wire is passed back to him with clear feedback. Rather than the previous feeling of empty powerlessness, even as he continued to press, the joystick became more and more heavy, as if he was responding to his movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God, what are you doing?" Heinz’s voice interrupted his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃-" Goode slammed his hand, "I am just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Want to practice?" Finkin teased. "Who said that I was crazy? - As soon as I got here, I climbed into the cab quietly. Just saying good?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I didn’t hold back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure," he interrupted Tao, "Since the training is done this way, it should not be broken if you try it. But after the experience is over, hurry up, I haven't seen it yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Wait a minute," Goode said. "I just tried the lever, or did you sit in the back seat first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, what about me?" Heinz also climbed the wing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the three men rushed, the closed door suddenly heard a harsh opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodton's face changed dramatically! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heinz also panicked. "How can I come here at this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What should we do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Finkin is still calm, "It’s too late to hide!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no hiding place in the empty warehouse. The narrow seat is not enough to hold three adults. Before they climb down the plane, the outside people have entered the hangar. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay still!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a few whispers, Goode found himself surrounded by the First Army Guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain in front of the captain, the three did not dare to make any resistance, and soon fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" A familiar figure appeared in front of them - it was His Highness Tilly Wimbleton, "Is there an intruder?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unanswered by the guards, Finkin has already screamed and shouted. "His Highness, we are wrong! We are all students of the first phase, just because they are curious and want to Look at what the plane you are driving after, just sneak into it and ask for your forgiveness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that this is a ban. Gud’s heart is complaining, and this is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the information was asked, the Princess’s Highness nodded innocently. “It’s the same thing. According to the regulations, you will be punished for more than fifteen days. The confinement, and then forever lost the qualification to become an empty knight. As for the ground or chores, you can choose to go back and report to the chief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
