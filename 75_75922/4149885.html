			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father...Do we really need to do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glow On a piece of open space outside the city, Horne Quinn asked from the busy workers, asking a little dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a rectangular flat square in front of the two, with a longitudinal length of almost one kilometer and a horizontal half of only about half - since the engineering team of the Grey Fort After entering the morning sun, the new length measurement method also spread among the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are different squares in Wangduli that are made of beautiful masonry. The surface is completely paved with cement and looks gray. No color and no features. If you want to say an advantage, I am afraid that it is only convenient to repair. It takes only a week from the time to level the land to build the molding. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, the workers involved in the construction are all from the team of the Quinn family, and the degree of attention can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Horford Quin, the current morning lord, looked at him with interest and said, "What do you mean? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland’s instructions are too much," Horn said with a finger. "It’s a bridge repair and a road repair. In the big projects of dozens of miles, you have concentrated all the long-term workers in the family to do this. What about the activities in the territory? There are still several places to be repaired in the castle that have not been started yet."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course his dissatisfaction is by no means two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father’s request for the king of the Grey Fortress is too much value. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can even be described as harmless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, cement is a wide-ranging alchemy product. If the monopoly is in the hands of the family, it will inevitably bring lucrative profits. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just because Roland’s letter "Please be sure to expand its production as soon as possible", the father called the big nobles into the palace and publicized the recipe in public. . Collecting the power of the major chambers of commerce under the aristocrats, the cement factory did establish several in a short period of time, but the Quin family’s gains were undoubtedly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was the turn to build the road, the situation reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big nobility pushed one by one, and the father simply came by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the recruitment of personnel to the construction of the Gray Fort Engineering Department, the Quin family will bear the burden. This is by no means a small fee. Although the family property of the royal family of Moya has increased the family strength, it can be as fast as water. Looking at the coins in the treasury, the number of coins is decreasing day by day. It is impossible for Horn to say that it is not painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is that road construction is not equal to business investment. Jinlong, who is doing business, may exchange more wealth, but the road connecting the Mobei River to the cage mountain can What are you earning back? It is not even in the territory controlled by the Quine family! Even if you can promote business development in disguise, the cheaper ones are only the lords of the border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the current situation, what Roland wants to build is more than just the same. This is a bland that doesn’t seem to have any effect. It is proof. So profligate, the family will sooner or later encounter the dilemma of being unable to make ends meet. In fact, he has heard a lot of criticism from the internal branch of the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most uncomfortable thing for Horne is the attitude of his father to the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only did each project personally ask questions, but also often those officials of the engineering department were called into the palace to take the initiative to ask for their request. If the other party is a nobleman, the problem is that Horne can understand clearly that these expatriate "officials" are all civilians and do not have any prominent family. The father invited the civilians to talk to themselves at the same table with the respect of the king of a country. This is somewhat unacceptable to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And today, when someone hears about the Grey Fort, someone will come to Huiguang City, and the father will take the brigade to the outside of the city early, which is hard to find. Confidence - as a ruler, it is enough respect to meet in the castle. How can the royal family do this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn suspects that his adoptive father is making atonement to Andrea. After all, all these changes began after Hofford and his daughter bid farewell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
