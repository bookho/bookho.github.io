			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember telling you a month ago to close all the roads to the Kingdom of the Wolf Heart as soon as possible. Why are there still many refugees entering the country?" The woman whispered, "Even if you climb, your knight should also arrive at the border."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also know there are many refugees there!" Pinch your fists. "If you are prohibited from crossing the border, most people will starve to death on the road. There are no cities nearby, and there is no place to provide food. If the original road returns, it will take at least a week to return to the wasteland town. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which relationship does it have to you?" The other party interrupted impatiently. "They have abandoned their kingdom, whether it is hungry." Whether you are dead or thirsty, you are better off putting your attention on your father. Or, do you want to break the contract?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your kingdom? It’s ridiculous! Otto thought angrily that it was the war that you initiated that made these people have nowhere to go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After mentioning the breach of contract, Anpei apparently hesitated, and after a short while, he said, "The rest of the road will be completely closed within a week. This is the end of the line. But if they do not go through the official road, but cross the border through the wilderness and the mountains, I can't control it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, we will not Forcing you to promise something you can't do," the black-yellow woman took the porcelain bottle, drank a small mouth, and then went to the bed and bent down. The two people in the secret road widened their eyes, but couldn't see what she was doing. After a moment, she looked up. "This is fine. He will wake up in half an hour, just like before."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have to use your mouth to take medicine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Must be me," she Shrug, "Reassured, as long as you do as agreed, the Lord of the Morning will surely heal, even healthier than before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next time we come again At that time, it is after you completely close the border." The blonde woman smiled. "Don't let the sire disappoint, His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as they turned and ready to leave When Anpein suddenly asked, "You are a witch, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" The two stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The so-called must be administered by you to be effective, is it because of the magic of the witch?" He said slowly, "I can't find it other than that." Other explanations. Although it is unbelievable to have a witch in the church, everything you do is no different from the devil's behavior!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to say is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come out!" the prince shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence scared Otto and Oro, but saw several guards wearing half-body armor in the closet and under the bed. Surround the pure people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢-" The blonde woman whistle, "admirable...reckless move."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And it makes no sense," Black Yarn shook his head. "It seems that the church has not given you enough impression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not pretend "Anpein is awkward," "I do show that the gods of the warriors are incredibly powerful, but they are not here now! How many gods in the palace, how much do you think you can escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait..." The blonde woman snorted. "Is the witch we met on the road, did you arrange it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is not a real witch, but it is a common trick for rats," Anpein said as if he was venting his long-repressed anger, and said, "It can be taken away by a magic stone. Your ability is no different. Without the protection of the gods, the witch is different from the ordinary people in front of the stone. Now hand over the medicine. If you don't want to be cut off your limbs, pull out all your teeth, and make a personal medicine pot, do it now as I said!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ladies I will be very angry when I hear you," she sighed. "Not only witches are fake, but they are also ridiculed by a hairy boy. It is better not to let her see you next time, otherwise you may Will suffer a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
