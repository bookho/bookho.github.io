			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement person only catches the two swords of Brian, and the weapon is directly picked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not so much a member of the patrol, it’s better to say that it’s a mix of people, Brian’s angrily thought, except for extortion and extortion, these people do What? He and the Greyhound meticulously performed the task of the lord's account, and became a different kind of team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...but this group of wastes, this group in order to rely on the fortress, do not hesitate to ruin the town's scum to kill the gray dog, with the mean means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unforgivable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slashed his sword at the neck of a frightened opponent-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, A black shadow stabbed from the target, and the blink of an eye approached Brian's heart position. This shot was too hidden, and when he noticed it was too late to block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a hurry, he slammed the ground, his body popped backwards, and there was a sting at the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two laps, he stood up and Brian immediately put on a defensive posture. The sword sneak attack just pierced his coat and skin, but it didn't matter. The key is to pierce the sword! He didn't think any of the guys in the patrol had such swordsmanship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? You actually escaped," the man pushed away the teammates who lost their weapons and stepped forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the fire, Brian found that he did not know each other at all - he was not tall, his hands were too long, and he could almost knee with his knees. Qi Ping. The face is also strange, Brian vowed never seen this face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not a patrol person...who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although and next door There are not many people dealing with five people, but people always recognize them. This guy apparently replaced one of them and followed the team into the castle. It’s not surprising that I didn’t find it when I was in the middle of the night, but they couldn’t find it. Since they are not surprised by this, there is only one explanation. This guy is fiercely arranged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have already guessed the answer, why bother me?" He smiled indifferently. "You are going to die anyway."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mom, he hurt me!" The fierce hate said, "Viper, hurry down his hands and feet, I will slowly let his blood go!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, Mr. Hills, I must give priority to the task of the countess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The voice is not falling, the guy called the viper is deceiving himself. The angle of his shot is very different. With a very long wingspan, Brian has been struggling for a time and forced to retreat. Opportunity to counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About! Brian was anxious in his heart. After playing in the underground walkway for so long, should the people above notice it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally intended to avenge the Greyhound personally, now I only hope to hold it a little longer, waiting for His Royal Highness Knight to come to encircle the group of villains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you seem to be expecting," the viper suddenly suspended the attack. "I guess I want to wait for the prince to save you? Unfortunately, this stone The castle is different from the pubs and hotels that you usually find. The houses that are built out of the wooden shelves will creak when the people are looking for fun. Just close the door and you will yell at the throat and you will not hear it. Any movement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian is said to be in the center of the idea, can not help but see, and the snake is waiting for this opportunity. He kept his sword in a downward position to paralyze his opponent, and the other hand lifted slightly, triggering the trigger of the handcuff hidden in the sleeve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long index finger only shot from the cuff, Brian only heard the creaking of the string, the arrow has fallen into his Lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbearable severe pain suddenly blew open on the chest, and Brian threw a long sword at the venomous snake and turned and ran back. But the blood leaking from the lungs quickly poured into the trachea, making it difficult for him to breathe. Not far from how far, Brian was knocked down by the door, and one fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me come," he gnashed his teeth. "I want this guy to know that I will stab my end!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake face flashed a cool color, but eventually Or let it go sideways. "Do a good job, don't forget our business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully Brian's hair, whispering to him "Trust me, you will die very painfully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian wants a spurt of blood on the other's face, but the whole body is like a stream of water, He knew that he didn't live long enough. The regrets of the past have come to mind, such as wives who have not yet met, such as the dream of knights that cannot be realized. But the most regrettable thing is... I can't take revenge for the Greyhound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, what is that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blinked and there was a woman sitting on the front box, although in the dark light, the other person’s appearance was not clear, but the exquisite figure Explain that she is without a doubt a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, this is an illusion... When he fell into this room, he didn’t even see anyone inside. Is it that the god of heaven heard his complaint and deliberately created a fantasy to comfort him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you are playing so much on other people’s sites, and you are planning to kill people in front of me, I’m afraid it’s not appropriate?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright only felt fiercely shaking his hand and slammed his hair. There was a sound of weapons squirting around, and a few screams and sounds, "Who are you!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their response is too much...etc. Next, Brian thought with sorrow, isn't he seeing the illusion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I am here," the woman jumped from the barrel and bent over to take the dust on the robe. In the dim light, Brian saw a strange pattern embroidered on her robe - three juxtaposed triangles, and huge eyes in the center. The outline of the eye shines a little golden light under the illumination of the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you? The mouse that slipped in from the gutter?" Her voice was crisp and sweet, but without any feelings. This is unreasonable... no one should be so calm when seeing a murder scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake also realized this, he looked dignified, slowly wandering to the side of the other side, suddenly lifting the sword straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman didn’t even turn her head and waved her hand in an understatement. The viper didn’t even see her weapon, only a cold wind swept through his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scream, fierce and unrecognizable eyes wide open, he saw the snake rushed up and quickly retreated back, the original part of the sword has been Empty and empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His arm fell with the sword and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear suddenly caught the fierce throat, others may not know, but he is very clear about the bottom of the snake. "The shot is hot and sinister." This is the evaluation of the Earl. The person who can be seen and recruited by the count can't be underestimated. Even Brian can hardly spend half a quarter of an hour under his attack. But now, he was accidentally hit by a woman and cut off the entire arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are still doing something, killing her!" the snake yelled at the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian’s sight of excessive blood loss began to blur, he heard cluttered footsteps everywhere, weapons crashing, and... human body fell The muffled sound. In the end what happened? He tried to turn his eyes and look forward -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol captain then saw a picture he could not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of the woman is like a ghost, she wanders in the encirclement of the crowd, and it is hidden. Every attack will penetrate the enemy's vitality. Rather than killing, it is better to say that in dance, he has never seen someone who can wield the weapon of murder so rhythmically, and the sword shadow flies up and down, drawing an incredible trajectory. The people around are in comparison, but they are clumsy clowns. They retaliated in vain, and then fell in vain... In the end, only one of them was left alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
