			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Assembly is held in the General Assembly Hall in the nursing home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as they are official martial arts, they have basically received invitations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Roland noticed that there were only three hundred people present on time, which is lower than the number of people registered in Prism City. In addition to members who were seriously injured and eroded by erosion, it was apparent that after the erosion broke out, some people retired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these people are likely to be wild martial artists who have just joined the club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia expressed strong dissatisfaction with this kind of behavior, thinking that they simply insulted the natural power of awakening in the body, waiting until the demon people completely overwhelmed humans, they The end will not be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland comforted her with two sentences, but he knew clearly that this was also related to the loose system of the association. After all, the dream world is a modern background, and the martial arts association cannot. Forced to tie the martial arts home to itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the conference is basically the same as he expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guardian Rock is a concise explanation of the troubles encountered by the Association today. Since the invasion of Prism City, there have been people who have attacked the awakened in various places. report. Although there is no clear evidence, the new enemies that can be eroded seem to be able to instruct the demon to kill them, which means that the battles on both sides will enter a new stage. The martial arts family will organize the crusade against the demon, and they also begin to systematically eliminate the martial arts, which is undoubtedly extremely unfavorable for the person who has placed the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, he suggested that the site be the permanent base of the martial arts before the prism city returned to normal, whether it is a formal member or a newly awakened newcomer. Move in here to avoid being attacked by the enemy. In addition, he also hopes that those who have not responded to the invitation of the association will recognize the critical situation as soon as possible. In this inevitable war, only unite together to resist the disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the effect, this approach of uniting as much as possible to unite the power is a political perfect score. Roland believes that after the news of the conference is released, there should be some hesitant wild martial artists returning to the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you can get everyone back, you have to watch the situation after the fight, if the association can not get the upper hand in the battle with the demon, I am afraid More people will be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once confidence is shattered, it is difficult to erect again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, the next thing that the Rock announced was the counterattack plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the president of the association has dispatched martial arts homes in other cities to support Prism City, and the shortage of staff will soon be alleviated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that the martial arts conference is held normally, but it will become a trap that attracts the demon to attack. This program has been approved by the association's top management and the government. As long as the enemy dares to show up, waiting for them will be the vengeance of the guards and the hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the association will also launch a parade system to prevent the demon from attacking innocent ordinary people to divert attention. To do this, we need to divide the martial arts into an array and arrange their own defense zones so that they can arrive and support as quickly as possible not only in the event of an accident, but once the intelligence agency finds the hiding place of the enemy, the team can immediately start the containment and Intercept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial counter-attack plan can be described as a law-abiding one. In the stage of lack of intelligence, it can only be based on prevention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the group has a certain degree of freedom, in addition to the team leader, the team members can choose their own, which makes the lobby a lively event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland naturally does not want to join any team. In a sense, he is an army alone, and does not need others to intervene in his magic core. Plunder plan. Fortunately, there are not many people who know his name, and he is basically in a state of no one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Fiji came to him in the cold, he sent an invitation to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, as a well-respected and hot star martial artist, she only invited two people at the entire conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
