			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joint...annihilation? I always felt that this word was out of place with the rule of law society. Roland took a sigh of relief. "It sounds like a big deal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not what you think So complicated," Garcia seemed to see his thoughts. "This kind of task has been done several times before. It is nothing more than the association has mastered enough information about the demon, and decided to kill them all. Compared to hunting alone or Suddenly encountering the attack of the demon, the task of preparing and taking the initiative in advance is much safer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you participated?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃-" Garcia slightly stagnate, "I just heard from the master. I was not qualified to accept the joint annihilation mission for the first time. This is the first time." She paused and stared down at the coffee cup in her hand. "Maybe you don't care about this, but I still have to make it clear... When you get the hunter license, your position is already above me." The reason why the association let me inform you is because when you joined the club. It's still short, there may be a flaw in the handover, and that's it. If you don't think it's right, then I will go back and tell the association-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, that's fine. Roland quickly interrupted. The purpose of joining the martial arts association at first was to solve the mystery of the power of erosion and nature. The murderer was also trying to earn money to support the family, and basically wanted to organize things like radiance and fever. I never thought about it, let alone become a regional leader. "Since you introduced me to the martial arts family, take responsibility and understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiacia snorted and looked up After he took a while, he laughed and said, "What is responsible for you? You are really strange... obviously want to be lazy and cheeky, but I always feel that I am taking advantage of it." On what to say, her look is a lot easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know it," Roland shrugged. "Talk back to business. Who else, besides you and me, will join this action? We Who is the target to be dealt with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to avoid leaks, this information will generally only be notified after everyone has arrived." Garcia took a swig Coffee, "But I have heard that some martial artists who represent the new faction are also among them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the association is not a piece of iron inside, he nodded," So what is the time and place of collection?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At 6 o'clock tomorrow, the location is in the southern suburbs, I will send the specific location to your mobile phone. You can do it yourself. Going, you can also take my car to go -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will do it alone." Roland said quickly. If you take a car with her, how do you bring a witch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiasia grinned, "With yours." Then she waved to Felice and got up and handed me a note, "I am Roland's neighbor, who lives in 0827, if you are in trouble in the city... I mean, anything that goes against your wishes, you can call the above... I am happy to help."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice blinked, "Thank you...thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're welcome." She smiled Pat the other's shoulders and waved toward the door. "So, see you tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a string of wind chimes, Garcia’s figure disappeared Behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a good person." Felice lamented, "Your Majesty, have you decided to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the association has named it, the push must not be pushed, so pay for the hunting license." Roland did not think that "anyway, the participants are not only one, but with a little attention, There should be no dangers. It is not bad to have such an event occasionally." After all, the monk is also part of the decompression, and he also has a witch as a helper, it is difficult to think of problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will inform Master Pasha to replace a group of fighting witches to assist you." Felice squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some registration and simple screening, the peers will quickly determine - - Still the first four witches to enter the world of dreams: Felice, Farn, Spirit, and Grace. Their ability to cover and conceal is well suited to this behind-the-scenes support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the map, the destination shows a highway service area for the outskirts. Undoubtedly, this is a meeting point for a temporary decision, which is convenient for everyone to arrive and will not attract attention when changing vehicles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The martial arts associations considered it well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when he entered the service area, he found himself wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of flashy cars in the parking lot, and there are passers-by from time to time to watch and point around. More exaggerated is that there are several groups of people gathered on the side, the screams of excitement come one after another, and its posture is no different from chasing stars. At first glance, it is known that a star martial artist is recognized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lolo, look here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you take a photo with me? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to shoot an advertisement here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Didn't make it to be the runner-up of the last conference?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, he smiled at me! So handsome! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, are you guys really doing the task? Roland silently rolled his eyes, just stopped the van and saw Garcia walking towards him." Come.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Attention hidden. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understanding," Yan En summoned the "No Light Curtain" and put the three people in the back seat together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland got off the train and said hello to Garcia, "Sure enough, you are faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I said, you are now a person with a hunter license. Why do you want to open this... ruined stuff?" Garcia said. "I know you like to act low-key, but... this is already It has nothing to do with low-key, it can even be said to be shabby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there?" He said, "I don't think there is no more convenient home. The car is gone. Whether you go to the supermarket or go to the market, you can drag back several people for a month's meals at a time. Other cars can't do this." Of course, the more important reason is that you never know what a van can do. How many beaters are loaded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Garcia seems to have accepted this statement with some helplessness, "If you don't mind other people's eyes."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Roland smiled indifferently. "The guys with sparkling faces on the face are also the martial artists who participated in the operation?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but this rude words don't say to anyone other than me," Garcia glanced at him. "According to the time of entry, they are your predecessors." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Divided by position?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's harder to say--because In the eyes of the insider, you are now a representative of the old school.” Garcia sighed. “If there is a chance to make you ugly in the mission, I think they will not miss it.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that the martial arts will be like you, to save the world." Roland said, "Right, you should belong to the new school? Come with me so close. "Do you have a question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not everyone cares about the old and new," Garcia didn't have a good air. "And, aren't you responsible for me?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's right," Roland couldn't help but smile. "Then it will work for you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, as a predecessor, let me introduce you to them briefly... but some people you should have seen at my father’s party, so I will only say the three most important people. "Good." Garcia raised an eyebrow at the center of the crowd. "Luo Hua, a well-known martial artist, a skillful player, is powerful and has many fans. The tenth place of the last martial arts conference is also the city. The best result. Although he debuted earlier, but this year is only 22 years old, this is already a remarkable achievement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
