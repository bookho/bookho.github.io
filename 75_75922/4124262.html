			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with Lucia’s adult days, the promotion of lightning is delightful, but it also brings some trouble to Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there someone injured in the neighborhood last night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, after listening to Barov After the report, he could not help but pick an eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, your majesty..." The other side of the phone came with a complaint. "A bad luck is going to the toilet, and the result is exploded." Frightened and folded my legs, and two guys rolled down from the bed and broke their heads. In the morning, the City Hall came to a large group of panicked congregations, asking if the Winter City was attacked by the devil or the evil beast. The people below took a lot of effort to persuade them. Your Majesty, can you tell me before you happen in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even through the receiver, he can imagine the other person's sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the boss himself was also scared, and the hardships of staying up all night until dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the injured now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sent to the hospital, save your life There is nothing wrong with it, but the people are still talking about it. There are people in the central square who are watching the publicity boards and other announcements - this must be caused by the ability of the witch. If you inform me in advance, I will not be in the aftermath. I am bothering you with small things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but things related to magic are inherently difficult to predict, and this is not to distrust you." Roland calmly said, "The announcement said that I am studying new weapons. I will have a similar phenomenon in the future, so that everyone should not panic. In the event of an enemy attack, the warning will prevail. Yes, those injured, The medical expenses will be paid by the City Hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following...Your Majesty." Barov succumbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head helplessly and then hung up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, the boss always has a feeling of getting more and more sticky recently. Although the government affairs are handled well, this kind of "Your Majesty, Chen is dedicated to you." With all the light and heat, you can't disappoint the singer." The tone still makes him goose bumps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the conversation with the North Pearl is much more profitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know where she is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting distracting thoughts, he looked at the desk and stood with his lightning bolt, asking like a smile, "You should have heard it just now." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜..." The little girl was frustrated. "Your Majesty, I am wrong, please punish me for two sets of exercises."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland turned his gaze to the wheat stubble above her head, and the latter struggled to open his eyes and pretend that it was not his own, "咕-"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the members of the expedition were intimate, in the face of the mountain of comprehensive exercises, Mai Hao decided to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally couldn’t help but laugh out, "Haha... Ok, lift your head, this is not your fault - after all, I agree with you. To fly, the responsibility should also be borne by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, really?" Lightning suddenly raised his head and his eyes sparkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, you don't know that doing that will cause damage, plus the loss is not big, and the exercises will be exempted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the flight route was moving towards the desperate mountain range, her impact on the residential area was very limited - except for the partial cracking of the window glass of the castle and the diplomatic building, other buildings Basically intact. When passing above the kiln area, the lightning has climbed to a certain height, and its impact is further reduced, making it difficult to cause damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, you are... great!" She seemed to have recovered all her vitality in an instant, and McMug also opened her wings with relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
