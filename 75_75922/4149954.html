			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the impossible thing quickly became a reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big bird circling around the concrete plaque and lowering the height, Horne can already see the driver on the probe. The size of the man-made object is bigger than that of the carriage. He can't understand it anyway. How does the heavy thing float like a bird in the air? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others have the same thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the iron bird roared across the square, even many workers fell down and made a prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is a miracle, I am afraid it is just that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your sister Andrea is on top of it," said Horford Quin, "and what she mentioned in her letter." The departure date is yesterday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horn understood the meaning of the word "yesterday" for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of reaction, he felt that the cold hair behind him had stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand miles away, one day is coming? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, this tipping point no longer exists" - the father's words reappear in the ear, until now, he understands how ridiculous his previous thoughts are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artificial iron bird fell off the ground one by one, and when Andrea walked off the cockpit, Hofford couldn’t wait to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dust-washing feast prepared for the Grey Fortress is held at the Castle Royal Palace. Although no nobles were notified, the news that visitors came down from the sky quickly spread throughout the Glow City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many people who have noticed this extraordinary scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch, Horford finally found a chance to get along with her daughter alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is gratified that this time the other party is at least willing to call him a father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you leaving in the afternoon?" Howard was quite reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before the sun sets, we must rush to the border of the cage and meet the First Army." Andrea nodded, "If this is not taken into account It was the first cross-border flight for everyone. The Seagull should have arrived in one day - in that case, there would be no time for meals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day Cross the two kingdoms! Even though he had already learned of this incredible delivery vehicle from his daughter's past reply, it still made him feel shocked. Although the lesson learned that Horn didn't recognize the change of the Grey Fort, he couldn't actually go anywhere. After sighing, Hofford secretly touched his chin. "Are you actually deliberately making such a big move?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia finally There was a smile. "Do you see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always feel that the plane does not have to hover for so long," Horford said helplessly. In this way, I am afraid that people in Nancheng District have heard the roar of it. Of course, it is an excellent reminder to the aristocrats who have some restlessness in the near future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is only one of the considerations, and the other is to appease the people." She shrugged. "I heard that the devil's beasts have also been found in the morning, if they can let the residents know that the Grey Fort Army also has flying capabilities." If you do, panic will not spread so easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a multi-pronged approach, is that Northland Pearl coming out?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s Your Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the name of the princess Bridon parents, Horford noticed her daughter's eyes unconsciously reveals a wave of feelings of pride, as if in general are truly proud of. It seems that she really made a good friend in the winter without a winter, Horford thought. He nodded and changed the subject. "Right, have you ever thought about inheriting my position?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
