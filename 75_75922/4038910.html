			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not like imprisonment, Isabella thought, if you don’t look down on your wrists and your feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since telling them that the cage built by the stone of God's punishment is invalid for her, she was transferred to a normal bedroom guarded by the guards. After moving to the west of the gray fort, her "cell" did not change much, neither wet nor cold, nor rancid dirty water. In addition to a bed and a bench in the empty room, there is a small compartment for the toilet. The windows were sealed by iron bars, but they did not prevent the warm sun from coming in. In general, they were much better than the secret prisons of the shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella originally thought that he would suffer some "normal" prisoners of war, especially the superior appearance of the witch, it would be easy to attract extra embarrassment, but what is the result? It didn't happen - there were people guarding the door at all times, but no one touched the room in the middle of the night, and there was no humiliation and beating. They almost never said a word except for the daily delivery of meals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federation witch who claimed to be from more than 400 years ago would often come to see her, accompanied by a blonde witch shrouded in the shadow of a hood . No matter what they ask, Isabella will answer the truth, even she will come to the two to come to the paper and pen, and when she has nothing to do, she will copy some of the secret history or devil literature she saw in the temple collection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no torture torture that she expected during this period. It can be seen that the blonde witch is very interested in finding her trouble, but after answering the question in detail each time. The other side was cold and left, which made her quite puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella certainly does not think that this group of witches are naive enough to believe what they say, from the reaction of the two when interrogating, at least one person can Check out lies. Is it necessary for a blonde witch to wait for herself to lie before she can do it? This is also the place that confuses her – there are countless excuses to punish her, or there is no need to find a solution, why bother? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the days passed, her heart sank every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been almost two months now. Why did Roland Wimbledon never appear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer may only be two, or the king has not yet awakened, or the other party does not intend to come to see her. No matter which one, it is not good news for Isabella. Perhaps when she confessed everything she knew, waiting for her was to pronounce and execute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she is willing to give everything to fight against the devil, there is no complaint about this result, but waiting for the day when death is approaching will still make her feel exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella sighed and dragged her to the bed, lifted the quill, and clumsily spread a new piece of white paper on her legs - Writing the things she remembered earlier, she should be able to liberate earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, footsteps sounded outside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is a little messy, obviously more than two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella’s heart trembled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was pushed open, she put down her pen and turned her head and found that in addition to the two common witches, there was a gray-haired man. If the intelligence is correct, he should be the four princes of the Wimbledon family, and now the king of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland. Wimbledon woke up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still come here to pronounce her judgment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabella stood up and gave a slight ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you wouldn't come to see me." She said with a calm look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the Isabella that made me wear the stone of God's punishment. It's not that I want to deliberately drag it to the present, just because it was done. A long dream, only woke up not long ago.” The calm tone of the other side surprised her, and the content surprised her. “In the dream, I killed the battle with the pure, and finally won the victory, but Not as she said, the winner wins everything – whether it is knowledge or skill.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
