			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prius Desa has a very good time in recent days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience that worked for the Elk family seemed to be a dream, and it has become increasingly blurred, and the skills and training of the Cavaliers have long been left behind. The belly is also getting better and better. To this end, he bought the clothes again, and replaced them with more loose cloth pants and silk short robes, which is convenient for action and without losing the style of "noble" - even though he knows that there is no real in the territory of His Majesty. noble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Cavaliers’ career is not a real dream, the proof of the bright armor in the living room. The strange thing is that when he was the elk knight, he couldn't understand the hyperthyroidism, and even wanted to sell them to the blacksmith. However, after turning his head to work for his majesty, he felt that the thing became more pleasing. One of the big hobbies to stay at home is to hold the children who are still learning the language of the teeth, and to fight against the armies and those who are "rejuvenated". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just in these stories that Prius is not mentioning the Duke of Ryan, as if he was loyal to Roland Wimbledon at first, an impeccable The big loyal ministers in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the town hall, his career can be described as climbing, catching up with the rapid increase of the population of the winter city, the expansion of the chicken and duck breeding area in the north of the city It has now become an extremely large poultry factory. Yes, he felt that the farm he had created was not much worse than the factory that produced the machine. Since he slammed the word, he immediately hanged the plaque to the door of the compound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The factory that is no longer in this winter city has sprung up and has become the most popular vocabulary of the City Hall. He naturally cannot fall behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the number of employees is as high as 100, and the total number of chickens and ducks is nearly 10,000. The feed and hoe that are eaten every day need several baskets to be loaded. I didn’t even think about it before. As for others calling him "chicken and duck knight", he not only did not care, but he was happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the work is on the right track, Prius is also free - the first batch of apprentices have learned to distinguish between male and female, how to feed, screen chicken, etc. In addition, it is also possible to train new people by the way, without him having to personally do it. The chickens that the poultry are most afraid of encountering can be dispelled by the witch called Lily. It is okay to think about how big the field is. He only uses planning for the week, and the statistics are given to the Minister of Agriculture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the knights who were captured with him, except for individual diehards, mostly did well. For example, his boss, Sene Dali, the original gallant, has become the minister, and he is the best one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xiao Xiaochen was promoted to a middle-level teacher, and his salary was almost the same as him. It was just that when chatting, film. Silt seemed to say that he had other plans and would not Has been a teacher. I don't know where the former star knight will go after the job, but I don't think it will be too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Halong, Valsa, Kazan, etc... either continue to be a teacher or open a shop, and he will be in his spare time. These old acquaintances get together, talk about family, or talk about work, expecting the future. However, not everyone is convinced of the sorrow, such as Halong is very dissatisfied with the rules of the captive knight can not join the army, the party is always a depressing attitude. For this, Prius did not agree. Everyone knows that the firearms are amazingly powerful. They are replaced by him, and they are not willing to hand over such things to the hands of the former defeated army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for himself, he focused his attention on the annual award ceremony. According to His Majesty’s emphasis on agriculture, he felt that he would stand sooner or later. On the high platform of the square, I received the envy and admiration of everyone. I personally took over the medals given by His Majesty the King, and there are a hundred Golden Dragon awards, which is more promising than joining the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the little song came to the town hall, Prius was planning to say hello to Sene Dali and then went to the farm, but the minister stopped him. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, you are coming right, there is something to find you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is slightly stagnation "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guard did not say, only let you come first to go to the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Prius pretended to be quiet, but his heart leaped. The agricultural mobilization conference was just past, did he want to treat him like him. Prompt to promote? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
