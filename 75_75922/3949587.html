			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Lucia White’s room was full of witches . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the expression of encouragement and comfort, she felt the eyes wet and resisted the urge to cry. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t cry... It’s already shameful to cry in front of the nightingale, Lucia tells herself in her heart, and her sister is watching here, herself Have to be a good role model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going to the town by boat, she just heard that there is a witch organization stationed here, except to want to treat the infected sister, just want to find There is no place to live in a place where you can live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she did not expect that life here is not only comfortable, but also a group of like-minded people. Since the parents died of pirate looting, she once again had the feeling of home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister is really dangerous?" Bell asked in Lucia's arms. "How painful is the magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unbearable pain, just like countless knives in your body," said the night. "There are very few witches who can support them. About ten of them are only inside." One or two can spend the adulthood safely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The little girl smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't scare her," Wendy glanced at the night. "That's all during the co-help period."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now as long as the practice is guaranteed every day, the magic is emptied before the awakening day, basically no problem," the book smiled. "I heard that Anna is still asleep in adulthood."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And there was the first high-level awakening," Ai Gesha yawned. "Tajira, which was placed four hundred years ago, will definitely cause a sensation. No witch can make an epiphany in her sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are alright," the prince looked down at her. "Although work is important, don't be too I am stubborn myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The battle of divineness is close at hand, I am too busy to do anything," Ai Gesha snorted. "If this time If you fail again, it will not be a problem to sleep forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time we will never fail," Roland confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I decided to do more things because I was optimistic about the things you invented," the ice witch gave him a blank look. "Otherwise, you thought I liked everyday." Staying in the lab?” After she turned her head, she whispered, “If you don’t fulfill your promise, I can’t find you to settle it...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you don't want to discuss such a heavy topic at this time." Wendy interjected. "Right, Miss Aisha didn't say that the witch can get a wish before the awakening day. This time. It’s the turn of Lucia. Do you have anything you want to achieve?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey...I?” Lucia saw everyone moving their eyes I can't help myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister, change the ice cream bread!" The bell eyes sparkled. "If you want ten, we are half!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy... just thinking about eating, she knocked on her sister’s forehead and looked at Roland. "Can I save this wish?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you want to do this," the latter couldn't help but smile. "But it won't be much more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One is fine," Lucia said gratefully. She can live in this small town and has nothing to ask for, just hope that the bell can live a happy life. My sister is not a witch. One day I will leave myself and form a new family with others. If there is any change at that time, this wish may help her. At this moment, Lucia suddenly felt that her empty body began to tremble, and the magic was again generated, as if it had emerged from the void, constantly pouring into the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sisters said that they don't have to worry, she still can't help but grasp the quilt. It is probably because of nervousness. She feels a little cold in her hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Relax,” Wendy took her hand and said, “Magic is part of our body.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to talk about what distracts her attention?" Lucia heard someone ask, it seemed to be Lily's voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you talking about?" The answer is the mystery month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, the results of the second exam," Lily’s voice seemed to come from a long distance. "Generally, if you talk about this, the other person will immediately think." To stop the topic from continuing, divert your attention. For example, the mystery of the month is -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't say!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, it works."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia wants to laugh out, but finds the face is very stiff, body It becomes extremely hot, and there is an indescribable sense of contraction. More and more magic is like sucking everything in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you experience this feeling in adulthood? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the score of that Lucia?" The words of the mystery month became intermittent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An average of 86 points," the prince replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have it been so high!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see that she has not stopped us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your trick failed, accept punishment!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait...you don't argue, Lucia seems Something is not right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of mystery and Lily alternately, and finally the sound of the nightingale, but she found that the words of the witches have become blurred. Lucia raised her teeth and looked up at the sisters around, but was surprised to find that the scene in front of her eyes had completely changed. Everyone's appearance becomes awkward and trivial, like consisting of countless squares - some are large, some are small, and each color is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to scream out in fear, but there is only a breath in her throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of contraction in the body is getting stronger and stronger, and it has begun to produce a burst of colic. Lucia had to hold his breath and the shadows around him have become confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the nightingale said, the pain of adulthood is far from being comparable to the previous awakening. The more it persists, the more obvious this colic is, as if it will be Cut yourself into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a strange magic has penetrated into her body - Lucia can clearly feel that this magic is not her own, it is like a The root pipe is placed on the magic vortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has not been able to explore what it is, subconsciously squeezed the magic of the body into the tube, and the pain suddenly eased a lot. Like finding a savior, Lucia constantly infused magic into it to suppress the pain of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the weird contraction subsided. The magic no longer turns, but becomes full and full, completely different from previous experiences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a blink of an eye, the line of sight returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the bell that was about to cry, Lucia patted her head and said in a dry voice, "It’s okay."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, she discovered that her body had been soaked in sweat, the cold wind blew through, and there was a bitter chill in the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
