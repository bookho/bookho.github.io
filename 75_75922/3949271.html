			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Kings are like a silver blade, cut into the back of the Garcia team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly became a mess, and many people fell to the ground when they fled, and then they were trampled to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally someone pulls out a weapon to resist, but is pierced by a skilled knight. Leading this unstoppable torrent, the front of the sharp edge is the hurricane rider Naimen Moore, the blue cloak behind him is particularly eye-catching, wherever the enemy evades. After a round of rushing, his gunpoint and long sword were covered with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefico. Wimbledon stood on a hillside farther away and observed the situation on the battlefield. At this time, the tail of the 3,000-person team was no longer neat, and the crowd became more and more dispersed, and the speed of the team’s march was almost stagnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can’t hold it for a long time, and Tiffeo thought that the team of three sisters would collapse again. These people couldn’t resist the elite knight’s. Shock, most people don't even have armor, as long as they put on a sword, they will completely lose their fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s about the same as he expected, spending an extra hour circling from the Eagle City, turning over a mountain, and then passing through a sparse forest, the Knights Go back to the avenue again. Then he ordered the team to speed up and finally caught up with Garcia's big troops at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco, according to the Duke’s teachings, divided the Knights into three groups, each group of about three hundred, taking turns to cover the enemy’s side. This will save horsepower, and there will be reinforcements on hand when there is an emergency. In order to avoid being surrounded, the knights do not have to break into the crowd, just approach the team from the side, speed up and smash, and cut off a small tail to eat, each time can cause the loss of dozens of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tactic has obviously worked. After several rounds, the enemy has killed and injured more than 100 people, but there is no way to fight back. They also want to organize the cavalry counterattack, but the equipment and training gap is too big. Compared to the Knights of the Kings, the cavalry that was temporarily put together is just a group of riders on the horse. In a photo, the "cavalry" who slammed the scalp was slain and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unilateral massacre has dealt a heavy blow to morale. Tiffco has noticed that some of Garcia’s team has begun to leave the line and flee in other directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time to launch the general attack, he thought. When the Hurricane Knight returned, he did not order to launch the next round of impact, but returned to the Knights from the hillside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, they are being washed away," Naimen wiped the sweat from his forehead, and the blood in his palm left a few marks on his face— - That is the blood of the enemy, and he has remained unharmed until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco took out his hand and handed it to him. "It’s done very well. Take a break and we will give the enemy a final blow."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the next round of the tail-breaking shock did not come, Garcia's people also realized that the moment of decisive battle is coming. The huge team stopped moving forward and slowly gathered until it was in a hug. The outermost people have raised wooden guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco sneered at it, it was just a dying struggle. There is no refusal to marry, no armor, and the flesh and blood only wants to block the impact of the Knights of the Kings. It can only be defeated. No matter whether the three sisters are still in the team at this time, they can't change the ending. Perhaps she has already changed her dress and left the group to delay the time for herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly found himself thinking wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd once again erected the flag of the clear water queen, the green pennant fluttering in the wind, and the sailboat and crown pattern made Tiffco frown. He raised the lookout and watched the enemy. I saw a woman's vague figure standing on the "People's Desk" set up by several warriors, holding up his hands and seemingly shouting something. He couldn't see the other person's appearance, but the gray hair fluttering at the head revealed her identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiasia. Wimbledon, she did not run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco took a deep breath, very good, so that the farce will end early here. He doesn't have to go to the clear water port anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
