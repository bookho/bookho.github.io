			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow outside the window has grown bigger, the snow with a fingernail size The sky was scattered and looked around, and the town was covered with them. The gray-white elf flutters in the wind, slamming into the earth, and blending with the white roof and the tree, which looks like a cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more so, the more warm Terry feels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leans on the back of the recliner, half of her body covered by a soft blanket and her feet into the fire bucket - this convenient heating device comes from Roland. Bouton's invention, the square barrel and the chair are flush, with a charcoal brazier inside, separated by a horizontal wooden fence. It's not like a flaming bonfire, it's too close to being easily burnt, and it doesn't feel much heat when it's far apart. As long as you put your feet on the wooden fence, you can enjoy the warmth of the charcoal fire at close range, and then cover the quilt, and the whole body seems to be surrounded by warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heavy snow outside the window is the setting for the comfort of the house, and the happiness generated by the comparison is impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that the witches are treated here and they are completely heaven and earth a year ago. It’s not hard to understand when they come to the town. Even her own, but also enjoy this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to her, there are Anna and Ai Gesha in the room - this is Anna’s bedroom, with a rare leisure time, Tilly has When you are empty, you will come to the door with your books and ask the other side for incomprehension. At first they were only two of them, and now there is an ancient witch who has awakened from the ruins. Anna simply moved the fire bucket from the table to the empty space of the room, and let Roland add two reclining chairs. The three people sat around the fire bucket, and their feet leaned together to study the novelty of the eye-opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, more often than they ask, Anna answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's hard to believe that such a book is from the hands of mortals," Ai Gesha closed the "Theory of Natural Science Theory" and took a deep breath. When I look at it, I feel that the world seems to be the same. All the chaos implies a law, and everything follows the same rule. Even if he is born in Takira, the Federation will inevitably include him, maybe She has the same status as the high-level witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first she also raised many questions about the contents of the book, but with Anna’s careful answer, love Gesha’s attitude towards Roland has changed dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Tilly believes that this change is only for Roland, and other mortals are probably still dull in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but sigh, I only know that this knowledge does not belong to Roland Wimbledon, but belongs to another person, a sudden appearance The person in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After these days of getting along with Hilli’s testimony, Tilly basically confirmed this statement. But this proves that he still becomes a thing that cannot be achieved. And the most doubtful thing is that he really doesn't know where this part of memory comes from, who belongs to it? It's hard to believe that memory can be completely cut away from life, at least not by yourself. As long as you think back to the knowledge of the court instructor in your mind, you will always flash the relevant clips at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where did he learn from this knowledge?" Ai Gesha said with emotion, "I thought that mortal research has reached such depth, but It seems that there is not much difference between the days and the four hundred years ago - even a little behind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Tilly shrugged. "It can't be learned from the palace anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of person was he used to be?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question has caused Anna to raise her head too.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before..." Tilly indulged for a moment, "arrogant and timid, go its own way." I don’t learn nothing, my character is bad... Probably the only advantage is that I haven’t done anything wrong with the prince’s identity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...the level of mortal? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
