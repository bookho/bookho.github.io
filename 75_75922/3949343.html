			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book stood at the door of the bedroom and hesitated for a moment before pushing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy is holding his book and sitting at the table with a sullen face, he can guess without looking at it. The book is definitely the foundation of the theoretical foundation of natural science. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book can’t help but laugh out loud, she rarely sees the other person’s expression, even if it’s trapped in a desperate mountain. At the time of the critical situation of material shortage, she still smiled and cheered up every sister. She never seemed to worry about those hardships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect a book to get her into trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't understand at all, right?" said the book, "The same is true when I first read a book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought it was a nightingale," Wendy, who heard the sound, turned her head. "...So now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It still doesn't understand "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Fortunately, you are like me." Wendy sighed. "Annan didn't say it. I didn't expect even Soroya to realize it." With new abilities, I feel that I will be overtaken by the younger generation without any hard work. I really don’t understand how His Highness knows so much knowledge and can describe the world that can’t be seen as true.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, he doesn't know much," the book shrugged. "I mean some aspects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"如??"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things such as nightingale." She pulled out the stool and sat next to Wendy. "Have you found out, her current behavior?" Become very different from before When I protect my high school, I rarely hide my body shape, even if I go out, I just wear a hood, and... I will listen carefully to the lectures at night. You should live in a bedroom with her, it should be clearer than me. Can tell me exactly what happened. "What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, nothing," Wendy shook her head. "This is her own choice."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her attitude made the book somewhat unexpected, "choose?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, just like you guessed," Wendy closed The book, bluntly said, "She likes Roland. His Majesty of Wimbledon - of course, this can be seen without guessing. The person who provided the blessing to the witch won the witch for a long time, in the journey of the Communist Youth League, such rumors It’s not uncommon.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “That’s a story written by someone else, and most of the sisters didn’t get good results.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Roland is not the same as them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book is smashed, she did not expect it Wendy, who had previously shared the same opinion with himself, said, "You know, the witch is infertile, the prince can't..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The prince will marry a The witch is a wife," Wendy said, "and he told you personally." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did she know... Was the nightingale present? The book suddenly understood what was going on, "Are you blaming me for you?" No, Wendy, I don’t say that I just don’t want to let this thing leak out, which has a bad influence on His Royal Highness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Wendy was silent for a while before she said, "I know, I am not blaming you, because I said so to the nightingale." of. Before I knew this, I thought that the sisters would not have a result, but since the prince didn't mind, would we still force to change their minds? I prefer to see what she is like now, no matter how the final result, at least she follows her own inner thoughts, rather than the nightingale's feelings of depression and depression. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out that the book thought. Although she agreed not to spread the news, she did not want to stop the sisters’ feelings and did not want to substitute them. Choices - Unlike Hakala, Wendy has always been from the perspective of sisters, cheering for their courage to stay.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, Does Your Highness know this? The book suddenly thought of a serious problem. "What if his intention is based on not knowing that the witch is infertile?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
