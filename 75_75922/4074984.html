			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I answered your question, then what is your answer?" Probably the silence was too long, and Garcia couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has returned from meditation, "Oh, I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What...?" She groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am willing to join," Roland said. "Don't you ask this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "No... I just thought you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought I was fleeing?" He chuckled. "I really accompany my relatives in the afternoon." Going shopping, why can't you trust more people? But can you apply now? The predecessor you said is the referrer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;; Garcia's expression looked a bit stiff, she stared at Roland for a long time, seems to be considering whether this sentence comes from the truth, after a while, I shook my head. "He is just my teacher, I am He came over to let him point you to the better use of the power of nature, but he will not see you again in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃, because of the reason for the loss of contract Luo Lan thought, it seems that the predecessor was not only disappointed with him, but also Garcia was blamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for applying to join the association, fill out a form," she took a piece of paper from the coffee table and handed it to him. "The name is valid." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's that simple?" Roland said in a different way, "Well, is it an organization that secretly protects the world, and does not need to conduct any initiation ceremony or ability test?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiasia sneered in a cold voice, "Do you think you are joining the ancient retreat or the Knights Templar? This is a modern society, the signature is just your informed knowledge. The right is guaranteed. The association will then check your identity and register you with new social security and benefits.” She paused. “As for testing, anyone who has awakened the power of nature is eligible to become a martial artist. The extent to which it can be achieved depends entirely on its own will and efforts. The initial tests can’t explain any problems.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔, by a person who clearly belonged to the ancient royal family That being said, I really feel that it is not very suitable...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland picked up the pen and was about to write down his name, but was stopped by the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must remind you once again that once you become a member of us, you are no longer an ordinary person." Garcia solemnly said, "You share With the rights granted to you by the martial arts association, you must also bear the corresponding obligations. You must not disclose the information of the association, and you must not betray the association. Otherwise, other martial arts will regard you as an enemy, and the subsequent disposal will not be tried by the court. I hope that you will consider re-signing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I hope that he will join the association before, when he wants to submit an application, he reminds him to think clearly, this kind of bright and upright The practice has given Roland a lot of views on her. No matter how unscrupulous and cruel the Queen of the Waters is in the Greysburg Kingdom, she has become completely different from the past in the world of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know my choice," Roland nodded and signed the name. "So, can you tell me about the erosion now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," she carefully folded the form and placed it in a wooden box under the coffee table. "It usually takes about two days to check the identity. You just submitted the application. , did not formally join the martial arts association, these messages still have to be kept secret to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well... then I changed the question, you said that hunting The demon can get a generous reward, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have explained this question clearly enough before," said the matter for money Garcia's face was a bit unpleasant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What I want to ask is not the amount, but how can I confirm after the end of the mission? Is it that I solved the opponent?" Roland shrugged, "Hunting 堕When you are a monster, you can’t bring your own shooting equipment, or invite another martial artist to watch it on the side? Or do you plan to use the classical method to settle the head?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
