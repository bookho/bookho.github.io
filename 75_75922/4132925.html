"The embers of a church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Joe was taken down, the pro-guards immediately called the Glory City Envoy and repeated the matter from beginning to end. ——He is not worried that the three people will have an attempt to treasure. After all, no one knows its real use. If it is a rare treasure with powerful power, it will not be possible to flow out from the dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Helping not help is something that is not up to me," Sean didn't think. "I got the order to find the whereabouts of the treasure as much as possible. Now It’s hard to have a seemingly credible clue that naturally has to be further confirmed. As for what action to take, it will be decided by the embarrassment.” He paused and looked at each other. “So, what good plan do you have? "Mr. Special Envoy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army is unmatched, but there must be an enemy. Searching for the spies hidden in the dark is not the soldiers. Director, this kind of thing is undoubtedly handed over to the three major families to do more appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be honest, I hope I have never heard of this," Marley shrugged. "If it weren’t for the church, Queen Quinn would not be driven out. Morning, maybe it’s already my older brother’s wife... I’m coughing, but since you opened your mouth, I can only help you. Although there have been a lot of people in the town recently, I want to find a specific class. The group is not difficult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Specific groups?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, in the cage If the mountain can't be overtaken, the nearest road from the wolf heart to here is the sea road - the harbor city in the northeast of the town of Thorns, Coral Bay." Mart said with a finger, "From the east, the number is ten. Fifteen, perhaps a team with a wolf-hearted accent or a dress style, can be narrowed down to two or three batches immediately after screening according to these conditions—up to no more than five batches.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the big city in the east...has only one Coral Bay?" Sean thought. It is like the people from the east to the winter city may come from all over the gray fort, but when they arrive from the west without the winter city, only the devil is left. "Wait to find these people, and then buckle them up and interrogate them again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It means that." Marley nodded, "and the spy you are looking for." There are nine out of ten in it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is this problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is there a better understanding of the town than the local mouse? The problem that can be solved by giving money is usually not a problem." Malr smiled and said, "In order to show the sincerity of the three families, this cost It is up to the Tokat family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suburb outside the town of Thornthorne Inside the house, Hagrid, the steward of the Count of Dagong Island, was impatiently driving the mosquitoes around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This damn broken place, even the breathable account can not be found, he was annoyed to think that the summer has not arrived, the flying insects, wait for two more In the month, isn’t it that you can’t treat people at all? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, until now, why the ritual Rubik's Cube shines, there is still no clue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not even sure if the king of the Grey Fortress is actually coming to curse the treasures in the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See what the other party has done during this period? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information collected by the team, the Grey Fort Exploration Team is a thorny town that arrived two months ago, and then it is a mountain road repair, and it is also a death row. There is a posture that I am afraid of the world. The temples on the mountainside were also dug by them. Every day, bricks and stones were transported from the mountains and placed in an open space that was guarded at all times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all this is to find a treasure that may be buried, it can still be said, but the fact is that the attitude of the gray castle to the stone seems to be more eager than the treasure Much more. He had observed the open space far away. After the masonry that was transported from the temple was evenly aired, it would be loaded with a carriage to the Coral Bay to the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also tried to steal a few pieces of stone from the port and ordered him to bring it back to the Count of Lorenzo. However, as he expected, the rituals did not regain the legendary power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to the reaction of the ancient treasures must be something else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, the person you are looking for has already brought us," suddenly one of his men opened the curtain and reported to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let him come in," Hagrid quickly tightened his bow tie and sat up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man who looks like a villager is pushed into the house, he Falling to the ground, carefully raised his head. "Adult, my name is Naf. Do you want to go up the mountain? As long as you don't cross the peak line, I can take you anywhere-"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I heard that the Grey Fortress first came to the cage, the guide was you?" Hagrid interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes...adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagri directly threw a small bag in front of him. "There are twenty golden dragons in it. As long as you can say something that interests me, it is yours." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When, of course, adults, I must say anything!" Naf excitedly responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First tell the story at the time, don't miss every detail." Hagrid glanced at the person under his feet and leaned back on the chair. Said up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Naf told the group that he climbed the caged mountain, he suddenly opened his eyes. "Wait, what did you just say?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Miss witch named Achima--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, the last sentence! "<<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coin?” Hagrid asked. “What kind of?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It looks ordinary, neither like a silver wolf nor a copper eagle.” The husband thought about it, "Yes, there is no pattern on it. It seems to be just a polished sheet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The witch has been holding it? Hagrid felt that he had faintly caught the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most of the time." The guide suddenly realized, "Listen to you, I think of it, that team is in the direction of travel." The witch is the main one, and every time the turn, the witch will put the coin in front of her eyes, as if gazing at something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, really and this group Heterogeneous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hagrid clenched his fist. "The witch named Akima... Where is it now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I don't know," Naf shook his head again and again. "She left the town of thorns in a few days. Is it probably... going back to the gray fort?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only a few days, then the other party must not be in the cage before the departure, but the reaction of the ritual Rubik's Cube did not stop, that is, ... the coin was left here? Hagrid’s heart is fast-paced, and I’m afraid it’s not a coin at all, but the “key” that the King of Graysburg has found out from other ruins. Since it’s not the same, the custodian must be the leader of the exploration team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These intelligences have already been explored. The two highest-ranking players in the Greysburg team are Commander Sean and Special Envoy Mare of the three families. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the second generation of aristocratic family, a king’s guardian seems to be more likely to be tempted—most of the castles in the world are often conquered from within. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to open a breakthrough in him, how many golden dragons do you have to prepare? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
