			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the artillery bombardment, the church army became chaotic, the neat lineup gradually separated, and the warrior who was not affected by foreign objects began to accelerate and marched. The army is behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, lightning noticed a strange sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sergeant dressed as a priest quickly passes through the winding mountain road from the rear, and his body flashes with a striking yellow light. Wherever the yellow light went, it has already collapsed. The ranks of the Judges have re-stabilized and marched forward with the guidance of the rider. This time, they are no longer lined up neatly, but scattered, so that the subsequent grenade did not achieve the original fruitful results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a pure person! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is preparing to call two artillery pieces in advance to strike the area where the church pures are about to pass, and the screams of the wheat stalks come from the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning reflexive tall figure, up and up More than ten meters, a group of locusts passed under her feet like a taupe cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the air, the mosquitoes twisted together and formed a vague human form. "The fallen wild species, dare to confront the church, you are looking for death." "!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mc茜, continue to guide the artillery!" Lightning pulled down the windshield and pulled out the pistol to point to the swarm. "Killing the compatriots makes you feel so honorable?" The damn thing is that you are right!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy’s figure entered Danny The vision is different from the last time. This time they are several times more numerous. The gray mountains are filled with the brilliance of the armor, and the sacrificial samurai does not take the tactic of slowly propelling the shield, but the beginning. It entered the stage of full sprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the enemies rushing through the mountains, he felt a torrent of momentum, and he couldn’t help but secrete the sweat. Become sticky. This kind of posture, he only saw on the wall of the demon moon - thousands of evil beasts ignore life and death, like a magical impact on the city wall, anything that is in front of them will be ruthlessly shredded. Now, the First Army is encountering an enemy that is far more powerful than the Beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Danny didn’t have the fear, the evil beast couldn’t break through the low stone wall because of the bloody militia group on the wall – and now The army of the church will also be blocked by the flesh-and-blood defense line composed of the First Army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, the woman he wanted to guard was behind the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I entered the trench in the morning, Danny saw the familiar green figure. She turned her head and smiled at him, even though she knew it was just polite. Regards, but the smile is still like a blooming flower bud in the bottom of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect her to come down with Roland on this battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, he will not let the enemy break through the line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, after violating the military discipline, the Axe adults fired him out of the precision shooting team, and now the weapon held in his hand was also changed back to the runner rifle. . Otherwise, he has already given these gods a fine color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They crossed the 300-meter line!" The malt still reported the distance as the protector did, "Beware of the enemy throwing a spear!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can see," Danny patted the head of a small man, "Take care of yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Malt is considered to be the one who has been afflicted by him. After the injury healed, the commander downgraded the malt to the ordinary Musketeer on the grounds that he did not discourage the archer from obeying the discipline. However, because he was an accomplice, the young man was not fined for one month. Go to the disaster of confinement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that this time the enemy’s offensive is too fast, and the four-machine guns have not completely suppressed the charge of the gods, plus the dust on the ground. The smoke from the field guns and the intertwined firepower network showed several loopholes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two hundred meters line, throw a spear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lone down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All give me Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cry in the trenches. Danny blew five rounds of bullets and then fell to the ground, not forgetting to replace it. The nest of the bomb. After waiting for the spear, he climbed up and pulled the trigger to the nearest enemy -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this distance, the power of the revolver was no better than the new one. With a low number of weapons, Danny could almost see the expression of the sorcerer's face without a wave, as if the surrounding gunfire and gunshots were completely unrelated to him. Until the bullet penetrated his chest and neck, and the whole head flew out, he shivered and stopped, and fell down with blue blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more enemies crossing the line of fire. Danny quickly emptied three pre-installed nests. According to the schedule, he raised the guns. The second trench was removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After following the teammates drilling into the entrance of the vertical ditch, a black shadow descended from the sky - I saw a godly warrior leaping high, skipping the front of the trench Barbed wire, waving a big sword to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Running--" He grabbed the malt behind him and slammed it into his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A loud noise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denon felt a light hand and rolled back several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he opened his eyes, there were only half of the people in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The malt looked at him and opened his mouth, but there was a few blood in his mouth, and he couldn’t say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny only felt a scream in his head, yelling at the rifle, and the warrior had already rushed straight up, swiping his arms together Qi Qiu, then swayed to his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, Danny could even see the rough and bloody swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he thought he was about to die, another cold light flashed from the corner of his eye, and he crossed the sword from bottom to top, and shot a series of fires. The power of this attack is so powerful that the weapon of the godly warrior will fly out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman appears on the tunnel, her long black hair is bundled into a ponytail with a waist, and the eyes are shining with golden light. Passover mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior who lost the sword did not retreat, but instead punched her with an empty hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter cleanly cut it to the ground, then walked to the invincible enemy and smashed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue-white mixture splashed Danny's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squinted at the unsettled soldiers and spit out a cold The word, then entangled with two other martial arts warriors who rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This guy is hurt!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry and carry him away!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bringing the malt--" Danny Shame said, wanting to hug the little man in his arms, bare arms can't hold anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is dead!" Someone shouted, "Do you want to kill us all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep up with his teammates to break his hand into his arms, lift him to the back of the trench, and the lifeless malt gradually disappeared into Danny's field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning brings speed to the limit, once again around the insect swarm trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
