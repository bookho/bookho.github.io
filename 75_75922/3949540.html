If it is too slow, the enemy will rush to kill you!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not stare at other places, just look at your fingers!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as teammates Still shooting, your actions don't stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first military camp, Brian is urging the recruits to practice filling, and the nails are among them. One member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a recruit, or even an old member of the First Army. He has been in the militia since the prince’s victory over the evil spirits. The iron head joined the team with strong demands. In the words of the iron head, taking a musket to fight the enemy, defending the prince and Miss Nana, is more than a mine in the mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the nail application, the militia team was reorganized into the first army. In addition to fighting the evil spirits, he defeated the former Roland and the Iron Axe. The great aristocrats who dared not think about it, overthrew the throne of the Duke of Ryan, and even the army of the new king Tiefco failed to step into the border town. After these battles, he has become a small captain of the firearms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, according to the custom of the First Army, whenever a large number of new recruits join, some veterans will be placed in the newly formed team to serve as instructors for the new recruits. Accompanied them to practice and live with them. At first, when the nail was selected, it was not very reluctant. This meant that it was impossible to stand on the front line and fight with the familiar partners for the first time. However, when I was enlisted in the army, I was also the instructor of the old militia team. I had to accept this. task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veteran who was the coach of his team at that time was Brian, and now he has become the commander of the first battalion of the firearms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail hopes that in the future, he will have such a day, can wear the medal awarded by His Royal Highness, and stand in front of nearly a thousand people to give orders. The iron head is really good, this job is much better than operating the steam engine in front of the mine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, what time do we have to practice this training?" A young man muttered in his own line of guards. "There is still snow in the sky." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After practicing your eyes, you can complete this action between the five breaths." The nail stopped in front of him. "You call Haimeng, right." Let's remember to call the report before speaking. This is the rule of the First Army!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Report," the short man beside Haimen shouted, the action in his hand Still not stopping, "Is there eggs to eat this evening?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence made a sound of swallowing in the queue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail can’t help but raise the corner of the mouth, so that the recruits from the northern and southern parts of the kingdom can maintain good discipline even in snowy days. Half a month of uninterrupted training and stick education, as well as enough food to eat - wheat porridge and bacon is a must, occasionally there are small pieces of kippers, or even an egg. However, the latter will only appear in the meal after fighting against the evil beasts or in the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This asks if the evil beast will come to the trouble of the town," he shrugged. "Your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A bitter, adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bullet in your hand has been stuffed for a long time, my next door The grandmother is more flexible than you," nails put up a smile and silenced. "If this is the case before the end of the exercise, don't say eggs, even the meat porridge I have to cancel your share!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd immediately bowed their heads, and it seems that no one is willing to be punished for dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the wall of the watchtower suddenly sounded a rushing bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil beast is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
