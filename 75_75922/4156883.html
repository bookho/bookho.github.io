			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xia is very cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the appearance - of course, her appearance is also very outstanding, the witch seems to be not too bad, even the Poshan who is cold-eyed to him all day long It can't be described as ugly, and sometimes even the other side's face looks like... don't have a touch of flavor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butham will never say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will undoubtedly only double the cold eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xia's cuteness lies in other aspects. When she meets happy things, she laughs. When she meets setbacks, she will cry, never conceal her emotions and thoughts. It is like a clear spring in the snow. But she is particularly persistent in some respects. For example, in the week after getting lost, she is waiting at the platform to wait for him to appear, just to thank him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, everything is fine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s different from all the girls he’s seen before—Xia is the most special one. If other people are black and white, then she must be orange-red It is also like her red curly hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By contrast, Poshan is far worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are clearly witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't think I don't know what you are thinking about," went into the yard and Chalm found that Poshan was waiting for him at the door. "You should Do you know that we are witches?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the first day of understanding." He is in a tit for tat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you admit that you are just playing with your mind?" Poshan raised her brow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know why you have such an idea, but Xia is so cute, I don't have reason to give her to someone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s in the face of Xia, Chamm decides not to say such a thing, but in front of Poshan, he doesn’t want to back down at all, no matter how bold it seems Blurt out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably did not expect him to admit directly, Poshan took a moment, "Can be... cute, that doesn't matter at all! She is a witch, and Witch is impossible - you are not unclear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How about that," Cham raised his chest and showed the "battle hero" worn on his clothes. Badge, "I still have a brother, even if you can't have children, your father won't mind! And this badge issued by your Majesty is enough to protect her future life. Do you have any questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poshan is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, she shouted, "Hey, the guarantee of speech is not counted at all - I will always stare at you and then expose you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Casually." Cham shrugged. "Right, you don't mention that you are a witch. I forgot, what is your ability?" How do you feel that you are just using your own strength to move goods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know why, when he said this, he felt that the other person’s expression was even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that I should not stay here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... I am just curious," Cham swayed, and he realized that it was easy to make people feel ridiculous. Strange... He usually pays attention to the wording, how can it become so casual now? Although the other party is quite unreasonable, he is not a person who must report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he thought that the other party would not answer, Poshan whispered, "My ability is to kill."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham took a breath, "Hey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter picked up a seed from the ground and put it in the palm Soon, the seeds withered at the speed of the naked eye, shrunk, and finally turned into a dark brown cockroach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chalm stepped back two steps. "Why don't you fight the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Witch Alliance did not approve. They are responsible for all witch work arrangements, And my ability must be close contact to display, they think that the danger is too big, it is difficult to have room for development. The final conclusion is to let me choose - in addition to the battlefield." Poshan smiled at some self-deprecating, "So The guarantee of speech is nothing... Roland is no exception."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are nonsense!" Cham can't accept someone who smashes the king in front of him. "Your Majesty has never lost a word. This is something that all winterless people are looking at in their eyes--even if they can't think about it anymore, as long as they agree, they can... achieve..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the other person’s look like a smile, he suddenly had a lack of confidence. “Wait, have you seen your majesty?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen it." Poshan threw down the black shackles in her hands. "The Witch Alliance is arranged to work like this - They will give priority to screening according to their abilities, then ask the witch's personal opinion, and finally combine the two to determine, such as Xia is like this. If the ability is not used, it will be handled by Roland. Personally, according to him, any ability It can play a role in the development of the Grey Fort, and there is no useless person to say it." She paused, "and I belong to the latter one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Cham found himself in a dilemma. He couldn't imagine how to use his purely destructive power in addition to fighting. His Majesty must have been very distressed. But he didn't think it was Roland's mistake, admitting that this was more uncomfortable than his failure to honor his promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello... What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said if you are over fifty In the past 100 years, I can shine in the visual effects and props industry." Poshan grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... what is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows. It seems like with the shadow I am not sure about it. My Majesty said a lot at the time. For example, visual effects are extremely extensive, and old-fashioned is an indispensable part of industrial visual effects..." She moved to the platform with great enthusiasm. Go, "It’s awkward, right? Even if he didn’t lie, it’s been a lot of years, but for now, I’m really just a useless person...”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that this is the case, Cham is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally understood why he had stopped talking before Xia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Witches are hiding in Tibet, Poshan who can fight the chasers must be the core of the group, but now they don’t need them to go to the blood to kill them. Instead, she became nothing, and the gap between the two can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, Chalm was empathetic. When he learned that he was transferred out of the army, he almost felt that he had been abandoned by the world. In such a situation, it is probably normal to have a bad temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the lonely back of his opponent, his heart softened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original he has been calculating, how can he open the other side and send an invitation to Xia alone, but now he can’t say it - if even Xia No, isn’t she alone around her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coughing, Cham reached out and touched his pocket. "That... I have two tickets for a new drama."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter turned back and seemed to be waiting for his following. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have something at night, I don’t think it will be..." He hesitated. "If you want to go with Xia, it’s better than wasting... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bossan’s face was amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before she answered, the sky suddenly sounded like a bang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked up and saw thousands of birds gliding over their heads, almost covering the sun - this cloud-like migratory group of birds, Charme is still seeing for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
