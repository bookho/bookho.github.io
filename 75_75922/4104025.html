			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw the port!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly’s cry suddenly caught the boat The attention of all witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, are you finally here? Half a month..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The silver-white spot is other sailboats?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Isn't that this route only has the beauty of the beauty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fishing boat is a fishing boat."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone smashed into the side of the ship and looked at the direction of Molier’s fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the scene of this scene, the old captain Jack. He smiled and shook his head, and said to a face of dignified Camilla Darry, "Look It doesn't seem to be very happy. It's a rare good day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is it?" The latter replied absently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, go home," Jack shook his pipe. "Is it possible to go back to my homeland for many years. Isn't it worth celebrating? Don't think I can't see it." Come out, you didn't take the sleeping island as your own home - of course, I don't mean that you hate to stay in the fjord, but the shelter and home...there is a difference."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carmela is silent, she does not know what the other party said is not correct, only know that when the letter of His Highness Tilly returns, the number of witches who are willing to go to the west of the Grey Fort has increased a lot. From the initial statistics, 50% gradually climbed to about 80%. If the first batch of witches can be properly placed, she really can't say how many people will be willing to stay in the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should have been their homes there - there is no hostile secular environment, no chilling churches, and living conditions are indeed a lot worse at first. Customs and habits are also very different from those of the land kingdom. As long as you persist in ten years, the island will become better and better. Even without a generation, the newly awakened witch will regard the island as its true homeland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, she whispered, "If it's as you said, it would be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Jack touched his beard. "Don't believe the king?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know?" Camilla looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, you wrote "I don't worry" on your face," the old captain laughed. "Remember the first time you were three years ago." What does it take to take a boat out to sea? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years ago...the big housekeeper indulged for a moment, it was the time when His Highness Tilly’s secretly contacted the witch to evacuate the Grey Fort, as a minority to the identity of the witch The captain of the prejudice, Jack and his beautiful woman risked being accused and tried, and secretly picked up a large number of witches from the port city. Because of this, the sleeping island had a deep friendship with the one-eyed captain. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf? "She hesitated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf? Jack snorted. "Which is so simple." At that time, you were gray-faced, and your eyes were dull, saying that it was no problem to live dead. Look at the present again - do you feel completely different? So the past is the past, now is the present, it is always right to look forward. Several of the witches have also visited the Winter City many times. If it is a bad place, how can they not laugh so easily? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aristocrats are all good-goers-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you also include you? The old captain interrupted her. "If I remember correctly, are you a nobleman?" On the day you leave the Grey Fort, your dress is finer than most shippers - ordinary civilians can't afford silk-woven clothing. Think about it, what happens if I hate the nobility like you? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Camilla opened her mouth but failed to answer it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
