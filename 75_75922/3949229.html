			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woodchuck" Cole looked anxiously at the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this ghost place is not finished with snow, the sky is the same as the sheets that his grandmother has not washed for a few years. The way to judge the hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the training of the militia. As long as the weather permits, they will run through the square in the town center every morning (8 o'clock). The idiots did this before the demon moon, and they are still doing this. Doesn't this group of people know that the most important thing in winter is to save energy? When you really want to escape, you may have to beg the gods to give yourself two legs. However, thanks to the idiots, he was able to determine the approximate departure time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he wants to escape this enchanted town! Although His Royal Highness the order of the second prince was to let him lurk in the town of Bianque, observe the movement of the four princes Roland Wimbledon, and send the information back to Jin Suicheng, but he did not want to stay any longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid that in the next half month, I will become a sacrifice of the devil along with the residents of this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is by no means an alarmist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the winter, the strange things here are endless, others may not be aware of it - it is not surprising that the townspeople are mostly uninformed. The country, in addition to what they eat, they don’t care about anything, even the gods are not in the eye. But he is different, he is "groundhog" Cole! Listening to the news, stealing intelligence is a masterpiece, so His Highness will only find himself to do this kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall that broke through the night, made a strange noise and knocked down the iron rod of the evil beast, of course, these are not comparable to his most amazing discovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four kings of the Tang Kingdom are actually raising witches publicly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is kind, is there anything more exaggerated than this? If the prince is not controlled by the devil, he can't think of other explanations! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the prince wants to take the witch and taste it, it’s OK to be in the castle, and it’s not the first time that Cole heard about the nobles’ private witches. These can be played with care, and the demon girl who is ignored by no one is very suitable for some strange aristocrats, but it is another matter to be public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not his reverie, but what he saw! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of doing the job for whoever gets the money, if the snow is not big every day, Cole will stroll around the city wall, where you can often see four The figure of the prince. Originally, he was strange. What made this incompetent prince have the guts to stay in Bianbu Town, instead of running back to the Long Song Fortress, and now he fully understands that Roland Wimbledon has already been replaced by the devil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw with his own eyes that the wall was broken by a huge evil beast, and the devil killed it with thunder, and then the swarming beast was summoned by a witch. The hell flames were swallowed up, and eventually the witch fell to the prince's arms, and no one had questioned the entire militia team! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued to hear other rumors in the neighbourhood of the neighborhood, saying that there is also a witch who has the healing power. What is the injury of his son? The old lady who is on the opposite side of the road slips and breaks the foot and is cured. It is a swear word! Accepting the treatment of a witch? What is the difference between accepting the corrosion of the devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s two days before Cole made up his mind. He saw a witch flying in the castle of Prince and two turns around the castle. Fly back. The priest of the church often said that the witch was only tempted by the devil to gain a power, and that he saw at least the flames and the flight, plus the rumors of treating the witch, meant that the little town had gathered three witches. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the devil has turned the Lord's Castle into a nest of demon gatherings, and the inhabitants of this place are gradually being controlled by him, and he must flee here as soon as possible. Anyway, holding the secret of quickly building the border wall in his hand, as long as this alchemy powder stolen from the wall is dedicated to the second prince, presumably he will not punish himself, but will reward him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col Yue wants to regret it, why did he not return to the Long Song Fortress with the evacuated aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now wanting to leave this place, the land is definitely not going to work, and the snow that lasts throughout the winter will cover up the road. His only chance was to leave the waterway through the merchant ship in Liuye Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
