			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the big cave of the black light bonfire, the guide leads the hand of the scorpion, and walks lightly to the small hole in the side wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that he is difficult to see even the ground, but the other's footsteps are not slow. And he can feel that the strength of the 76th is not much smaller than himself. There are still a few raised old cockroaches in the palm, which is totally inconsistent with her slender figure. In addition to serving the guests, the underground exhibition also put her When it is used by half of the guards - it is not easy to cultivate such a person, if you can buy one from the "black money". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill. Fox seems to be smart and capable, but after all, he is an old friend, and certainly will not follow him for the rest of his life. Plus, it’s a man. When you start a guard, there’s always something...witted. If it is replaced by the seventy-six, it is obviously more appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this kind of question is just a matter of thinking. After all, the black letter does not belong to him. The four thousand gold dragons have greatly exceeded Otto’s expectations. If you add a private one, I am afraid that the Losey family, one of the three major families, will immediately turn over with him, so that it will not be worth the loss. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering those small holes, Joel found that they were mostly naturally formed passages, and because of the narrow terrain, the light of the torch seemed to be much brighter. Moreover, there are many shafts in the top of the cave, which can faintly see the sky under the curtains. These trails criss-cross and lead to deeper caves, some have been transformed into hotels, while others have signs of barrels, like an underground town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it is necessary to arrange a guide for the customer, otherwise it will take half a day to find your own room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, how can I pay for this auction?" Asked about the people around him, Joel asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After you confirm that the goods are innocent, you can give me the invitation before leaving the ground," answered the answer on the 76th. "I will replace You can complete the next steps. You can also visit our pubs, casinos and hot tubs. Whether you are looking for fun or relaxing, "black money" has the corresponding services. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the money will be recorded in the black letter?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If anyone wants to buy a guide?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is only necessary to pay 500 gold dragons to the "black money"." The answer to the 76th is very smooth and seems to be accustomed to such problems." Adult, do you want to buy me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The relationship is not about the length of time, but the degree of pleasure," Joshua avoided talking. "What do you think?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right. "She couldn't help but laugh out loud.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then, let me see what you look like? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is no good," shook his head on the 76th. "Unless you buy a guide, the latter cannot open the mask privately. This is " The rules of black money. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What services can you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," I touched my red lips, and the words were full of teasing. "It doesn't hinder me from dressing you, adults. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy is more interested.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are here, this is your room "Through a cave, on the 76th, he took him to a wooden door inlaid at the end of the cave. The door was engraved with the same number as her. "The room is divided into two rooms, and I am sleeping tonight. Room, you can call me if you have any instructions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door was opened, Joel couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows. "Is this the outside room?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the narrow and wide front of the cave behind the door. The so-called outer chamber was only one person long and wide. Only a layer of straw was laid on the ground, and it was estimated that it would sleep. It’s no different from the horse.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After all, it’s underground, it’s hard to find so many suitable rooms," the guide didn't care to wave his hand, then opened the second for him.道房门.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔——!唔-!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe walked into the house and saw the witch he photographed at a glance. She opened her hands and feet, and was firmly fastened to the iron ring on the wall. There was a white silk cloth in her mouth. When someone came in, I immediately struggled in panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a twitch in his mouth, and he suddenly smashed the "black money" up and down. He thought that the residence was divided into at least several compartments, and one The prison box dedicated to the imprisonment of slaves is so rude? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you enjoy the long night with the 76th? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performing a live erotic palace in front of the witch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right him, this kind of behavior is probably worse than directly to her. As soon as he thought of Otto and let him gain the trust of the witch as much as possible, Joel’s brow wrinkled deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be other housing in "black money"... I mean the extra money," he asked helplessly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Considering that some guests have higher requirements for the bedroom, we have semi-outdoors that are closer to the ground, as well as adjacent water rooms that are close to the underground. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, it’s horrible for a businessman to earn money.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is the cheapest?" ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three Golden Dragons one night. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This price is almost able to live in the hotel in Wangdu inner city for half a month, about abdomen, but compared to four thousand gold dragons, this amount is fundamental It’s not worth mentioning, it’s a good deal, and Otto Rossi shouldn’t take it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You go out and wait for me for a while,” He considered for a moment, "I have something to talk to this witch, I will call you when I am done." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, grown-up," retired from the room on the 76th.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About He took off his coat and walked over to the witch. The latter struggled more intensely, and his eyes were horrified and fearful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed and would The clothes are covered on the other side. "Listen, I am the one who is supported by people. Come here to save you." No one will hurt you, as long as you don't make noises, everything is easy to say, if you understand, just double your head. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch's struggle stopped, and she lingered for a long time, as if she could not believe what she had heard.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambassador had to repeat it again, the sound slowed down as much as possible - although the other party was very beautiful, but this childish girl was really not his appetite.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time she finally nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyed a sigh of relief and reached out to pull the cloth in the witch’s mouth Come out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you? "She asked after coughing twice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One to save you," Joel went back to the bed and sat down. "Do you have a name?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Amy," she paused. "Since you are here to save me, why not let me go?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What if you escaped?" If it is caught by someone, I can buy you again without another four thousand gold dragons. "About the hand," "For the sake of safety, you'd better keep the appearance of being imprisoned, and it is not easy to cause doubt." When I go out tomorrow, I will let you be free, how? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? Amy is half-hearted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not so easy to believe in others, it’s no wonder that people have found reports, he thought, but this time I met myself, count her Fortune.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only that, I will introduce you to a place where witches gather, there are many companions waiting for you, you don’t have to hide all day. Hidden. "Just got up and stood up," so I will wait until tomorrow, understand? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
