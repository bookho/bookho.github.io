			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the prince’s departure, Lightning pulled the maiden to the corner of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hair is almost towed to the ground, moving like floating Ghost. Pulling out the white hair blocking the cheeks, McMug's cheeks bulged high, and the small mouth was still licking half of the pork chops that had not been swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found an interesting place," Lightning whispered. "It’s in the middle of the forest. I’m going to explore tomorrow. Are you coming with me? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕噜." Mai Hao swallowed the food in his mouth and nodded again and again. "Okay, what are you going to prepare?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exploration three-piece...not right, three of the most common things," Lightning found that when he spoke now, he occasionally came up with a strange vocabulary that Roland used to be His Royal Highness, "Fire, Dry food and daggers. Not far from the distance, it is enough to bring the food for a day. You don't have to fill the entire pocket as you did last time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," McGonagall patted his chest and prepared to leave. Lightning stopped her again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, this adventure is our secret, you don't want to tell other people." The little girl yelled, "We will leave tomorrow morning." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the back of Mai Hao, who couldn’t wait to get past the table, she grinned and began to think about tomorrow’s plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the bombing was successful and did not live up to His Highness’s expectations, she found herself flying far less flexible than before, as if something had bound her. action. As long as the speed is lifted, the lightning seems to have a devil behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the obstacle brought by fear. She realized that the source lies in the journey of the stone tower. After seeing the figure of the deaf in the basement, she lost her calm. And calm, just thinking about fleeing here as soon as possible, then she doubted the identity of her explorer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fear is not terrible, terrible is unknown. To overcome it, you must first approach it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning in the heart of the father's teaching of himself, may face real danger tomorrow, but the explorer should not be afraid of danger, and should not retreat, if you can not overcome this, she will be very It is difficult to fly freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Lightning decided to take advantage of His Royal Highness Roland. According to His Royal Highness plan, the exploration of the stone tower will be arranged after the evil moon, and the first army and the witch team will be dispatched together. She is worried that at that time, even if she visits the stone tower again, it is difficult to produce the idea of ​​"conquering fear" - relying on everyone's courage to dare to approach the danger, can not be called an expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time the Highness may scold her, and punish her ice cream, the sisters of the Witch Alliance will be worried, but she still made up her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the daughter of Thunder, the greatest explorer of the fjord, lightning cannot accept a weak self. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this decision is not equal to recklessness. Compared to a few months ago, she is now unprepared. She now has the revolver pistol given by her Highness. More understanding of the devil, as well as the companionship of Mai Hao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the last point... If you really encounter a group of devils in the tower, you can’t even turn into an enemy like a beast, you can at least bring Run away by yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explorers don’t need a big team to be courageous, she thinks, but can have several trusted teammates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dinner, Lightning wrapped the pieces of honey into a cloth pocket, followed by weapons, torches and water bags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successful completion of the bombing mission has brought her some confidence, and her encouragement and her cheeks have also made her courage multiply. It’s hot to fight the iron, and tomorrow is the best time to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early morning, she flew up to the top of the castle, and Mai was waiting for her at the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
