			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you would plan to be the Lord of the Morning," after Andreia left, the night screamed, "It turned out that it was not Just kidding, do you really want to support her as a queen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't tell," Roland shrugged. "As for me..." His mind There are countless thoughts in the flash, from lack of talent to communication efficiency, from time constraints to limited resources, and finally only one sentence, "after all, it is beyond the reach of the whip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Well..." Nightingale patted him on the shoulder. "But don't worry, Andrea is still very reliable. Quinn's family should not be bad."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to see, these two aristocratic witches really cherish each other, Roland smiled. However, the nightingale has been sent to the fence, and the political vision is worse than the former. This is not related to the family. As long as it is not a fool, there is a chance to go to the sky, and there is no need to pay too much. Most people Know how to choose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he didn’t say it. After all, a mere nonsense night is really cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door knocked again outside the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is open and the door is actually Sabella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also had some surprises. It is reasonable that she is not a member of the Witch Alliance. There is no way to enter and exit the Castle District normally, but after seeing the figure of Ai Gesha outside the door, He probably understands how the other person came to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty," the pure man who belonged to the church, went straight to the ceremony, "I heard Ai Gesha said, Hermes Church." Is it going to collapse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for her serious expression, Roland thought she was coming to the church’s old man to plead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The information is so said, the specific situation is still under investigation." Although he did not fully understand the purpose of the ice witch to disclose these things to the other party, he still The idea to look at it nodded, "There are church evaders in both the Windy Ridge and the West of the Morning. From their confession, the cathedral representing the Holy City faith seems to have collapsed overnight. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that you can send an army to Hermes, and the sooner the better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you remember the hundreds of thousands of mad pellets I mentioned before?" Isabella said, "I don't know how many people know where to store the pills, but it shouldn't be too small... If you leak it, I'm afraid it will have an adverse effect on your plans." She paused. "And these things are also helpful to the battle of God. It is best to collect them all and ship them back to the city without winter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland only remembered at this time, the information provided by the other party did have such a thing, and the cleansing seemed to intend to assemble all the human beings and fight with the devil army. The killer is Massive maddening pills. Because he couldn't pick up these drugs with no potential, he left the matter behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the situation has become less and the same, Isabella is right, if someone spreads the pill, it falls to the Grey Fort nobles or dawn The kingdom, even the black-spotted mouse, will cause a lot of trouble - it may not work against a fully armed army, but the officials used to attack him and the local government are enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where are the pills?" He looked at Isabella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Distributed in the hidden warehouses of the Hermes Plateau, it is difficult to tell where they are," the latter hesitated for a moment, "If you believe In my words, please let me go with the army - I used to be the Pope's agent, this identity should be able to ease the speed of collapse. If the internal disintegration is too fast, it is difficult for the military to control the escape situation." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows if you will use your identity to do something else," the night screamed, "such as secretly letting go of what the believers are... their Have your acquaintance, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
