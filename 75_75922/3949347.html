			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a field trip to the North Slope Mine and two consecutive days of negotiations, Roland reached a new trade contract with Hogg and the Crescent Moon Bay caravan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hog’s eyeballs were falling out when they saw the orbiting ore mining system. He even proposed to invest in the construction of a factory in Bianbu Town, specializing in the construction of mine tracks and supporting equipment, and the profits were half of them, but they were rejected by Roland - the investment can be done when there are many people, the town is now What is missing is people, not money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hog is only a mining businessman after all, although he has several mines, he also manages an open-pit silver mine for the Earl of Kampala in Silver City. Only the miners who got it were much worse than the one that had an island in the Crescent Bay. In the end, the contract he signed was a steam engine that was ordered six months later, and it was also ten sets, as well as a complete mine transportation system (including rails and mine cars). The demon was delivered halfway before the month of the demon, and the rest will be filled in the coming year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Crescent Moon Bay caravan has a lot of tone, and Moore directly signed a ten-year contract. When the caravan comes next time, he will bring a team of 300 people, mainly composed of blacksmiths and carpenters. The remuneration of these people is paid by the Crescent Bay, and Roland only needs to provide accommodation and food. The steam engines they produced in a decade were sold to the Crescent Bay, and ten years later they voluntarily decided to stay – this was what Roland had repeatedly negotiated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that there will be caravans in this group of people. Even after adding this article, the other party will definitely choose to be loyal to the Crescent Moon Bay. The people who decided to stay at that time did not know. But for Roland, skilled workers are always not enough, leaving 10% to earn. What he fears is never a technical advantage, but rather that no one is going to turn his technology into a real product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the steam engine, the second big single comes from the ship transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the three hundred craftsmen, there are two riverboats. The Yueyuewan caravan hopes that Bianbu Town will convert it into a steam-powered paddle steamer. The cost of the renovation was as high as 1,800 gold dragons, and the two combined directly exceeded Margaret's steam engine orders. In contrast, although the mug received three orders, the total amount was less than three hundred gold dragons – this is still the case when Roland raised the price ten times in the convenience store. This made him feel that he could not help but feel the profit gap between industrial products and civilian products. If he could not do mass production, the civilian products would simply satisfy the needs of the town residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince was somewhat surprised that the iron breastplate and iron farm tools were left out. Later, at dinner, Margaret answered his doubts. "Although your breastplate is indeed cheaper, but the output is too small, if you resell, every piece of transportation costs and taxes, perhaps only five or six Jinlong profits. Moreover, is your armor forged by a hydraulic forging hammer? Or it is a steam engine... In any case, the price of this armor is very fixed, expensive on expensive iron, not artificial "She paused. "It’s even more unnecessary to buy it. The sea merchants, whether they are guards or sailors, rarely wear heavy armor, which will make them sink quickly when they fall into the water. Most of the time, armor pairs. They are embarrassed, not protective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same is true for farming tools. If you can't get a lot of cheap iron, it's cheaper and not too cheap. Compared with the local similar products, it is difficult to form any advantage. Unlike the colorful cups, the price is completely fixed, and if you encounter a favorite aristocrat, you may earn several times."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs "It turns out that." Roland thought about it and found out that it was true... For armor and farm implements, which are stable in price, it is difficult to push the price too much when the material costs account for the bulk of the price - he is cheaper and cheaper. The steam forging pressure is more efficient than the water hammer, but unfortunately this difference is not enough to attract the interest of big businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the whiteboard armor with Soroya's stab-resistant coating is also part of the first army dressup, before the iron production is not up, mass sales is impossible It’s gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expected premiere of the drama is coming soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, the townspeople surrounded the central square - this is still the case when Roland dismantled the surrounding old buildings and doubled the square area. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to play a propaganda role, Roland began to issue announcements to inform the people one week in advance, and also ordered the Ministry of Agriculture to send people to the outskirts of the town to mobilize serfs to watch drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
