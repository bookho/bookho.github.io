			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a long, brownish-yellow hair, and the bangs are separated to one side, revealing half a forehead. The five senses look very soft, giving a feeling of warm and touching women in the water. But in this case, the more beautiful it is, the more weird it is – the female ghosts are not all gentle and elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the set of robes on her body is too old, not only rough, cuffs and robes are ruined, it’s like It is a general one from the waste station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I heard your voice going out, want to check if you have closed the door, look back and see a person suddenly behind you." "There is no trace of blood on the face of Jieluo, apparently scared." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman seems to have noticed the movement here. She looked up at the door and looked awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland subconsciously clenched his fists and prepared to face each other's attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect her to be surprised by the next words, “Roland... Your Majesty?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;陛下? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you are..." he tried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am Felice, Your Majesty, what is the situation now?" The confusion and incomprehension in the woman's eyes is not much less than him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis? Roland’s heart was like an electric turn, and a series of doubts emerged one after another. The goddess who guarded the castle in the hall of the castle? Why is she connected to the dream world? Is this world moving from closed to open? Anna, why didn't she appear? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, do you know?" Jielu found something wrong. "What is your armpit... Are you playing role-playing?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, she is...a distant relative of mine," Roland suddenly realized that it was not a time to worry about it. "As for your majesty, it is just a joke. She grew up with me and was not surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Family?" Seeing is not a ghost, the guts of the little girl quickly returned to normal levels. At the same time, it is questioning the rapid growth of the heart. "You just asked who the other person is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there?" He did not change his color, "I only I saw a coward being scared and crying, almost no wet pants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jielu’s cheeks suddenly red, "You, you nonsense!<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that screaming that you sent it?" She was already in the house long ago, but you were doing homework in your bedroom and didn't notice it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, that...I didn't mean to scare you," and the strange woman's comprehension ability also made Roland secretly surprised. "When I left, I left." I happened to go to other rooms, and I wanted to say hello, and you yelled and ran out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess the fact is probably the same, she asked what the situation is, it was actually scared by you -" Roland added the last knife, "if one When I went out, I saw a little ghost screaming, but I was also confused. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I..." Jielu’s words were screaming. The scream was a fact, she couldn’t deny it, and she didn’t have the habit of lying, and suddenly fell into a dilemma. In the situation, tears gradually formed in the eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔...It seems to be too much, he bent over and touched the little girl’s head, "In short, This is a misunderstanding. Go back and learn. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this adult's temperament, you can't win, Roland feels without guilt, just as it grows up. Baptism, the life that has not been deceived by the adults is incomplete.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that Jielu would sobb and ran into the bedroom, but did not expect the other to suck He snorted and shook his tears back, then lifted a kick and kicked it on his lap. "Uncle, you bastard! "This is an angry return to the room.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," the woman who claimed to be Felice couldn't help but laugh. "It seems that here you are not the supreme mortal king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But here, I am the master of the world," Roland made a gesture of asking. "Go to my room and talk, I have a lot of questions to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, he finally made sure that the other person was Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not just what happened in Takira, but what you saw and heard in the castle, and the experience of being a "black money" maid on the 76th. She said that she was the leader. Even some things that he didn't know very well, she was very detailed and able to echo back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least on this point, it is possible to rule out that she is the conscious body of the birth of the world itself - it is impossible to do this by reading his memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the body that Felice now has is the body that she accepts when she extracts the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would she enter the world of dreams? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know too well..." Felice shook her head. "It was already late. The first army had just changed the shift. I plan to cut the body." Control, use deep sleep to quickly restore energy, I did not expect to be here in a blink of an eye." She paused, "You call this place ... dream world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, a world that only works when I dream, but I don't know if this rule is still valid." There is no need to hide this step. The most urgent task is to find out why the other person is connected to the dream. - Although he has long understood that this complex world does not exist in his mind, but suddenly the feeling of seeing outsiders is quite... horrified, after all, one can confirm that the dream world is based on his memory. Constructed, this is equivalent to someone who has entered his memory without authorization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland unfolds the ladder behind the door and places it at the bedside. "Perhaps we can test it to find out why you came to the world of dreams." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?" Felice said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I fall from the top of it, the dream will end. You can try it first to see if you can go back to the real world. Then I interrupt the dream again. If you can get out of the way, you will wait for me in the lobby, I will come down immediately," Roland explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait... Your Majesty," Felice suddenly reached out and grabbed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move surprised him. If there is no winter city, this is undoubtedly a rude move. She can't forget the customs of the past few hundred years because she suddenly came to an unfamiliar environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you... force me to slap it?" she whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Roland groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please use the best strength, okay?" Felice tied her sleeves and handed the white arms to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pain is not going to wake up, I have already confirmed this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I just want to feel it... please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling? Reminiscent of Aegusa's description of the godly witch, Roland suddenly understood her thoughts. After a moment of silence, he extended his right hand and squeezed it hard on the other's wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis clenched his teeth and made a cry from the eyes of the blind man, such as a thirsty traveler who suddenly drank a sweet dew The cockroaches trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, she opened her eyes and gave her a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The god is on, I can feel the pain again!" Felice changed like a man at this moment, watching Roland's eyes almost emit light. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
