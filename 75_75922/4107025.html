			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not," Roland’s relatives pointed out her forehead. "And the idea is also like your style."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you happy for the words of Isis?" Anna did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not pleased with the picture she speculates - because history itself is full of possibilities," Roland laughed. "You can see clearly." It’s hard to get in the past, not to mention predicting the future. For example, it’s possible that the third battle of the gods will pass smoothly, but the fourth battle of the gods after hundreds of years has completely collapsed, or the enemy hidden in the sea is far superior. Imagine that people on land can only be divided and eliminated. At that time, let alone the kingdom is immortal, and even the continuation of humanity is a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔... ...this guess is really like your style." Anna said in his tone, "Where are you happy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Her perspective," Roland spread his hand. "When the words were spoken, Isis had changed from a noble official to a national official."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Country... Official?” Anna repeated this somewhat swearing word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the position she is standing on is no longer in the north, but the gray castle as a whole, by speculating the overall direction of the kingdom Thinking about policies is a very rare thing for people of this era - you know that even Barov has not done it. In the mind of the city hall manager, he has always been from the perspective of no winter city. To measure the gains and losses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a leap-forward change. From the beginning, Isis Kant was still a member of the Northern Territory. Her words and deeds and suggestions are helping the North, while also benefiting from the North. This is the most common consciousness of the aristocrats in the land. Only the site where the family is waiting is the only place for the individual. Even if they are loyal to the king, the interests of the territory are above the command of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other point is her view of the witch." Roland went on to say, "I can understand that witches can bring technological leap and their ability." Pulling to the development strategy, from this point of view she is ahead of most people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, and know why It is a very different matter. Although he has proposed in the textbook that "technology is the primary productive force and witch is the best catalyst for technology", most city officials do not understand the meaning of preferential treatment of witches. They only do this. Because of the command of His Majesty the King. The people also don’t understand that they and the witches get along well because some witches bring convenience to their lives, and that’s it. This coexistence relationship is as fragile as a layer of bubbles. When confronted with major conflicts or setbacks, the situation on both sides is extremely prone to retrogression. Only when the indispensable concept of the witch is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people can this problem be solved fundamentally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that Roland is more satisfied than the former. After all, with the acceleration of centralization and the disappearance of the land-sealing differences, more and more officials will accept a country. The idea of ​​a rule of governance, but to make them understand the nature of the witch's ability, I am afraid it will take a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Itis is not without shortcomings. Although her vision has surpassed most people, she still has not surpassed the times. It is a never-ending kingdom of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, considering that her age and nightingale are quite the same, it is not surprising to have such a thought. Roland is very much looking forward to what kind of consul will she become under her guidance after twenty or thirty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the general explanation, Anna swears, "Since the future is unpredictable, you will not consider the gray castle after the death, if we can live the battle of divine "What do you want to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You already know, aren't you?" Roland stared at her rippling eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar topics have been mentioned more than once in the night when the two have been sleeping together - across the fertile plains, to the light, even the devil's territory Cross the sea line and let the human footprints spread over the other side of the sea; uncover the veil of the gods and gain insight into the truth of the world. To this end, he will use all available resources, not only the gray castle kingdom, but everyone who lives on this continent will contribute to this exploration. Any stubborn who tries to block will be his enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
