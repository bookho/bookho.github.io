			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Rock!" Someone seems to want to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter." Meteor swayed. "If I remember correctly, more than 30% of these cores are seized by the hunter. If he wants to." The core idea is not to wait until now. To be honest, Roland is not a creative person, I can hardly tell, but in the fight against the demon, he is definitely the most competent one." After he finished, he nodded to the secretary. "Go and take the core box."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a secret at the top, and many people have heard of the outstanding performance of new hunters. The old factions even raised their anger for this, and for a while they talked a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, eradicating the demon and getting back to the core is a task that requires multi-party collaboration, because the enemy usually only picks up those martial artists who are not strong, usually Hidden in the darkness of unknown, there are very few opportunities left for the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the emergence of new hunters, the demon slayers are like moths of fire, one after another falling in his hands, this hunting efficiency It has also been ranked in the history of the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the brief silence in the hall, another middle-aged man opened his hands and said, "God can be put aside before the proof, I think Ask Mr. Roland another question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shrugged indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Finanese Miss Han’s serious injury, I also asked the emergency doctor to understand that it is not the force of nature and the trauma that modern medicine can recover. They said You used some medical devices that seemed to be unremarkable or even inconsistent with quality standards, but they produced incredible effects, just like... it seems to regenerate flesh and blood." The man took a deep breath, "Maybe you are out of a certain Some considerations, it is inconvenient to disclose the origins and manufacturing methods of these appliances, I don't want to ask more, just - can you sell some of these medical supplies to the association? I guarantee the price is good!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also the question I want to ask," Fiji suddenly turned his head and asked him in his ear. "Can save me like that, don't tell me what you use." In fact, it is another world-class fairy grass or elixir. Medical equipment is nothing but a scorpion. Although I have a little savings, I am still far from being rich."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Rolandton can’t help but he didn’t expect to be in other The genius martial artist who is quite inaccessible in the mouth will also say something like this, "Do not worry, free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call...that's good. "Finan is cold and sigh of relief," but don't say anything to them. Sometimes the more free, the less they know how to cherish."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is better A clear gesture, then looking at the middle-aged man, "Of course. The martial arts home is the front line against erosion. I naturally hope that everyone can put down the painful concerns and fight the enemy to the end. In addition, I have no intention of concealing their origins. Those things are not products of this world, but come from another world. They have all been modified by magic, and in a sense, they are not belonging to everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a big news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference hall suddenly exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another...world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is magic?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, he just mentioned the need to release the magic of being imprisoned - is it the power of nature that is also a kind of magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will know." In the face of the inquiries of everyone, Roland calmly replied, "Including where I was before the birth of the world, what is the intention of the gods, and the magic and The relationship of the world... I will tell you all about this. But before that, let everyone see the most direct evidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell The guardian secretary walked into the conference hall with a safe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the check of the fingerprint and the iris, the box automatically opens, revealing a row of neatly placed glass jars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
