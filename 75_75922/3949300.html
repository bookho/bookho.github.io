			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Roland sat in the office and began to conceive new equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pills that appeared in the clear water port gave him a strong sense of crisis. No matter why the church should support him and Garcia to compete for the throne, just think of the number in the hands of Garcia. The strength of thousands of horses, he felt the scalp numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the speed of thousands of steel warriors on foot and running out of the cavalry, rushing to him with an unstoppable momentum, the thin line of guns is only difficult to block. As long as one person rushes into the ranks, it will cause heavy losses to the First Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this kind of pill does not provide the effect of immune damage, and the person taking the drug is still flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must have a weapon with higher rate of fire and precision, and can fire continuously at a greater distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without mercury sulphur as a primer, Roland must find a way to get around this hurdle by first producing a batch of alternative equipment to cope with a possible crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Anna’s new ability gave him great confidence, and now that he can draw the design, Anna can be precisely processed and the efficiency is amazing – - She can now stack several pieces together and cut them at the same time as the rifle parts that were previously forged by a blacksmith hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Educational education and unified weights and measures are prepared for industrialized production, but it does not mean that there are shortcuts. Anna's new ability is a treasure trove with endless potential for excavation. Roland now goes to the North Hill Mountain every afternoon to study the use of black fire with her. If it is really empty, she will let her practice control and engrave some small things - such as the witch's hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although her current skill in carving people is still very young, Roland believes that one day his bookcase exhibition will be filled with witches of all kinds. Hand model... probably? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked out a steel ruler and pressed it on the parchment, only two strokes were made, and a knock on the door sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the guards did not report, then the ten ** came to the witch. At this moment, most witches learn to read characters and four arithmetics in the living room and the book on the first floor. Therefore, if you don't have to participate in basic teaching, you have time to come to find his witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Anna is pushing the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gently closed the door and walked to the Roland table, holding a book with gold rims in her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be able to borrow a book that can only be made once a day before the class, and I have to say that although Anna is not very fond of talking, the relationship is in the witch group. It is unexpectedly good. Thinking of Nanawa, who had been attached to her behind her little tail, maybe she was born with the charm of attracting witches? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Have a difficult question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm," she Nodded and spread the book in front of Roland. "Here... you said that everything in the world is made up of small balls. These balls are different, but you mentioned later, can they be turned into... waves?" Anna asked Tao, "What is the wave?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You throw the stone into the water, the shock is the wave," the prince coughed twice. "This is a concept." If you look at it, you don't have to go deeper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of myself I don't understand, Roland is crying and laughing. The microscopic quantum field is a mysterious and mysterious thing. I knew I wouldn't write this content. I think so in my heart, but I can't say it on my mouth. "Because the ball has the characteristics of waves, it also has the characteristics of matter. We are also made up of small balls, but we are too massy and it is difficult to observe the volatility. As for the reason for a deeper level, it will take countless generations to explore.” He thought and added, “Because this phenomenon and common sense are quite conflicting, it is very difficult to understand, just like being in the body. In the three-dimensional world, we can hardly imagine that the four-dimensional space is the same. You don't have to worry about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna pouting, seems not very satisfied with Roland's explanation, but she soon Also asked, "What is the four-dimensional space?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she stopped asking, the prince was already dry. He really underestimated Anna's quest for knowledge, and if he continued this way, he would have nothing to teach her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when Roland asked the other person about the progress of mathematics, she replied easily: "That is much simpler, now I am seeing equations and matrices." It’s quite interesting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s much simpler, it’s very interesting...Roland suddenly thinks the gap between people is too big, how long what? In a week, I learned the matrix equation from a simple elementary function, and then I went to calculus. Putting it in school, Anna is definitely a daunting schoolmaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And... still a very beautiful schoolmaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at the woman who looked down at the book and was a little bit fascinated. Her thin bangs lie in front of her forehead, and there are sporadic hair tips on the cheeks. He can't help but stretch out his index finger, pull up his hair and gently lie behind her ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and looked at Roland with a smile in her eyes. The blue pupil of the lake is no longer as calm as water, but ripples. So close at each other, until Anna Zhang said a word - no sound, only the mouth shape. Roland still interpreted her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The nightingale is not here now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of this sentence is straightforward, but Roland It’s stupid to think that if you don’t understand it. The room was silent, and he could almost hear the other's breathing and heartbeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he approached, Anna closed her eyes and a blush on her cheeks. Roland smelled the scent of her body and gently kissed her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of softness came through the touch, and the time seemed to solidify at this moment, I don’t know how long it took to separate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for him to say something, Anna slammed her feet and let the two lips together again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咦-ha-嘿!" Mystery Months In bed, close your eyes and meditate, hold your hands up, and have words in your mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What crazy are you doing?" Lily asked the towel on her wet hair and frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am thinking of myself as a particle composition," she blinked. "I am a particle," and then stretched my finger to Lily. "You are also a particle!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem." The latter rolled his eyes and drilled into a soft bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, no." Mystery Month sighed. "I obviously think of everything around me as a particle. Why not like Anna?" What is the evolution of new capabilities?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you don't believe it at all." Lily said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't believe," she shook her head, "the only person What I can't deceive is myself... Although I don't know why, Anna probably unconditionally believes what she said to the prince from the beginning. Of course, she is smarter than you, which is the key reason why she can acquire new abilities. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, don't think about it, sleep with peace of mind." Lily, the handkerchief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you not want to have this ability?" Mystery month smirked, "I want to do more for the prince."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Evolved to make food preservation last longer?" She yawned, "not interested. Besides, why do more things for him, men are ruthless and fickle People, echo is an example placed in front of your eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking of no interest, when class is so clear, so concentrated." Mystery month whispered, "Besides the leaves, it is your most serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
