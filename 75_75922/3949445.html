			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The environment of the sleeping island is getting better every day. As long as it flies, Tilly can see the crowds and the lively market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is no longer the place where the original three hundred witches were isolated and reclusive. Through negotiation and negotiation, the Crescent Bay, Shuanglong Island in the fjord islands, Both the Sunset Port and the Shallow Water City have established commercial links with the Sleeping Island. She has also introduced a group of ordinary residents from some crowded villages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they are currently living on the outskirts of the island and are far from the witches, Tilly believes that one day, the island will become a city without each other. . Convergence is a slow but promising process. Whether the witches awakened on other islands join the island, or they remain in the place of birth and are accepted by the local people, it is good news for the sleeping island. This means that Tilly and the migrated witches will get more supporters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go down, wind up," Ashes shouted underneath, "Crash!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I am so good!" She waved her hand, and suddenly the body sank down. After falling a certain distance, it stabilized the figure. "Oh... there is still something that is not easy to control."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know that bad control is still so high!" Gray footpath, "You can practice in a lower place, or go to the sea. If you don't come down, I have to climb." The roof is going to catch you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, well, I know," Tilly feels the wind is getting bigger and bigger, no longer reluctant, gather The magic of releasing it slowly landed in the courtyard of the residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you ask for this kind of thing next time, call Morrie first." Ashes rounded his eyes. "At least her magical servant can catch it." You."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as I keep the magic supply, I can't fall down, at best I can't control the direction," she took off the blue magic stone glove in her hand. Give it to the other party. "You can also try it. It feels great to fly. From the air, overlooking the island, you will feel that the whole world has become completely new."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I still can't," Ashes waved his hand. "The lightning stone at the beginning can't be fired, let alone the stone that needs to continue to inject magic. And it has only one, even if you master the control skills, there is no The method is to fly with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also," Tilly retracted the glove with some regrets. "I often think that if you can understand the principle, you can How good is the magic stone that makes the corresponding ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think it "Made?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," she nodded without hesitation. "No matter how polished or used, these stones are unlikely to be Naturally formed. The group who built the relics must have a deeper understanding of the magic, but unfortunately they did not leave more clues than a bunch of incomprehensible documents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a huge white figure fell in the sky, because the speed of falling too fast, almost slammed on the ground, stirring up a circle of dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mc茜?" The ashes picked up their eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... it’s a painful death," came the little girl, she climbed up from the ground and squinted her head. "I was not blind now." Did Tiley fly in the sky! If it is not the wrong color of the hair, I thought it was lightning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not mistaken, I just did fly Going up," Tilly smiled and rubbed her cheek. "How? Is the witch on the island sleeping in the town of Bianbu?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's very good, they all ask me to send you a letter," Mai said from the bag and found the letter. "This is lotus, this is Evelyn's, and this... is the prince's." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly’s slight glimpse, I saw that the letter of His Royal Highness was half-thick and thick, and it was wrapped around the outside, which was more like a parcel. It’s a little bit heavy in the hand, obviously it’s not just a simple stationery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Working hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
