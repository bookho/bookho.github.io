			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I want to ask you when I enter the door," Hogg reveals a look that has finally slowed down, a pot of ice water in a wooden bucket. He was drunk, "The painting in the hall... I am afraid that it is not something that ordinary people can draw? Whether it is the degree of realism or the perspective of the earth from the air." He paused and lowered his voice. "This Is it... the work of the witch?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at Margaret, who nodded. “Please rest assured, Your Highness, Hogg is the old man I have known for many years. Friends, he is also not malicious to the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guessed it is true, it was indeed drawn by the witch." Roland took a hot air balloon near the beach two days ago. After sightseeing, I wanted to preserve this magnificent scenery. In addition, the castle’s living room was decorated in a simple style, and there was no hanging painting. He simply let Soroya turn the stone wall behind the main seat into a huge mural. . With the artistic background wall, the lobby style has been improved several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will know," Hogg sighed. "Although they are promoted as the devil's minions, those singular abilities are enviable. Ordinary people I can't fly into the air like them, and then draw a mural that is so beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You only said the first half," Roland shook his head. Tao, "Ordinary people can fly even if they don't rely on magic power. They even fly higher than the eagle and fly faster than the Swift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You are really humorous," Hogg laughed. "Unless we have a pair of wings, we have to be lighter than birds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Greg is stunned, "Really?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," the prince smiled. "I can prove it to you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the merchants see their own inventions, which is also an effective way to enhance relationships and expand trade channels - from mugs to liquor, as for selling Have to go out is another matter. Anyway, the caravan will stay in the town for a few days. The regular business negotiation process should be the final signing of eating, drinking and playing. And Anna is also very interested in taking a hot air balloon trip, just to let her take a lot of rest from the busy work, it is a multi-tasking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lookout quickly completed the inflating. This time, Roland simply called the witch who couldn’t get to the hot air balloon last time. Lucia asked me again. Did take the younger sister to go and have a look, he also promised to come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the balloon carried the crowd slowly, Margaret clenched his mouth in surprise, and Hogg clung to the edge of the basket, I don’t know. Excitement is still afraid. The bell was too short, and she couldn't see the scenery outside the hanging basket. Lucia had to pick her up, ride on her shoulder, carefully approach the basket, and don't tamper with her. The lightning as a navigator and rescuer has been hovering around the hot air balloon, and from time to time, the bells are showing their faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the hot air balloon once again swayed along the southern coastline and completed an aerial sightseeing tour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After returning to the castle, Hogg’s legs are still shaking, he knots Baba said, "I never thought that looking down in the sky is so terrible. I feel like I will fall down at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "It’s just a few times," Roland said with a smile. "The first time someone who left the ground with both feet will have the illusion that it will be like a person who has never been to the sea, and will spit on the bumpy sea boat."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said a little better," Margaret said with amazement. "The scenery I saw today is incredible. Looking at the edge of the sea from the air, it looks like a blue arc. Line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But your Highness, I don't seem to be wrong," Hogg drank the iced white wine. "Ordinary people did fly to the sky, but this It is still the merit of the witch. Without them, this big guy should not be able to fly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, my old friend "Roland hasn't said anything yet, Margaret said first. "Don't you find out? Miss Anna is just releasing the flames. I also specifically asked about lightning. She told me to just put in the air into the airbag. I can ascend to the sky myself. The flame is not the privilege of the witch. Your Highness, is that right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
