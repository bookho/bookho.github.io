			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilvey is the first to see such an incredible move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice crystals condense in front of her, as if she had paved a mirror-like road, not only that, the road seemed to carry her forward, and in a flash, she Already close to the back of the first beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw Aegusa sticking out his hands, the surrounding green space suddenly appeared hoarfrost, and even the snow floated in the air! The beasts screamed, flapping their wings and trying to fly, but found that they could not move - its thick limbs had been frozen on the ground, and the ice crystals climbed up the legs and legs, quickly wrapping the torso and the shredded wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, Mai Hao rushed forward, opened his blood bowl and bite on the other neck of the beast that is still dancing. The latter panicked to break free, but the difference between the two is too big, just like the young beast that has not yet been out of the nest is suppressed by the adult beast. When McMurray swayed his head, he completely twisted the other's neck, and the beast was smashed, leaving only the tail still swaying, and the hapless egg that was frozen into ice was crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third time only reacted, although it does not quite understand why "the same kind" will suddenly kill each other, but also know that the situation is not good. Spreading a few meters long flesh, it vacated directly -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is already late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha followed closely and flew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, she walked in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice crystal follows the fear of the beast and stretches out, and in a blink of an eye, it builds a bridge that goes straight into the air - Ai Gesha runs along the ice bridge. The goal was quickly included in the magic range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi couldn’t help but cover his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice bridge is like a flexible snake, biting the tail of a beast, and then turning it into an ice sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the end of the ice bridge that can not withstand such a heavy object, the 断裂 啪 断裂 断裂 , , , , 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 断裂 , , , , , , , The ice sculptures were heavily squatted on the ground, and they were suddenly torn apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Aisha out of the woods to the three evil beasts are all solved, and there is no time before and after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way the high-level witch fights! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi couldn’t help but admire Ai Gesha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咔嚓."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale checked the bullets and closed the nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, she heard the warning from the leaves: the enemy has changed, and the melting point action has been changed to option two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that Effie’s mission has been cancelled and she must be shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the most important thing is to create an opportunity for Anna to release her mindfulness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought of Anna, the nightmare will involuntarily emerge from Roland’s entrustment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, you have to bring her back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All is please You are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She grabbed her chest and bit her lip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action should have been done easily, but she found that there was a hint of unspeakable emotion in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task is now getting tricky and the mood is gradually expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If things are really bad to that step, does it mean that Anna is also possible...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;In a sense, Anna is the savior of all the helpers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is an omission for this reason, she will not forgive herself for the rest of her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy is coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the leaves rang in her ear, the nightingale Spirit, wrapped in the direction of the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of fog is often deserted and monotonous. Things that have nothing to do with magic are twisted lines and unchanging black and white blocks here. Nightingale is still the first time. To such a rich and mottled color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green forest background is not to say, the two mad devils have a dim yellow luster on their arms, and the body shows a pale blue; the other two It should be the heart fear in the leaf warning, their magical reaction is much stronger, and the body seems to have multiple magical vortices, the most conspicuous in the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a high-level devil that needs to be focused on the defense. It is not in the team. If the intelligence is correct, it should be monitoring the situation over the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the fear that can cause panic should be the first to be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Before they open their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all four devils pass through their lurking position, the nightingales are armed with two guns, jumping forward one step at a time, the distance of more than ten meters is instantaneous, and the muzzle directly arrives. Behind the head of a fear! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a close distance, she doesn't even need to get out of the fog, as long as it is not too bad luck, the barrel will not be cut into two segments by the rash lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunpowder gas is ejected and makes a huge roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the black and white world, the target’s head suddenly expands, like a bullet carrying an unstoppable force into its skull, directly The whole head was smashed into five or six petals, black and white bolognese and debris were shot forward, followed by a fog rising into the sky - the nightingale noticed that its red mist pipe was buried directly in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other heart fear is so fierce that the blood scars on his face are blooming all around, and the eyes are showing their true eyes, but the tree tops suddenly hang down. A few vines, entangled in its head, pulled it back. At this time, the two madmen just heard the guns turned around, and the result was opposite to the fear of the four eyes, and suddenly stagnated in place, the body kept shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nights did not hesitate to reward the remaining three bullets to the fear that was forcibly turned by the leaves, and Anna also jumped out of the trunk The sorcerer has not yet recovered from the panic, and cut them into pieces with black fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning that has been tempting the enemy in the air suddenly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale just raised his head, only to find a giant sword is coming to himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously want to break into the fog, but find that the enemy wielding the hilt reaches out to oneself - the black and white world that has emerged is instantly crushed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this ability! Can it interrupt the magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale is completely out of time to avoid it, and the blade will fall, and a black curtain suddenly spreads over the top of his head--it is more like a curtain than a curtain. Very smooth mirror, she can even see the look of his own surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...black fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哐!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Sword is on the black fire, Anna face The painful color appeared, and the body was crumbling, but the black fire never disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This nightingale is no longer hesitant, she hugged Anna, re-summoned the fog, and sighed more than 20 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
