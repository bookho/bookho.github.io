			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... It’s so delicious!" After a long time, Felic’s swallowing action slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever other diners pass by, they will cast a surprised look - the table is full of all kinds of lunch boxes, from burgers to egg tarts It is enough for five or six people to enjoy, but only three people are sitting at the table. To this end, Roland also received a lot of disdainful eyes, the possibility of these foods being stuffed into his stomach is obviously much higher than the two slender women on the opposite side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Scratch her," Roland said helplessly, and at the same time, she was a little lucky, but she was brought to a fast food restaurant instead of a high-end restaurant. Otherwise, this Can easily eat his wallet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo took out a wet wipe to help Felice wipe the tears and the oil on her lips - fortunately, the witch is born with beauty, almost no makeup Otherwise, this tearful lunch had already smeared her face. The little girl is probably the first time to see that there are still people who have been so miserable. Even eating Kaifeng will be happy to tears, sympathy has already flooded, and her attitude towards her has changed 180 degrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are sweet cones here, but we can talk about dreams first," seeing her eating almost, Roland drank a cola, into the subject, "Are you discovering something vision or something wrong before you dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." She glanced at the cleansing lady beside her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, it's just a childhood dream," he blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand," Felice immediately understood what he meant. "It’s been a long time since it happened... Let me think about it, there was nothing at the time." In particular, I just cut off consciousness by the wall as usual, which helps me to quickly restore my spirit without completely losing my vigilance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the consciousness can also sense the changes of the outside world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded, "just stopped the control of the body, the consciousness sank into the darkness, but it appeared around When I am in danger, I can still see it. It is not uploaded from the visual or auditory, but a feeling that can't be said, just like someone reminds me in the middle of it. Celine called this phenomenon a potential connection. If you are drawn into the soul container, it is a complete sleep, there will be no perception."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" Tao, "Who is Celine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A psychiatrist, an adult talking Don't interrupt the words," Roland glanced at her. "If you feel bored, go to the park and watch other people fly and fly kites. Don't be too far away from us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl snorted with dissatisfaction and grabbed the cone and walked out of the store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you?" Felice asked through the floor-to-ceiling window and looked at her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, the level of law and order in this era is very high, and most people can't lie to her," Roland shrugged. "You go on."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, once in deep sleep, I should be floating in the darkness of the margins. There is no light, no sound, nothing exists... and nothing can be done." The ancient witch was paused. "But the scene that emerged this time has become your home in the dream world. At that time, my surprise was hard to describe in words. Fortunately, I saw you soon."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔..." Roland thought for a moment. "In other words, the only difference between this sleep and the usual is that you are in my castle."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is only this difference." Felice swallowed the last cone and gave her a satisfying tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the yellow tip of the tube disappeared a little in the mouth of the ancient witch, Roland suddenly flashed a thought in his head, "The light column!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not saying that when I fall asleep, there will be huge, as broad as the walls Is the orange-yellow beam?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
