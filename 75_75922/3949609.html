			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, the West Wharf area seems to be a bit wrong," the guard who was in charge of blocking the street suddenly walked to the Count of Meade. "I heard there. The strange sounds sounded, and two teams were sent to investigate the situation, but they did not come back alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Jacques Meade frowned. "You won't be wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I heard it very clearly, like a person who constantly inhales and screams, snoring Snoring like this..." The guard also simulated two times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would the tramp be snoring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The weather is sleeping outside Frozen to death, adults," the pro-guard insisted. "And if a person can make such a loud snoring, it must be at least a giant line of people close to the city wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The count stared at him for a long time before turning his head and shouting, "Sirkan Dao!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, you call me?" A nobleman with a maple leaf emblem on his chest came over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take your guard, go down with my hand and check the dock inside the city," Jacques patted him on the shoulder. "What news, immediately I report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... can you find someone else?" The young nobleman hesitated. "My father told me I must enter the castle with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long does it take to go to the dock to see a lap? There is still a drain on it," the count laughed. "Even if the honeysuckle rebelliously surrenders, I will wait for you here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the two leaving, Jacques His face is cold, what is the meaning, thinking that sending a son to join the castle with me is equivalent to having the same credit? This abacus is also playing very well, and I can only mention me alone in my secret letter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, he vaguely heard the sound of gunshots in the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? When Jacques was wary, the parents of Maple Leaf did not even have a musket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he was planning to adjust his knight to check the situation, the previously reported guards stumbled into the camp. "Big, adults... not good. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rebel...rebel He said with wide eyes. "There are thousands of people who are coming to the castle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean Roland Wimbledon The team?” Jacques raised his hand and gave the guard a slap. “How many thousands of people? In the camp, nonsense, do you believe that I will hang you up to the gate now?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults, they are indeed holding the flag of the gray castle royal family," the guards did not dare to dodge, so they had to kneel down. "I want to let Sir Daokan’s embarrassment to catch two Individuals ask questions, and as a result, they just rushed over, just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" asked the count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was knocked down by a dense array of guns," the guardian’s expression seemed to see something terrible. "At the time, there were countless sparks in the dark. The sound of 噼 啪 几乎 has almost never stopped! More than 20 talents just rushed out less than a hundred steps, all fell to the ground, even the horse did not stand!” He swallowed, I have never seen such intensive shooting. If there are not more than a thousand people, how can they get rid of the Jazz Guard in an instant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maple Leaf's What about the eldest son?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Already...running.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl’s feet are soft How is it possible to sit in a chair? In his head, he was in a mess, counting the time when the news came and went. At the noon yesterday, the four big families started to move. The four princes will be able to rush to the long song fortress this evening. Doesn’t he mean that he can travel to and from the two places in one day? This speed is impossible even if it is a sailing boat. And thousands of people are more like the Arabian Nights, can transport so many people in one breath, at least need a huge fleet, and intelligence from Bianbu Town shows that they did not even have a ship before winter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
