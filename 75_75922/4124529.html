			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Honey was very happy when he was called into the office. When he entered the door, he looked around the mahogany table and seemed to want to see it transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Roland couldn't help but be curious. "Is there any difference in this table?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you put the baby inside?" The honey even smelled on the table. "Or does it have other functions, such as heating up at night?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could it be..." He laughed dumbly. "This is just an ordinary desk. It is also a document and an official letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, is it?" Honey looked suspiciously. "So why do night sisters stay at the table every night for a long time?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What, what?" Roland and Wendy suddenly glimpsed, while the nightingale bounced off the lounge chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I train gray hair, it tells me, although it can only be expressed by action." Honey is back in a serious way, "Night sister always Sitting in your position when no one is sitting, with your face on the table - å”” -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not finished yet, the nightingale has flashed in one step, tight Tightly grabbed her mouth. "I, I am just a little sleepy, leaning on the table for a while! Then again, how can birds and birds know what I am doing? You are wrong at all!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty helplessly supported his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," Roland coughed twice. "Probably the gray hair is wrong? After all, the black light is on fire at night..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honey is vague in the palm of the nightingale, "The gray hair is an owl."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a short time in the office Silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, you should be mistaken," Roland cleared his throat and waved his hand to the red-faced nightingale. The latter smashed his feet and broke into the fog directly, completely hiding his body shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that she will not show up for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? I understand." Honey did not ask. "If the table can be hot, I originally wanted one." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Roland raised his eyebrows. "Is there no heating in the castle and the witch building?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is no in the garden. If the leaves are not there, it will be difficult to warm up. They are not willing to move recently. I am afraid that they are cold, and they have set up a platform under the olive tree. Hold them to sleep together. If the table can be warm, they will be more comfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So will she be so interested in her desk? Roland noticed that the fluffy curls of the honey were still stained with a few bird feathers, which looked like an untreated grass nest. He found that he did ignore the living environment of the animal messengers, and subconsciously believed that they themselves had the ability to adapt to nature, but did not consider the evil moon to let them take the action of wind and snow has violated the laws of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the table can't heat up, I will make people have a fire in the garden," he said with a smile. "There is almost a bed." Big, can you bring all the animals you train together, how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Honey eyes lit up, "Thank you!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is nothing, can you really talk to them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honey Sorry to scratch my head, "In fact, as the night sister said, most animals can't talk, so only use simple actions to imitate what they see. It's common to guess wrong. It doesn't count. Real conversation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that Roland thought that although the magic could make the tamed birds and beasts obey the honey, they could not give them almost human Intelligence, which turns it into another species, "If you just let them find something interesting, then show you the direction?"<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
