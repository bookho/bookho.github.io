			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the high-altitude machine gun is only to solve the problem, the most effective means to deal with the enemy in the air is always another air weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the era of the federation, this responsibility is usually carried out by witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few capable singers of the sky plus a few more extraordinary witches wearing flying magic stones are the most elite combat forces of the Federation. Although this unit belongs to the Holy Blessing Army, it has a higher status than other fighting witches. According to Pasha, the three seats of the Federation have all come out of the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a man of average talent, who is incapable and unable to use the magic stone, the only thing that can rely on is his own brain and hands - using instruments Replacing the wings, getting rid of the gravitational constraints, and putting the heavy body on the blue sky is the right way forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win the air superiority, no winter city must form its own flying force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs to make a real airplane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland also knows that he still has several difficulties to solve from this goal, even the ancient World War I biplane is a complicated thing for him. ——The power output-brake system is not simpler than the train. It is enough to be a headache for several movable rudder surfaces of the aircraft. More critically, he has no experience in maneuvering the aircraft, so it is impossible to determine whether those mechanical devices will work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the glider plan can make up for this gap to some extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter, who can accurately feel the wind and wind changes is undoubtedly the best test pilot, plus the protection of lightning and wheat, he does not have to use human life at least Fill out a set of control manuals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty," Dr. Star’s reply pulled him out of his thoughts. "Your purpose, I received it, this observatory implements the mathematics institute as soon as possible. You made it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Roland nodded with satisfaction and thought that it would be the right choice to pack the entire astrological association into the West. As long as you explain the principle once, the other person can figure out what he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What’s more worrying is that the astrologers’ ability is as good as their mathematics. After all, the blacksmith can't figure out how to make a perfection. The stargazer, most of the equipment is their own order parts, hand-assembled. It seems that as a sage, the astrological association is not much more eclipsed than the alchemy association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was about to leave, the Bachelor of Stars seemed to have some words to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the case, Your Majesty," the bachelor coughed twice. "I have been a little unclear... this cover of Analytic Geometry, and you gave it to me. In those math books, why are the words intermediate? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't help but laugh out, "I just want to ask this?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is not convenient to disclose, please forgive me for the abruptness." Unlike Kemer Stoll, he stayed in the kingdom from birth and served the dispersion of several kings. The star obviously has to be more disciplined. It can be seen from his eyes that he is not more curious about the matter than the chief alchemist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought that he had used a "medium chemistry" to bind Kaimo to the carriage without the winter city, and it was taught by the disciples. I was a Minister of Chemical Industry and I couldn’t help but laugh. However, people like the Master of Stars, who are so sensible, naturally do not need to hang him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there is another discipline called higher mathematics. It is not pure geometry or arithmetic, but a combination of all advanced mathematical theories. If the first and intermediate books that I handed over to you are the trunks, the higher mathematics is the branches that are stretched out above, but this subject is too difficult...so it has another name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From entry to give up." Roland is a handkerchief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
