			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stood in the backyard of the firing room waiting for the first batch of cement to be released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brick house was designed for cement production and is about 15 meters long and 4 meters wide. There is a door in front and rear, the difference is that the front door is as spacious as possible for people to carry materials. The back door is only one person wide, allowing Anna to sneak into the firing room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, he built a wall around the half-waist of the house, encircling the second half of the firing room, and the entrance and exit arranged for the knights to guard them - they All of Carter’s subordinates, loyalty is beyond doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The production process of cement is very simple. After crushing limestone into powder, it is mixed with clay and iron powder, and the mature material is calcined by dry or wet method. It can be used by grinding with gypsum. The raw materials are very common, and the iron powder is difficult to produce in large quantities. The key is the calcination temperature of the clinker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific temperature required to burn cement Roland does not remember, even if he remembers he can't measure and control temperature - whether it is infrared thermometer or thermoelectric Even temperature guns are many times more complicated than cement. He only knows that this temperature is almost similar to the melting point of iron, and the calcination process is also a difficult problem in the production of cement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the era of underdeveloped smelting technology, maintaining the blast furnace temperature has always been a problem that plagues everyone. The heat loss of the ordinary open furnace is extremely large, and it is difficult to keep the furnace temperature above 1200 degrees. The reverberatory furnace needs a high temperature resistant liner, and he will not think about how to make refractory bricks for a while. The traditional iron-making blast furnace is even worse. The temperature may reach the standard, but the narrow furnace cavity is used to calcine the cement. I am afraid that even if the demon moon has passed, it will not burn enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no heating in the firing room designed by Roland, he relied on Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small-grained limestone crushed with clay is mixed with clay and mixed with water to form a slurry, which is evenly spread in the firing chamber. Then the Cavaliers locked the door and cleared the handyman. Anna enters from the back door and lets the flame bake the slurry on the ground until the iron rods that are placed together in the room melt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is somewhat restless, this is the first step in his stay in Bianbu Town. If you can't make cement, the plan to build a wall in three months is just empty talk. There is no wall blocking, I am afraid that no one is willing to stay in this ghost place. Whether it is real history or fictional literature, if you want to farm well, a stable base is essential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, can you really stick the stones together?" asked Carter Lannis, who was next to the Four Princes. Although the prince told him that this is the latest research results of the Grey Fortress Alchemy Workshop, he still believes. After all, the gang did not make any really reliable alchemy products. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows? Anyway, they say this," Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This world alchemy, together with astrology, is known as the Sage, and is very popular in mainland countries. The royal family will generally train their alchemists and astrologers for the refining of secret medicines and the prediction of fate. For ordinary people, these studies are too high, so that the mentality of blind faith has arisen. With this in mind, Roland naturally brought the source of the cement formula to the alchemy workshop. As for the chief knight, believe it or not, it doesn't matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame that comes out of the window is gradually extinguished, and it looks like it is burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland screamed to stand up and drive Carter out of the yard, waiting alone in front of the back door of the brick house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron gate slammed open and Anna squatted out. Roland put the robes on her for the first time, and gave her a glass of water. "How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witches’ face was gray, wet Although the legal cement has low dust, the hot air will still bring dust when it is calcined. For her who can't wear a mask, staying inside for dozens of minutes is obviously not too comfortable. She coughed twice and nodded. "The mud has turned into gray powder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can't wait for the temperature in the firing room to drop low enough, he will get wet The towel was wrapped around the head and grabbed the shovel into the back door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot air instantly surrounded him. He felt a little difficult to breathe at one time, and the skin on his hands was painfully roasted. Fortunately, it takes too much time to shovel a ash, otherwise it will be a few minutes in this environment to cause high temperature shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
