			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Camo Spoel made a resignation to Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t stay in the king for a few more days?" Roland joked. "This is the center of the Grey Fort. The places where you have fun are the most in the kingdom." Ok, I missed it this time. I don't know when I will come next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not you, I don't want to leave anything here. Love," Kaimo rolled his eyes. "There are a lot of work to do in the lab and the chemical plant. If you want the gunpowder production line to work properly, it is best to let me return to the winter city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party’s answer made Roland feel awkward. After the situation stabilized, the atmosphere in the city was a bit strange. First, I heard that many women called their lover, and later they even ran away. Out. Of course, he knows that these are all rumors, but they can't hold their mouths, especially the reputation of their own is really bad enough. No matter how bizarre the story is, people are convinced... In desperation, they have to let Tasa out and drive. The mouse extinguished the rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's okay," he nodded for a while, then nodded. "I will arrange a paddle steamer to send you back to the West." "You have been working hard these days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know." Kemo shook his beard and left after he took the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is really rude, Roland pouts, but he doesn't care, and even happily sings a little song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you are so happy with so many women," came a cold voice behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough..." He was almost slobbered. "What are you talking about! They just hope that they can borrow some money from this statement." You don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I know." The tone of the nightingale suddenly became a little flustered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Really don't know?" Roland countered. "I thought you were going to investigate everyone."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...well," the nightingale appeared in shape, turned over and sat on the desk, and stared at him. "I did investigate, but it was worried about you." Safety, I am afraid that you will take the unclear people into the palace, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand," he said with a smile, but the other party A word that came down made his smile solidify on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although most of them are fake, but how do Miss Kingfisher and Mrs. Roser count? They are not lying!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damn covenant, she did not expect that after the cover of the past, she actually kept in mind. Roland silently cursed the "old friend" a thousand times, while staring at her eyes and said: "I have not lied to you... The four princes in their mouth are really not me, you should be able to tell, this is not a lie. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale was stared at some uncomfortable, slightly distracted. "So this is a misunderstanding? They think it is you, but you are not on the scene." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not," Roland said in a words, "I have never seen them!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her expression calmed down. "Then those women who claim to have dyed you, let them continue to swear? Tassa said that you did not tell them to shut up."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, with the words of Golden Dragon, they are completely in the middle of their arms, and if they move their knives... they are too hot, and they will increase the suspicion of the people," Roland could not do because of this kind of thing. Just ordered to kill, "It’s better to make a big news to attract everyone’s attention than to force a blockade. . "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"? ...... big news "Nightingale puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s something that allows them to discuss for weeks," he smiled. "For example, Wang will be renamed Shuguang City, and there is no Western Wintertown is the new king of the Grey Fort and so on... After I left this place, these rumors will calm down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
