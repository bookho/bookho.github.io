			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the banquet, Roland recruited Lotus and Wendy into the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s okay to sleep on the island," he asked with a smile. "I hope that I took up Timie's time and didn't cause any trouble for you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Lian nodded, then whispered, "Yes... right, the scarf you sent me last time, I haven’t Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no need to be so cautious," Roland waved his hand. He knew that after a period of time, the familiar network that was originally established would be quite a lot. But this does not mean that the relationship between them disappears, but it is temporarily deposited... As long as the previous attitude is maintained, I believe they will soon be able to re-integrate into it. “It seems to be very different here, actually when you leave. There is no essential difference - just use no winter city as your home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Wendy touched her head, "You It’s still our sister.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well,” Lian seems to be embarrassed to bow her head, but her tone is obviously relaxed.  Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After you arrived at the castle, I always care about one thing...the two are called Iphi and Yu Yu, aren’t they sleeping on the island witch?” Roland After changing the topic, he noticed that both the introduction and the old ones were incompatible with other witches, although they would talk about one or two sentences, but compared to Lotus and Sylvie, Evelyn, Candlelight, etc. The enthusiasm of the enthusiasm, the difference is more obvious. And I don't know if it is an illusion. He always thinks that Evelyn and Candlelight are afraid of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, they really come from a sleepy island, just a little different from us..." Lian simply explained the origins of the two people. "I don't know Why did Li Daren come to the witch who sent the blood to the meeting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ife is a fighting witch?" Roland groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, she can summon the magical cage to capture enemies that are much stronger than her. Even if it is an ashes, if there is no stone of the gods It’s hard to get out of bed once you’re trapped.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What about Yu Yu?” Wendy asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is not a fighting witch, but her abilities are equally powerful," Lotus said. "Any object can be sticky under her touch. Once combined, they can't be separated until the ability fails—but according to her, as long as enough magic is invested, the stickiness can last for a long time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This ability should be very broad," Roland said. "The wolf witch named Herti Morgan actually agreed to send such a person?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The members of the bloody meeting are very powerful. The fighting witches don’t say much. The remaining non-combat witches also have outstanding abilities. The sleeping island is built so fast, a large part. The credit is attributed to them." Lian sighed and looked reluctant to admit it. "But they always feel that they are superior, and they often bully those witches who are incompetent. If it is not for Terry, I am afraid to go to the fjord. The witch must be less than half."<br /><br />&nb Sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original, he thought, this is probably the reason why Evelyn and the candlelight looked abnormal in front of them. "I know, you should rest well today," Roland comforted the lotus a few words, then looked at Wendy. "Their room arrangements will be handed over to you, temporarily let the witches of the bloody teeth stay a little farther, tomorrow. Conduct a detailed competency test."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty," Wendy said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two left, the nightingale appeared from his side and asked the fish fillet, "Don't you look for the two guys?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They haven’t had much problem since they haven’t left the island," Roland shrugged. "The witches going to the fjord don’t experience the same kind as the club." It’s not surprising that life and death are accompanied by a combination of multiple witch organizations. It’s not surprising that such a situation is happening.” The so-called party has no faction, and it’s strange that the witch alliance will expand, and sooner or later. However, party faction competition is not all harmful. As long as it constitutes healthy competition, it will increase the vitality of the alliance. "The only thing that puzzles me is why Tilly sent the fighting witch here. If I just want to let them be disciplined, the same is true for the witches, let alone the wind and the Terry side."
