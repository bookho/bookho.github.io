			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept aiming and shooting in the same time, until all the clips were lighted, and two giant shields fell down - Danny The precious bullets will be used on the trial warrior, and the thin armor looks very mighty, but even the guns can't stop it. The iron axe said that the gods of the church are extremely terrible opponents. The close combat can be an enemy, but the number is scarce and it is very troublesome to train. This is the goal worth hunting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason he hates the machine gunner is that the group of self-important guys, obviously using the same bullets as him, is surprisingly inefficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the only two live-fire exercises, a machine gun team emptied several boxes of bombs in half an hour, even the iron-axe adults showed distressed The expression can be judged according to the damage of the target. The number of bullets that they add up to the target is only a hundred, which is a waste of resources in Danny's eyes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he also understands the meaning of the Mark 1 machine gun - at least in dealing with enemies swarming like the tide, it can play a role in repressing the offensive momentum. . However, if you want to talk about the results of hunting, you still have to rely on their accurate shooters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bullet, an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where he rigorously trains himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny pulled out the magazine, and the heavy load was completed. When he got up and shot, there was a panting voice. He looked at it, it was the malt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, I am not asking you to stay in place?" He glanced at the little man. "You are violating the military order!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brian said that there is no special circumstances to leave his garrison position, and you also violated the military order," Malt wiped the sweat on his forehead, "as a protector, I have to be with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Danny resisted the urge to take him a shot and grabbed a bullet from his pocket and threw it at him. In front of them, "Put them on the magazine, nothing to show your head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow!" The little man pouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of his fifth victory, the enemy team suddenly changed. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the church commander also believes that this will not be able to rush to the front of the trenches, only to see the gods of the penalty forces to unify the giant shield, straight into the position The degree is so astounding that even the running horse is just like this in front of this group of people, and the distance between the two sides is shortening rapidly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revolver rifle and the machine gun rang at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Danny had a series of blood fog in front of him, and the dust on the ground was denser than the artillery bombardment, as if there was an invisible giant handcuffs. Shooting the warriors of the group, in front of this unstoppable force, the momentum of the charge slammed down slowly, and the people who hit it were all fluttering with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A god punished army was still flying forward after being interrupted by bullets. Danny just pointed his gun at him, and it consisted of dozens of dust columns. The "sand snake" leaned through the center of his body - the unique trajectory of the machine gun. The chest of the target suddenly swayed like a wave of water, the blue blood blasted behind him, and the hot air flow even tore his ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unbalanced god of the penalty army wrinkled like a rag, and still ran out three or four steps by inertia before falling to the ground, Danny noticed him The back is already gorgeous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, be careful!" The malt suddenly screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny was shocked. Just turned his head and saw another squad that had emerged from the sky and smoked a spear to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy then throws it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He barely sees the shadow of the spear shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About! Too focused on watching the enemy noticed himself, the hunter should not be exposed to the prey for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
