			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the appointment and dismissal was announced, everyone took the oath of office in accordance with Roland’s request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process officials are still seeing for the first time, but the novelty is novel, everyone is still doing it meticulously, and many people are still deliberately taller. chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oath itself has nothing special, "be loyal to the king, do his duty" - this is what every courtier often hangs, but in such a formal Occasionally, when the faces and voices of the people come out, it seems to be tangible, as if it has a meaning that cannot be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows that they are gradually merging into one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you have passed the inauguration ceremony, then it is time to start working." He stood up from the main position and took a palm to the back of the wall. On the map, "to completely sweep the threat of the devil out of the fertile plains, to ensure the security of the northwest of the winter city, and to lay the foundation for the return of mankind to the hinterland of the mainland - this is the main goal of the gray castle next year!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of two wars of divineness has pushed people to the desperate step by step, behind the sea, and there is no way to retreat. From the perspective of living resources or strategic sense, Westward is the only way out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to gain a foothold on the vast plains, you must pull out the nail of Tacila - without the god stone, the devil can not stand the monument The Grey Fort can really get a safe frontline territory. After that, whether it is concentrating development or waiting for an anti-attack, its initiative will be in its own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, human actions do not need to rely on red fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the technical power reaches the qualitative change, the scope of the weapon's attack will also be greatly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow, squat!" The crowd whispered in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting, Roland returned to the office, and the nightingale had placed the brewed black tea at his desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Working hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is still a relaxed look, the fish with a dizzy mouth It shows that the mood is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...thank you," Roland picked up the fragrant teacup, and suddenly thought of Anna’s words last night, and couldn’t help but look at it. The other side has two eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the agreement? Anna has not elaborated on it, but in the morning, the throne ceremony and the wedding banquet held in the evening, the nightingales are staying with everyone, how can we not see it? It is like being able to complete the "contract". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This puzzle really makes him a little unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland faintly felt that if they asked each other directly, neither would tell him the real answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Just then, the sound of the nightingale suddenly came from the ear. "I look so beautiful today?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...hey," he hurriedly sipped his tea to cover up his loss. "I mean, that's right..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it "yes" or "no"? "The latter leaned over and put his face in front of him. Roland could even smell the fragrance from her hair. "Your heart is in chaos." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not waited for him to return, the nightingale has already gone away, leaning on the lounge chair, smugly chewing the dried fish.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware that she was teasing herself, Roland shook her head helplessly, but at the same time she was a little grateful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, At least one thing he can be sure of.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is the nightingale he is familiar with.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** ****************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What is the speed now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ear of lightning is full of whistling sounds, even the mouth is very difficult, if you speak in the wind, I am afraid that the tongue will be torn open by the blade. She had to run the magic and launch the "coherence." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the bitter chill disappeared from the face, and the wind noise dropped to a level that could be tolerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mc茜, what is the speed now?" she asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I look at you!" The latter drilled half a head from the collar under her neck. "It’s almost twice as big as the Grey Eagle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably related to the beast instinct, for the speed judgment, Mai Hao has excellent perceptual ability, compared with the estimated speed according to the magic consumption, bring her to fly together Obviously more convenient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the speed of 300 kilometers per hour?" Lightning sighed slightly. When the Grey Eagle swooped from the sky to the prey, the speed could reach 150 kilometers per Hours, few targets can escape such attacks. Now she has far surpassed the Grey Eagle, but she is not happy in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred kilometers... This is the limit of flying without coherence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the evolution of her ability, she spent a lot of time to become familiar with her new abilities and mastered the skills to actively control the magical coherence. In other words, as long as she can tolerate all kinds of discomfort at high speeds, she can always keep consumption to a minimum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Roland also updated her with a full range of equipment, such as a circular mirrored windshield, double insulated lining, and less resistance. The close-fitting backpack is the ultimate in weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This series of measures allowed her to continuously break through her own record of flat flight, but the physical constraints still exist. It seems that the speed of 300 kilometers per hour may be difficult. Passover is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the coherence is developed, the speed of magic consumption will increase dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning can't help but admire the strong fitness of the superb witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the ability is determined at the moment of awakening, she can use it, only the day after day efforts to temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to No Winter City, she can ask Luo Jia how to train a more powerful body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Attention!" Mai Hao suddenly shouted in her arms. "We are less than a hundred kilometers away from the ruins of Taqila!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Lightning closed his eyes and felt the magic stock in the body, then tilted his mouth. "Let us surprise the devil." Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After mastering the new abilities, His Majesty finally agreed to her search for the game... No, the request for investigation - even at the lowest cruising speed She is also far faster than those clumsy beasts. As long as the magic is planned, the possibility of danger is negligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lightning is not satisfied with this, she always remembers the wild land three years ago, in the ruins of the stone tower, the devil's ice sculpture is scared of the shameless scene. As an explorer, he has lost his guts, and such shame must be compensated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear comes from the unknown, and now the devil is not a terrible monster for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning, firepower is full!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hear this sentence, the pigeon immediately shrinks Into the collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl began to improve her speed. Even with the protection of the same tone, she can feel the sharp increase in the wind, from a sharp scream to a thick roar. The earth's earth is like a viscous lotion, not only the outline becomes blurred, but the signs of backward movement become more and more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
