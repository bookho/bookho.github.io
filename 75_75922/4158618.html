			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"叮铃铃铃......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone on the table suddenly rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rosmine Orchid took a few seconds to find out which part of the machine was waiting to be connected, and leaned over to pick up the handset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The label on the phone indicates that the caller is an empty knight college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more and more access to the office, he had to add a small table at his desk to specifically place these calls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? I will come right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hanging up the receiver, Roland is exposed I like to stand up and pick up the coat hanging from the chair and put it on my body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tilly calls?" The nightingale raised an eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the preparations for the big plane have been completed and will soon be tested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp His so-called big plane is the key project of the Grey House Design Bureau - the four-speed long-range bomber. After learning that it was possible to obtain a mobile landing field, he first asked the relevant technical personnel about the feasibility of the replacement. The answer is that as long as the weight is adjusted slightly, there will be no effect on the aerodynamics. However, the replacement of the Phoenix engine will bring about a significant drop in performance, such as taking longer runways for take-off, carrying up to half of the internal oil, reducing the range to about one-third of the original, etc... In short, the new aircraft is in various The indicators can no longer meet the requirements of the previous long-distance attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its only benefit is the ability to see results immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The engine of the Phoenix is ​​still an improved star engine. Anna has completely figured it out in more than a year, compared to the bomber. Large inline engines are much more mature – even if the design bureau provides all the large drawings, the prototypes must be tested first, which will inevitably slow down the entire project. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at the beginning of the plan, the bomber was put into the "One-Year Plan", which is already a very bold plan for the Winter City. . Even if there are no accidents in the R&D process, it should be half a year away from normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not for the masked monarch, let Roland realize that the god of God has the same ability to die, and not too long a year. But now, the situation has become very different - once the god of God has risen to the sky at the cost of overdrafting the stone, even if it can destroy its core, it will not save the great damage caused by its fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus humans now have an empty island-like floating island, the performance of the bomber lost is no longer unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the twisted-in twisted cable, Roland walked over to the door while wearing a coat. "Let's go and see it, this is the biggest airplane ever!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哐当——"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he crossed the mahogany long table, the flipped corner suddenly Brought to the teapot at the table, and when Roland realized it, the body had been irreversibly tilted toward the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." The nightingale seemed to move, and the figure disappeared for a short while, but it was still too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teapot is like an invisible object, and it’s half a lap in the air before it falls on the stall. It’s broken into several pieces, just soaked in heat. Tea also sprinkled on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You seem to be slowing down," Roland said. "In the past, you have never lost a hand, will it be a snack? Too much weight?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The nightingale did not repay the mouth, but looked at his hand in confusion.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here let the maids clean up, let's go to the Cavaliers Academy, and Tilly is still waiting there. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
