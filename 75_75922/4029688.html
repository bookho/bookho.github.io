			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to sending a formal reply to Roland Wimbledon, he also wrote a private letter to Itis. The letter euphemistically expressed his thoughts - the young king did not stand up, and if he could go further with Roland, he would be more reassured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no real love in the political marriage, or love is not the protagonist, this has no doubt about the North Pearl. He believes that this is an excellent opportunity, especially in the future, there will be no further power to divide, which means that the king will become the only aristocrat of the entire gray castle, and the status of the queen is extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calvin believes that her daughter can read her own thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are not only given no response, even the same is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't tell me because you don't like him," the Duke poured himself a third cup of black tea. "I haven't seen you like anyone, and that It doesn't matter at all... Since you would consider mentioning Feike in the past, why don't you consider Roland now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not the same, father."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the difference, aren't they all kings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis closes the notebook "Tefico needs an ally that can be trusted in the North, or a man, and the guarantee is a marriage. If I disagree, he will kick the Kant family and support a willing to listen. In other words, if you don’t become a queen, the status of the family is in jeopardy, and we can’t do anything. So I can only drag it first. If Roland and his western world fail completely, then I will follow the rules of the nobility and marry into the palace. But...Roland doesn't need it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""No need" is Do you mean? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He chose me only because of ability, not the things behind me... family, territory, wealth are not important in his eyes. "The daughter licked the falling tip. "Since the nobility and the rules no longer exist, why should I limit myself to those old frames? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know? She went on to say, "In the town hall where he manages no winter city, there are only a handful of officials from the aristocracy - most of them from ordinary civilians, after a round of assessment. I have to admit that they are really bad in most respects, but at least they do their job, not much worse than the average aristocrat. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the new rule of your Majesty. As long as you can complete the work for him, you don't have to worry about losing your position." Therefore, you should also lose the old one as soon as possible and adapt to the new policy promulgated by the City Hall, so as not to drag my hind legs. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But even then, becoming a queen has no harm to you," the Duke still didn't want to give up. "You can still show your abilities, and He gave birth to a prince... In this way, the Kant family will become an inseparable ally of the royal family, and your younger brother will have a guarantee in the future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Itis rarely showed a hesitant color. "I am afraid I can't do this." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland squats...he seems to believe in love. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke frowned. "Is he interested?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, witch. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""? "He suddenly suspected that his ears were out of order.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The book said that Roland would marry a witch as a wife," said Itis frankly. The book is also a witch, working in the city hall as the Minister of Education. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Political marriage? Calvin can only think of this answer, "but it is too... ridiculous, the witch can not give birth to future generations!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not a political marriage, just because he likes the witch," she leaned back on the chair and played with the quill in her hand. "Yes, in In the future marriage, love is the protagonist - it sounds incredible, but I don't know why, after a month of contact with him, I believe it. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
