			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this way, our mission is over?" On the square, the cat's claws cleaned up the debris from the burning of the bonfire, unfortunately, " I really don't want to go back to work in the mine. Really, I have a little bit of nostalgia for the demon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I don't want to follow Those stones deal with each other," the pomelo peel should be vocal, "The most important thing is that there is too much salary difference. Where there is work like the artillery team, there is meat every day, and there are 15 silver wolves per month. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the stupid thing to say," said Fanna, who was holding the torch at the side, didn't have a good air. "This time it is much more distributed by the Prince." In the first two years, half of the people in the old district did not survive the winter! Do you still miss it? Besides, the team will not be disbanded, and the Highness will recruit us into the artillery team and burn it. So many gunpowder, just to hear it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the evil beast is gone, and the Highness is still the artillery team. What? "Rodney asked, leaning on a broom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artillery team was not prepared for the evil beast. When Fanna thought about it, he finally did not say it. "In short, we will know the answer tomorrow," he said. I yawned and waved impatiently. "Come clean up here. I want to go back to bed early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, ringing The collection number of the Che Ying District confirmed the statement of Fanner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone gathered, the iron axe stood in front of the line and said loudly: "You have completed the first phase of the mission - defending the border town After the three-month and six-day battles, you have been recognized by your Highness! The next militia team will be adapted into the regular army of His Royal Highness. If you are unwilling to continue fighting, you can stand up now. Your Highness said, At the moment, leaving the militia team, all the pay is paid, and 25 silver wolves are reissued as..." He thought about his Highness, "Well, decommissioning fee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No one of the three hundred people moved, only the cat claws raised their hands: "Report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also one of the weird rules laid by His Royal Highness under training. Players must not whisper in private, and must report the matter first when inquiring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe nodded, "said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does the regular army mean? Is it a knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna couldn’t help but burst into laughter, but he quickly reverted to a serious face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knight? That is a nobleman, not only has the industry and the envy, but also the land. Being able to ask such a question is really the face of the artillery team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," the iron axe explained patiently, apparently he also asked His Royal Highness, "The regular army is a full-time army engaged in combat, only to protect the temple and protect the highness. In other words, when the workers are mining in the mine, you are training, when the farmer harvests the wheat, you are training, and when the merchant sells the goods, you are still training. All the training is for future battles. Winning is like what you did when the demon moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the difference between the militia and the militia?" asked the cat's claw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More frequent training, more rigorous systems, and more generous returns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Report!" This is Rodney. After the iron axe nodded, he couldn't wait to ask, "What is the more generous reward?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fan sigh With a sigh of relief, why are the boys in their group so impetuous? Although he also wants to know the answer to this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The regular army will implement the officer system. If the combat mission is completed according to the specified plan during the battle, or if there is outstanding performance, the officer can be promoted." The iron axe said loudly, " For example, stand in my position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the Highness said? Fanna thought, if it is implemented, isn’t it encouraging everyone to commit? ? He sneaked around and looked around, but everyone seemed to be unaware of the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
