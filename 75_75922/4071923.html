			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can really figure it out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether the central carrier uses the accumulation method or the column multiplication, the answer can be obtained in an instant, indicating that her computing power is far more than the average person, even if only The answer is yes or no, it is also very helpful for the mathematics institute. At least it can be used to check results and reduce the error rate of large complex operations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland happily crouched down and patted the subject. "You are really amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The red light is extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, she can't communicate with you," Pasha reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can understand what I said and answer yes or no. This is already an exchange." The essence of communication is reception and feedback, at most Said to be limited by the output, can not talk like normal people. He did not care to wave his hand, and maybe he should try it. Whether she really can only make a positive and negative statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thing a luminous tentacle as one, two as two, and so on, can you use red light to represent three?" Roland thought for a while. Asked the opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question is much simpler than the five-digit multiplication, but the implications are not very general. If the answer is yes, it means she can pass Complex expressions to extend the feedback content, coupled with superior computing power, can directly display the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the hub carrier did not respond immediately as before. After the interest rate, one of the tentacles glowed red, the other shimmered, and the last one did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Catherine’s statement, one light, one weak, one weak and one destroyer represents 30% correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the answer did not last long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twilight of the roots quickly went out, and even the tentacles that started to glow red light faded after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer now has become negative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your problem is beyond her ability," Celine sighed. "If the answer is yes, then it means she needs to answer yes or no, which will aggravate her confusion." She paused and went on, "In fact, we also I tried to make the central carrier express a simple meaning, even a short sentence, but once it exceeds the simple right or wrong judgment, her recovery speed will be greatly reduced, and it is easy to fall into chaos as it is now."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, is this a logical obstacle? Roland frowned. "She's like this... doesn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as she takes a break, she will recover," said Celine, posing. I also asked some contradictory questions, and as a result, she ignored us for half a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the bio-computer is not so easy to get started, he Imagine that since the central carrier can judge the calculation result, it means that she does know the answer. The key is how to display the answer in the original appearance. Perhaps it is necessary to find a way to answer with both yes and no, and to make complex expressions. The method is only hopeful to achieve this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the idea is beyond the scope of his knowledge, the code farmer and the science and technology double dog themselves are hostile to each other, the professional content has almost no overlap, a little thought After a while, Roland gave up his intention to study alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I remember you said that the carrier needs to maintain its vitality through dirt and heat. Is there any magma here?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fulan has not yet dug so deep, but we have found a boiling river, there should be a lava zone nearby." Pasha replied, "In addition to this dark river There is often a scent of sulfur, and the feeling of soaking is not bad. If you want to ask the central carrier, we will take a lot of hot water every few days to shower her, so you don't have to worry about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s equal to saying that magma is not a necessity and hot water can make do with it. This is undoubtedly good news. If you want to turn her into the computing yard, just provide a boiling water boiler to meet her life needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
