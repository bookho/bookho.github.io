			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Ai Gesha got a fine parchment roll from Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Contract. After pressing the fingerprint, you officially belong A member of the Witch Alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spread the paper roll and read the contents of the paper in detail, and said, "So?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" The other party doesn't seem to understand what she means, "Which?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The constraints are meaningless," Ai Gesha pointed to the "effective content" line. "I only mentioned that I can't betray Bianbu Town without violating the consensus of the two sides, but there is no binding measure. If you really want to betray, I am afraid There is no psychological pressure. And the above words are too rigorous. Is this really a contract?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I was handwritten It’s just a form.” The prince nodded, not surprisingly. It seemed that he was not a person who pointed out that there was a problem with the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are a lot of holes in the form." She secretly licked her belly, poked her ink and pressed her handprints. The alliance contract has very few requirements for both parties. According to the above terms, there is basically no change after joining. Although she felt that she was doing a little more, she felt a lot easier in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s said that it’s a collaboration with a mortal, but she knows clearly that this gray-haired man is the actual leader of the Witch Alliance. If she wants to work for a mortal with respect to the top of the federation or the Lord of the Three Cities, she may not accept it. Looking at it now, at least you have considerable freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland collected the sheepskin roll and curiously asked, "What is the contractual constraint in Taqila?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is only needed when recruiting mortals, from ** punishment to mental torture," she grinned. "As for us, there is no need to sign such a thing. The federation is a lifelong system. Once joined, the defector has only one dead end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," he took a breath. "Welcome to join the Witch Alliance. Remember to come to the castle after breakfast." At the glance of the garden, I need to fully test your abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capability testing The process is simpler than that that Geshasha imagines. Demonstrate the various features of the abilities in front of the prince, and then answer a few questions and finish it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magical form is a sky-blue pentagonal prism with a medium level of accommodation. The type is summoned, and the ability has been evolved once. The initial performance is to create low temperatures. After evolution, it can achieve constant temperature consolidation, which is very convenient," Roland asked after recording. "Are you so that your ability has evolved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Continuous practice and an accidental epiphany,” she said proudly. As the youngest high-level awakened person, everyone at the federation called her “Tacilla's genius”. “I try to make it every day. The temperature dropped even lower, allowing the water to freeze quickly. Until one day, I witnessed a witch who controlled the flame melt a piece of lead into a liquid, and as the flame continued to roast, the lead began to boil."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This scene made me realize that perhaps everything has three states: gaseous, liquid and solid - lead is solid at room temperature, but as long as the temperature is high enough, it can be As a gas; water is liquid at normal temperature, at temperature If it is, it will solidify into ice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gas that appears to be gaseous at normal temperature will not be like lead, as long as the temperature is low enough Freezing up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With this idea, I quickly felt that the magic of the body produced a completely different change, and eventually I was promoted to a high-level witch. And this epiphany was also recorded in the "Wan Fa Tong Jie"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she is still the youngest recipient of this book, even three at the time Xi has praised himself and believes that this epiphany not only has a great enlightening effect on the promotion of witches, but also is of great significance to the study of reality. However, when she solemnly said this, the performance of the other party was quite calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
