			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knocked on the door and heard the response from the nightingale before pushing the door into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thick curtains in the room, which will only be ventilated when it is early in the morning and evening, and closed at other times to keep warm and shade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only light source comes from the two candlesticks at the end of the bed. The candle burns quietly, projecting the two shades of shadow in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to the bed and looked at the woman who was buried in a soft velvet pillow and bedding, still closed, and sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the border defense still okay?" The nightingale handed him a cup of warm water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything is going well," Roland casually sipped and handed the cup back to her. "From that day on, I have never encountered a large group of evil beasts." After the injured militia members returned to the team, everyone’s enthusiasm for fighting became...something high.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Where is the wall damaged?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kar used the rolling wood to move the carapace of the mixed species to the fracture, and also hang it with a winch and a wooden frame to make it a wall. Part of it," Roland knows that the nightingale asks to distract himself, lest he be overly worried. But as soon as he stepped into the room, all his consciousness could not help but gather him into the sleeping woman on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the last time you faced a large-scale invasion of the evil beast, you can still achieve a proud victory. The biggest hero is no doubt that Anna, if she does not use flames Blocking the gap in the city wall, the consequences are simply unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after she fainted in her arms, she never woke up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been a week," Roland whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, if a person is in a coma, do not eat or drink for a week, and there is no external direct supply of nutrients (such as injection), the body function will fall into exhaustion The brain will gradually die in shock. But Anna didn't have any signs of weakness and illness – at least a lot better than when she first fell. Her cheeks are rosy, her breathing is steady, and her hands can be felt on the forehead. Everything shows that Anna is in a healthy state, just... can't wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was also the first time I encountered such a situation," the nightingale standing on the side shook her head. "The magic in her body was consumed in that battle." Empty, but now it has become saturated, even more intense than before. If I did not make a mistake, midnight is her adult day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Say she will be adult in a coma?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, she will die in a coma," the night screamed, "the pain of adulthood, It must be overcome with the will. Once the resistance is abandoned, the magic of the anti-phasing will irreversibly destroy the witch's body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland moved the chair and sat by the bed Next, "But I remember you said that when the demon phagocyst, no matter how painful, the consciousness will always stay awake, either through this level or choose to end life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is true that some people in the Aid have wanted to use the coma to get through the demon phagosome. It is not an adult day... It’s just a torment that must be tolerated once a year,” the nightingale hesitated, continuing. “She relied on alchemy drugs to make herself sleepy, but that’s meaningless... when she retorted, she instantly woke up and lost her ability to resist. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this pain not increase gradually?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, when When that moment comes, the pain will come like a thunder, but how long it lasts will vary from person to person. My sister is not strong enough, just..." Her voice went down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland understands her meaning, the judgment of unknown time limit itself is a kind of torture, I don’t know how long I have been persisting, I don’t know how long I have to insist— - Like a lonely boat drifting in the rough sea, it is easy to give up the desire to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence, he felt a hand pressed on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this was not the end he hoped for. Roland closed his eyes and recalled the scene when she met her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is naked* with bare feet, her clothes are ruined, she is in a cage, but her face is not afraid, her eyes are like a lake that has never been polluted. Clear and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a flame, but does not escape like a flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture is rotated one by one, such as a lantern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have satisfied your curiosity, adults, can you kill me now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I never used it to hurt others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just want to stay with my Highness, nothing more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The demon phagocyst kills me, I will defeat it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you dreaming? I am not anywhere Go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suppresses the turbulent thoughts and whispers, "I Will accompany her to the last minute."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am, and... thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After dinner, Nana Va also came, and she heard that Anna was about to spend her adulthood, and she insisted on staying. Roland had to arrange a room on the second floor to spend the night with the accompanying Tiguin Pine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Roland and the two witches sat around the bed like this, waiting quietly for midnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Nightingale and Nana, they also have to suffer from the demon pharyngeal body this winter, but fortunately everyone’s awakening day is not the same, otherwise The three witches were all tested at the same time, and Roland estimated that he could no longer hold the room calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no bell tower in the town, and in the room where the candlelight is twilight, the passage of time becomes blurred. The cold wind blew the window, and from time to time I could hear the whistling sound as the airflow swept through the window. Just as Roland felt a little tired and hit his heart, the nightingale suddenly said: "Begin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only she can see that the magic in Anna’s body begins to change. Uneasy, the green flames became more and more intense, the center part was turned from incandescent, and the arrogant magic gathered at the center, like what was pulled, it struggled, rolled, but to no avail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not see these changes, but he also noticed something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame at the top of the candle swayed, and there was no wind in the room. The light from the flame is getting darker and darker, as if it is being swallowed by the shadows around it, and then the color of the flame tip changes - the orange-red fire turns into a green flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the woman in the bed, Anna was still asleep, her face did not change, as if it had nothing to do with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candlelight is almost completely hidden at this time - not the flame is extinguished, but the green flame is consuming the orange-red part little by little until the light disappears completely. Everyone is in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon, the fire re-lighted up. Only this time, the flame on the candlestick turned into pure green. The three people are under a green light, and they have big eyes and narrow eyes. It is a bit difficult to understand what this is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Anna’s screams pulled the eyes of the three men back to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly opened her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna..." Roland stopped, she woke up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman blinked and smiled at him, then extended her right hand, spread her hand and handed it to the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of green fires jumped out of the palm and quietly burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
