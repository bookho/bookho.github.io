			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning back to the camp tent, remove the goggles and gloves, and put some of the frozen numb hands over the brazier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fingertips suddenly received a burning and subtle tingling sensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost half a month since the winter has passed, but the snow has not weakened at all, but has recently become bigger and bigger. Every time the investigation came back, she could feel the wetness of her head, and the skin on her face would take a while to restore consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the hands were slightly warmer, she moved to a bench and sat next to the brazier, then took off the boots that were wet with snow and put their feet on On the fire. It can be clearly seen that the front end of the cotton socks has a white air, and the cold toes have a hint of warmth. As for the taste... The little girl was embarrassed to lick her head, stuffed in her boots for so long, and always had some sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now she finally knows why her father would emphasize that there should be a great team behind a great explorer to support it. Without the first military to prepare the brazier or even the hot water, she couldn't fully devote herself to the exploration - just thinking of returning to the camp in a cold, and having to make a fire by himself, the enthusiasm for exploration is simply A devastating blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but probably only the team under Roland’s, can you supply hot water all day long in the wild...Lightning. In the father's adventure stories, it is very difficult to wash a hot bath in the big winter. Wet firewood, snow-covered rot leaves, and the extra physical strength required to collect them have become obstacles to bathing. Therefore, most of the time, members of the adventure group will only have the opportunity to thoroughly cleanse the body after the expedition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the machines built by the Majesty have completely changed all of this - the camp is built not far from the river bank, the boilers on the three cement boats have not been extinguished To provide a continuous stream of hot water for the entire camp. When you want to use it, just pick it up with a bucket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the food is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a uniquely shaped cement boat that handles everyone’s rations. Its upper level is a mobile kitchen that uses the steam of the boiler to cook every day. A large number of wheat porridge, accompanied by boiled dried meat and salted fish, is better than the hard food of the hard state. I don't know where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the father’s standards, this is probably the best logistics team in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After baking hot hands and feet, Lightning took out her notebook and began recording today’s adventures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the 16th of the Spring, the excavation continues, and the thick mountains hinder the ability of Sylvie and Maggie, especially the latter - in the rock formations. Walking through will increase the magic consumption. In order to ensure safety, each search must reserve enough magic to return, so there is no way to sneak too deep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the distance limit, Sylvie can only choose a few directions, so Miss Fran tries to dig. By the way, Miss Fran looks terrible, but her character is unexpectedly sweet. It is more terrible to eat than Mickey. I really hope that she can have a day to restore her original appearance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment I arrived at the foot of the snow-capped mountains, it is now the thirteenth day of the expedition. The only thing that is certain at the moment is that there are huge holes in the mountains, and they are connected by many cave groups. It’s not easy to find out the main hole that may have remains. Not to mention a spacious passage for the First Army to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, she and Mai Hao can't help too much, can only be responsible for peripheral security work, or enter those strange caves, explore The magical ark is not easy to cross the deep trench and the mountain fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding the right path to your destination is always the most time-consuming and cost-intensive job than exploring the mysteries of the remains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a father often said that the explorer is always on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl took a sigh of relief in her hand and then wrote down -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Finally, the most outstanding explorer of Grey Castle, the new discovery of lightning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
