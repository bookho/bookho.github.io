Use the blood of the witch and the stone of the gods to transform The warrior, but unfortunately, because of the lack of key steps, the warrior becomes a defective product with no soul. You have hoped to defeat the devil with this empty body, but now the real finished product is called "monster". ? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real...complete? "Tefren's heart has set off a wave of turmoil! The method of making the Prisoner's Penalty can be said to be the core secret of the church, but the other party seems to know not only about it, but also far more than he knows.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free attack, kill them! The presiding judge shouted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten godly warriors swarmed up and crossed the archbishop with great speed, and rushed toward the enemy.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, their opponents are also godly warriors, even stronger than them.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number is clearly similar, but these people use the withdrawal Inducing, splitting and encircling, instantly formed a situation of more than playing. When a god-martial warrior stabbed with the enemy, there will be other people’s sneak attacks behind it. Even Teflon can see it, this time is correct. The practice should be to withdraw the sword, but the judge may not be able to separate the energy to control the ten people at the same time. Once the other party's strength does not fall, the disadvantages of the gods will be apparent.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is a warrior, once it is split into two, there is no ability to fight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soon ten gods All fell, and the other party did not break.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the "Ellington" will finally rush After the trial judge easily cut down, raised the sword and put it on the shoulder of the old bishop who could not move.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue blood and the presiding scarlet The blood mixed together and slid into his collar a little bit along the blade.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...can’t kill me," Tefren trembled. "If I die, the holy city will collapse completely... At that time, who will stop the evil beasts? If they are allowed to break through the Hermes defense line, the four kingdoms will probably fall into--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Into the destruction? The other party interrupted. "You use these words to deceive the outsiders who are ignorant and ignorant, and save energy in front of me." We all know what the evil beast is looking for. If you didn't bring it here, how could the brainless idiots be in the snowy trap with nothing in the magical moon? Drill? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...I don't understand what you mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? It seems that you haven't even seen the relics," shrugged the warrior with a face in Ellington. "It's a pity." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefron just wanted to say something, suddenly felt a cold neck, a numbness and cold feeling instantly occupied his consciousness.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Lian Na kicked the old man's head and flew out, watching the other's body slowly fall down, and then retracted the sword with satisfaction. "Go, it's time to do business." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, you are hurt," someone dragged her behind him. "First stop the blood, or the body will get out of control." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the wound? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The waist cracked a hole and you had to take off your armor." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This damn body doesn't feel at all," Elena snorted and untied the two front and rear decks, revealing a strong upper body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hey, this figure is placed in Tachair with at least fifty gold dragons. Someone interjected, "To be honest, do you have a mirror..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get it, Betty, what is the difference between fantasy and torture?" "The person who helped Elena stop the bleeding interrupted. "I didn't even dare to think about the days in Taqila. I remembered the life at that time, and now it is no different from being imprisoned in a cage of nothingness. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
