			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Roland unexpected is that the other party is not as usual It’s quite hesitant to blurt out the answer, which is very rare for the first military commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original question was just a casual question. He suddenly came to the interest--Roland didn’t think that the iron axe would have any ulterior motives, not to mention that the full responsibility itself included the means of disposal, it was burning. There is no essential difference between death or hang. He is curious that since the situation is not a violation of the order, then the hesitation of the other side is worth playing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not choose to continue to apply pressure, just leaning on the back of the chair and waiting for the answer from Mo Jinren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the iron axe stunned for a while, suddenly collapsed. "No, your majesty... The removal of the enemy aristocracy is a solution provided by Miss Itis, but The specific implementer is me, so I should take full responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis? Roland is stunned. Is this the plan of the staff? No, he didn't see this related content in the plan, so... is it private? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the thoughts, he understood why the other person hesitated. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the age of this private soldier, all things related to the military are considered to be the forbidden area of ​​the lord, and the most excuses for outsiders to intervene, even if it is a favorable war situation suggestion and reminder . If it happens in the territory of other nobles, the private proponent must be inevitably punished, and the iron axe does not want to even get tired of Itis, and does not want to cover it with lies, only the beginning of the tangled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, you have handled the war on the Eastern Front very well. After that, the City Hall will draw up rewards based on the results of the game. Let's go ahead."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axe axe, "Your Majesty, don't you punish me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can't help Laughed, "Why? Do you have any violations of the regulations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My order is to eliminate the rebels in the East and to include their city in my rule. The specific process is up to you." He paused. "If you are inspecting the military camp, you will hear two soldiers." When discussing the situation, and you adopted their opinions, should I punish you and these two people? Moreover, Itis is a member of the staff, and it is normal to think about the combat strategy."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So...do you think that we are not at fault?" The iron axe couldn’t help but look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't say that," Roland shrugged. "You don't have problems, it doesn't mean that Isis doesn't, but the next thing has nothing to do with you. Go back and have a good rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe opened his mouth and seemed to want to say something more, but finally chose to follow the order under his gaze, "Yes. "Your Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first commander of the army left, Roland immediately mentioned the city hall's special line, "Notify that Itis came to the castle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a quarter of an hour, the North Pearl appeared at the door of the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, this is my responsibility," said Itis, opening, "I will accept any punishment you have."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at her with interest. "I haven’t spoken yet, do you know what I am going to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The East Line Army just returned to the Winter City, your first call is definitely an iron axe. If he did not report to you about the burning of the nobility, I think you will not call me so soon. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to talk to a wise man, Roland thinks, and seeing this kind of open-minded appearance, people can't help but think that she is the loyal minister of the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the smarter, sometimes the easier it is to fall into the dead end of your own pile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I met the commander of the First Army in an informal setting and did not apply to you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wrong," Roland directly interrupted, "You The problem is that it violates the regulations of the General Staff. According to the regulations, any operational plan needs to form a paper record and be reviewed by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis is obviously I didn't expect him to say this, and couldn't help but widen his eyes, "Your Majesty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it not?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Northland Pearl’s face is incomprehensible. “Once it’s executed in your name, is this something that you’ve done in the eyes of other officials?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right," Roland raised his lips. "Is there any problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This..." Like Iron Axe, Itis also had a rare confusion. "They are rebels, but... they are also nobles. In the eyes of some nobles, your approach is probably..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know what you want to say," Roland waved his hand. "But if I can't resist it, do you think you can withstand this counterattack?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's relax, I just want to talk to you, you I really think that it is the right thing to take the ministry to the top?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Top...pot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "Cough, you understand the meaning of shirking responsibility." Roland said, "Go back to this matter, obviously for the Grey Fort Kingdom, and finally not only did not receive honor, but died because of this, I feel comfortable and even clap my hands - if they are known by others, will those officials be loyal to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the king is the most suitable person to be responsible. Only in this way, the following people will not have any burden when doing things. Because of this, I need to review the final plan of the staff, even if it is something I am not good at, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long while, Northland Pearl nodded "I am arrogant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The penalty for violating the regulations is that all the credit for this two-line offensive is cancelled, and you can get promoted." Roland drank a cup of tea. "This is where you will be. You will continue to be busy with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, please let me retire." Tiss caressed the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So... are you doing this white?" Cole Kant carefully pushed the honey-salted mushrooms to the front of Isis, then looked at the other side and forked the fork into the mushroom pieces. "Other colleagues can get it." Promotion, you didn't?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I don't have it." Northland Pearl chewed the bird with a yellowed heart, as if venting dinner. Dissatisfied with the general, "You listened to what you said, "If I can't resist it, can you withstand this counter-attack?" Just can't stand it, you need a vent. Of course, if it is a lord like my father, I will definitely not do this. I know that my Majesty will not ignore it. I feel that this investment will not be too bad, and the risk is still manageable, but he will put it in two or three sentences. I have done all the work, I still think too much, idealists are so naive! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃... sister, are you angry? Cole wiped the fine sweat on his forehead.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, can't you see it?" "Itis squinted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter quickly narrowed his neck, and he was the first time he saw the long sister showing such an expression on a non-banquet occasion - For more than a decade, Cole clearly knew how much his sister loved power. If it was as she said, because it lost the opportunity for promotion, whether it was annoyance, complaint or disappointment, but... ...not her expression tells him like this, it is more like a mixed anger... strange smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
