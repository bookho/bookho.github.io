			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." After reading the letter, everyone fell into a strange silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Benis was not willing to mutter, "I know that I should not be blessed by the four princes - think about him in the king." I often thought of going to the place and the wind, I thought that he would become a..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Aegola pulled the other’s arm, " Cautiously, the aristocrats who come and go here are all supporters of His Majesty the King. If not, they will pretend to be. If you are heard by you, you will only be in trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenqin sighed. "We are not expected to set foot in the new king's territory in this life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not bad, "We are very popular here?" said Egpo, comforting. "Or, in addition to the absence of the Winter City, the Kajin Theatre can be called a first-class drama team, and it is not a problem to support yourself." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The shadow will come to the old king sooner or later." Kajin suddenly said, "I have been watching Mey repeatedly in these days. I found that they all have one thing in common, that is, to subtly obscure the viewer in a fictional context, and that background is the future of the plan. Since it is the communication tool of the king's idea and will, how? Is it possible to play only in the winter? Wait until then, can you still have confidence in your own drama?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gepo stunned," We...we can also go to other places, such as the morning light. Teacher, as long as you speak, the theater over there will be willing to let us stay in--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;卡Kim shook his head. "I won't go to the morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drama The master looked up. "I want to go to the winter city again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Teacher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three were shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The troupe will take at least one month to go back and forth without winter, and during this period there is almost no income," Egpo quickly dissuaded. "We will stop, but The following newcomers and apprentices are afraid that they will not be able to make ends meet, which will affect the stability of the troupe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kakin certainly knows this, going to the field to perform, if there is a fixed foot The theater is ok, otherwise all the props and materials have to be prepared, not a relaxed life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but his meaning is not as everyone thinks, "I don't take the theater."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This time the disciples are blasphemy for a longer time, "That... what are you going to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The chance to compete for the shadows." Kim slowly said. "Although his Majesty said that the shadow will be popular sooner or later, he did not mention the specific time... ten years, or twenty years? Anyway, I can't wait that long. Even if only for five years. The Star Flower Troupe will reach an unprecedented height. It will be too late for us to catch up and then contact the Shadows from scratch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The best time to catch up with a wave is to look up and jump out of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is, there is already a Star Flower Troupe..." Benes muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Star Flower Troupe started with only two stars and two flowers." Kajin swept his disciples. "Not to mention that my thoughts have not changed." An outstanding performance must be tempered by the behind-the-scenes to achieve the best level. Since the dramas arranged by the Majesty can not be taken care of by the stars alone, then our participation is not a solution. If it can be better than Zaju The other party, maybe you can get the chance to perform in the Shadows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to play those... Zaju?" Aeggor is difficult to channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you want to get a part, you often have to give up another part." He nodded. "But even if it is a drama, it can't be a reason to relax, go all out." That's it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if I haven’t returned, or I’m not willing to leave the old king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps both have it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;卡金 is not surprised, in fact, when he came up with this idea, he was even shocked - as Aigepo said, even if It’s going to the morning sun, he can get a low status by fame, but now it’s going to be aside. It’s never an easy choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, he is old... The memory is not as good as it used to be, and his legs and feet are not flexible enough. What kind of role can he play on the stage? Generally speaking, it is not an important supporting role. Even if it is played well, it may be a joke in the eyes of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that at the moment when he became famous and turned from behind the stage to the scene, he never thought that there would be a comeback day - since he could not accept him The script, he can not write stories like "New City", "Dawn", then only try to be an actor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it incredible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kage looked at the expressions of the disciples, as if reading the thoughts in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s really incredible – after making this decision, he felt a long-lost ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am indeed old, but the strange thing is that my heart seems to be back more than 30 years ago, the first time I followed my family into the theater and saw the drama. The situation at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excitement and impulsiveness at the moment is almost exactly the same as when you were young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has countless reasons to stop himself, but in the face of the opportunity that may exist, all the reasons are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ai Gepo has followed me for the longest time and has a good understanding of the business troupe. When I am not there, he will be temporarily managed." Kajin calmly confessed, "There have been a lot of talented newcomers in the recent troupe, let them make their debut, as long as the drama is rehearsed normally, I believe there will be no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher..." The trio still wanted to say something, but he was stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed a young voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is telling him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to play the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Gray Fort West, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Roland's expectation, after finding the right materials, the speed of weaponization of napalm is amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one week, the Ministry of Chemicals put the prototype in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a dozen iron drums of 30 centimeters in diameter and about one meter high. The center of the drum is equipped with detonating explosives and connected by wires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, this is the "burning city fire of thunder" designed underneath," Lightning said with great enthusiasm. "It has three layers, each of which is special effects." Snow powder layer, combustion-support layer and fuel layer. In order to spread the combustion area more widely, these three layers are not simply wrapped structures, but like inverted mushrooms, the snow powder fire will impact the combustion and fuel layers upwards, just like the erupting volcano! And..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably it’s hard to get a chance to replace Kemer Stern, the chief alchemist of the Wangdu Alchemy Association. Inexhaustible to explain his own triumph, and his many designs have indeed made Roland's eyes shine. In addition to the ignited ignited configuration and combustion support considerations, he also first mentioned the idea of ​​delayed detonation, using electric detonators Precise and controllable characteristics enable multiple explosives to detonate in sequence, reducing mutual influence and improving killing effectiveness. It must be said that this group of people standing at the top of the industry does have different general talents.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Lightning is as passionate about the use of chemicals for manufacturing explosions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
