			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was scared to fall to the ground, or was he knocked down? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can’t tell the difference, it’s really possible to bring someone else in a panic situation. After all, everyone’s position is not scattered. luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode can’t say that it’s fortunate or lost. It’s true that the fewer competitors, the bigger the chance, but the latter test can only be singled out. Do not allow him to think more, the officer has already brought the qualified person to another compartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venue for the second test was also small, with ten seats in the middle, but the form of the chair changed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are enclosed in a circle and fixed on a large iron ring. There is a bracket under the iron ring, which seems to be free to rotate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit up in order," the examiner said with no expression. "The rules of the second round are similar to those of the previous round, and they stand firm and stick to the end. You can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one dares to say simple this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone carefully climbed the iron ring and sat down with their own number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beginning of the password, the two soldiers who were here beforehand came forward and held the handle on the back of the chair to push the ring - sure enough As Gourd expected, this thing slowly turns around with the seat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first, everyone didn't react, but as the speed increased, discomfort quickly came to mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the soldier did not stop at all, but in the command of the officer, he slammed the ring more hard, and only heard the seat in the tent. The swaying snoring, the vision in the eyes of Goode is becoming more and more blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the only remaining feeling in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of the first illusion has not fully recovered, at this time the strong dizziness caused his stomach to tumbling up and down, sour water almost rushed to the base of the tongue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this assessment? Are the troops recruiting monsters? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gritted his teeth and tried to look at the soldiers who plucked the iron ring, only to find that they deliberately looked at the roof and tried to avoid direct viewing with the iron ring. It's just that the hands are repeating simple movements and are not affected by the rotation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...this is not fair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shouted in his heart. And the man only said that he insisted on the end, but did not say the specific time - in case he had to turn half an hour, he was afraid to faint in the chair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act of focusing on the line of sight exacerbated the dizziness in the brain, and Gourde could no longer hold the sour water in his stomach, and the mouth directly sprayed it out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vo~————!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sour smell suddenly rushed into nostril. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the serial reaction, his spit directly let other people spit out, the taste in the tent became very horrible, and even a little Splash of residual juice and half-digestion stuck to his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I can't!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop... Stop! Vomiting- Can't hold it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode finally knows why he heard vomiting outside the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too difficult for people to be too strong, and more importantly, what is the significance of this assessment? Is this really an recruitment of the army, rather than deliberately teasing their play? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every interest has been so difficult, he feels that he may give up at any time, but until the end of the iron ring, he did not loosen the seat back Hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a rare color of approval on the officer's face. "It's done very well. You are one step closer to passing the qualification! Take a break for five minutes. From the third round of assessment, the difficulty will gradually decrease. Just take it seriously." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now no one will believe the other person’s words, everyone is on the verge of enemies, smearing their faces with their sleeves, sinking their faces into the next compartment between. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this time, Goode found that the officer did not lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third test is to drill into a hollow ring, and use your hands and feet to roll it from one end of the tent to the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth test is to flip through a set of weird pictures - painted with similarly colored patches, pointing out the animal patterns hidden in them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is all passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the doubts in Goode’s heart are getting stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth test is a full-body examination of the stripped garment, and the sixth test is to indicate the orientation of the arrow on a piece of luminescent glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although everyone’s performance is different, the results are still qualified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he waited for the next test, the officer took the three out of the tent, and Gunder discovered that the back door of the big camp was still erected. Another small account, the black guards surrounded the area, it seems that there are important people in the general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, we are..." Someone couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer raised his mouth. "Forgot to congratulate you, the assessment has all ended. You have passed the preliminary screening. Wait here, then there will be people." "Entertain you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this just an initial screening? The treatment on the announcement--" Goode shut his mouth when he halfway through it. When it is over, the army will certainly not welcome people who come only for treatment, just as the Cavaliers always put honors on their lips. So hurriedly said, in the eyes of the other party, I was afraid to become a greedy generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the officer did not reveal any disappointment, but looked at him seriously. "Do you need money?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is nothing, after all, the first military treatment is high, the whole winter city knows, actually I also joined the army because of this original intention.” The other side shrugged. “The answer is yes. The education subsidies, living allowances, and salary amount written on the announcement will be truthfully distributed. The follow-up screening will determine that you can Which step to take, not an excuse to deduct your reward, as I said before, if you really want to be a member of the army, you still have a lot to learn."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodton felt surrounded by a great happiness - he... was chosen? More than the salary of Uncle Bagh, enough to feed him and Rachel's subsidy, have become a reality? In an instant, the bitterness in the tent was nothing, and in retrospect, it even brought a touch of sweetness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, thank you adults--!" He was so excited that he continued to join the first army! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two are also excited, learning to look like he bent down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I still want to tell you that there are indeed many people who come to the army with high-paying ideas, but what they really stay is not Salary.” The officer smiled in disapproval. “There are more things to pursue here. When you find out, the initial thoughts are not worth mentioning.” He’s like a slight reminder. What is worth remembering, "Well, there are still many people waiting for the assessment, and there will be opportunities to talk later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is not indifferent Ruthless person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode couldn’t help but move, "Adult, since we have passed the assessment, can we tell us your name now?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
