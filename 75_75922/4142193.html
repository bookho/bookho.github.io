			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is abrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of such a sharp turn made the dragon and the Fijian language stunned, but the old martial arts family turned the front for the first time, and joined forces to stop the rushing up. Demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, find a way to kill!" A middle-aged man hurriedly said, "We must not be surrounded!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two containers are also turbulent, and the internal sounds are constantly coming, and the wrapped iron sheets appear one piece after another. It is obviously not supported by a fixed bar lock for too long. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are dozens of people in these two boxes, then don’t say that they are annihilating each other, and even fleeing is a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing now is to avoid being attacked by the front and back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing the cold quickly reacted, and she turned to kill the factory door - as long as it can rush into the open area, the retreat will at least not destroy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly the most correct breakout route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland still chose the back of the temple, but compared to the beginning of the relaxed, now he has gathered all the spirit to deal with the new slayers like the zombies By. Even if the other party can't play the proper level in front of him, it will still be hurt if he is taken a bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a team, we are in danger, the number of enemies far exceeds expectations, request support!" The captain shouted for help while fighting back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In just a few minutes, two more people were thrown down, and the white light that protects the body just flashed twice, and the madman’s crazy bite The next quarter is split. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the blood and minced meat splashed by the companion, the dragon’s skill is obviously slower than two shots, even Roland’s layman notices that his The boxing foot was not as flexible as before, and the offensive and defensive transition also revealed a gap. After knocking down a few demonists, his body first appeared scratches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boom-!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The container door is finally overwhelmed, the arrogant demon Knocked open and slammed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the enemies that rushed out were not as much as expected. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland brows slightly pick, only to see the ten-dead scorpion on the steel pipe, although they have completed the transformation, but did not break free The rope, the big hole in the body is still lying on the blood, as if the moment of infection was pierced by something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodies that lined up in a row looked toward the wall of the box, and the few light-transparent holes on the top were clearly distinguishable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being beautiful, he couldn’t help but praise him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that it is Felice’s moving hand – he can even imagine that Felice is quietly under the cover of Yan’s. Moved to the back of the box and, after finding something wrong, put the blade into the box the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...what is going on?" The enemy’s head was angry. "You damn thieves, what have you done to my children!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrian naturally has no time to take care of it, although everyone’s doubts are not much less than it, but now it is not at all concerned about this time. Without the pressure of one enemy and ten, the possibility of killing a living path is much higher. At one time, the team's momentum has revived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But," it slammed. "My plan won't be blocked by this little episode. You will all die here!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After it was finished, it took out a square box with a remote control from the pocket and pressed the button above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a few loud noises, the corners of the factory exploded in an instant, and the whole ground actually broke into several pieces and collapsed down! The burning torch was also smashed by the air, and the surrounding vision suddenly became dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty!" On the occasion of this millennium, a slender little hand reached out and grabbed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two swaying, he felt himself hugged, and after a series of bumps, he finally landed on a flat land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cough... Spirit?" He fanned the dust in front of the fan and asked for a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am, are you okay?" The latter immediately responded. "Fortunately, the explosion just made the fire disappear and I found the opportunity to catch you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, after the torch was blown up, the factory covered by the night became a spiritual realm - when she moved in the shadows, she could almost reach the fog of the nightingale. Walk through the same effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have nothing, other witches are okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured, there is Felice At this level of collapse will never hurt the grace. And Falcon has been staying outside the factory to monitor the situation and has not followed up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's all right," Roland pulled down the night vision on his head and looked at the environment around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, this thing like a multi-eyed demon is..." asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The low-light night vision device allows ordinary people to see things clearly at night," he explained. "So even if it is a place where you can’t reach your fingers, you Also pay attention to hiding whereabouts and be careful to be seen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...咕噜噜..." The spirit sneaked into the shadows, leaving only half of the head On the outside, a few bubbles appeared in front of the nose, as if it were really water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the faint moonlight sprinkled overhead, he quickly identified the current situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collapse allowed everyone to spread out. The site was full of concrete slabs, and it was impossible to determine the location of other teammates. However, considering that martial arts can use natural forces to resist conventional injuries, this level of collapse does not require their lives. The same enemy should also be aware of this. Since it is such a hand, it will definitely not just want to trap them here - as long as it is delayed for a while, the support of the second team will arrive, and the sacrifice plan of the demon head will be inevitable. Will go bankrupt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doubt is on this pit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C02 When explaining the route, there is no mention of a basement below the meeting place. From the map, the factory should also be built on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the depths of the mud walls, this is clearly not part of the design. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the hollowing out of the factory floor and placing explosives sufficient to blow up the floor is a deliberate attempt by the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland noticed that the whole pit was flat, but it collapsed at the center, just like a huge whirlpool. Most of the bodies of the demons who fell down slipped into the vortex and stacked on top of each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it... is this part of the sacrifice ceremony? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His doubts did not last long - the leader appeared again in his vision, under the command of the "housekeeper", still alive Instead of going around to search for the martial arts house, they held the core cyclones and similar bodies that had not fallen into the pit, and jumped into the center of the potholes one by one. Not only that, they did not put the dead bodies of the dead martial arts. Over. In the blink of an eye, the bottom of the small pit has a tendency to be filled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s heart jerked, and the heat in the body suddenly became active, as if he had felt something called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God... please receive my final gift!" The butler opened his hands and fell face to the pit-<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All cores burst out with dazzling light at the same time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
