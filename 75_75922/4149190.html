			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is your injury recovering?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finanese language holds a big bang The book went into the ward 402 and piled the books on the flat-top cabinet at the bedside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Wakiris nodded and said, "I have been able to get out of bed. The doctor said that it will be restored in about a week." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good. Even in the martial arts home, your self-healing ability is considered top-notch." Fiji smiled coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of nature strengthens the body Different, not every awakened person can be like you, the bones of the legs can still heal in a month after being crushed. However, you may not have seen the martial arts family suffer such a serious injury before, do not know their own "The potential is there." She paused. "You are in your presence, strength should be in the forefront?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you think?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My master often said that the strong is often strong in every respect - healing means that your roots are of excellent quality and your body is resistant to attack, and such people The martial arts talent is generally one of the best, just like me." Fiji said calmly, "After your injury is all right, maybe we can learn a few more."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is why you pulled me into the squad?" Wajilis reluctantly said, "You are the super genius of the association. I don't think I can be in martial arts." What can you help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter, let's say that you have been lying in the hospital bed for so long, and you can quickly find the strength with the powerful people. After all, after all, The demon will not worry that you have been injured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Wakiris nodded after a moment of silence, "When is the time?" "Teach more advice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Fiji swelled his lips. "Yes, I went to the city center yesterday and bought some The specialty cakes on the Kajid Peninsula are placed in the bag at the top of the book. You should be interested - after all, the three meals served in the hospital are too monotonous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to this, she catches a subtle surge in the other's throat - it's an unobtrusive swallowing action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the Kajiad family can also eat ordinary food, it is said that it is difficult to distinguish the taste, only the unique ingredients produced by the place where they originated. Satisfy its taste. Fiji Han has also tried this kind of “feeling unique” food and found it completely unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are a small number of people who claim that they can appreciate the rareness of the world as long as they taste it, but this view has not been recognized by the public. Therefore, the food from Kajiad is only sold in some exclusive stores - the peninsula is always a very small number compared to the vast majority of the city's residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s hard to worry about it..." Wajilis well covered up his subconscious reaction, thanking again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s nothing, I’m a captain, and it’s just a matter of concern for the players.” Fiji swayed, "But then, you still I really like reading books."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, if you are bored, you want to find something to turn over and you get used to it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a good habit. There isn't any other entertainment in the sanatorium. There are quite a lot of books. If you want to see something, tell me directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, the two did not answer any more, and only the rustling page was left in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing cold standing by the window of the ward, overlooking the scenery outside the window - today's weather is very good, it is considered to be autumn, the yellowed wicker next to the artificial lake Into the water, along the Xuan soft wind to draw a wave of waves; further a line of swan is not slow to swim across the lake, leaving a string of white waves in the blue reflection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, her afterglow has never left Wajiris, and through the reflection on the glass window, Fiji has always looked at each other's every move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is neither a warm-hearted person nor interested in forcing others to compete with herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this appearance is because she was unexpectedly aware of the visit to the meeting a month ago, and this person may know Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the correct statement should be that she knows Roland, and Roland treats her as another person - those seemingly light-handed conversations are essentially He is confirming his own judgment. For this, Fiji Han thinks that he will not be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what puzzles her is that Roland did not show any hostility when asked, and the tone was quite easy, that is, regardless of Wakiri Silk is not a threat to anyone who is familiar with him. But the latter showed strong hostility and tension - although it only happened at the moment when everyone entered the door, it was still caught in the forefront of Fiji. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of relationship will produce such a reaction difference? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the dog is a little bloody, it is not difficult to conceive a lover’s drama because of love, revenge for ten years, repentance of the former, and can’t afford it. But the Fijian language has no thoughts on that aspect. The reason is that Vakiris's subsequent control of the expression is too amazing. If there is no scene at the beginning, it is difficult for her to find out the clues. If it is only an emotional issue, it is hard to believe that someone can do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing language is very good at observing since childhood, and the power of nature has risen to a new level, and because of this, people who are really familiar with her are one by one. They have alienated her and even feared to get along with her. For a long time, she has become accustomed to this sense of alienation, and gradually opened the distance with everyone - anyway, only need to look a little far away, she can guess the thoughts of the other party's heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland is different, the new hunter of this association is a rare person in recent years, two or three eyes can not see through, and Roland exists The same is true of the relationship of Wakiri. They are obviously hiding something, and the secret behind it makes it difficult for her to pay attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the next time with Wakiris, Fiji Han further confirmed his instincts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This martial artist from the Kajid Peninsula is no different from ordinary people, but there are still many details in life that reveal the same - if she is Before the other person I met before Roland, I wouldn't be suspicious, but when she made a little association, these strange things could be connected in an amazing way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, she had previously given a waffle to the Wakiri ribbon. The latter did not show any joy at first, but later found that the other It is eaten clean. This time, the reaction of Wakiris has changed significantly. At first glance, it seems that there is no big problem, but if you think about it, you will find that it means that the other person does not eat to fill his stomach, but he does not know the taste of his home snacks before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person from the Kajid Peninsula did not eat Kajiad’s specialties, which simply does not make sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this month, Fiji has never seen Wakiris playing the phone - now the young man can’t live without it for a moment, the other It's like being insulated, it's a bit embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are those books...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of Wakiris, she is from the library All borrowed are historical books. Although it is a good habit to love reading, but reading a boring and tasteless history book for a whole day, this patience and perseverance is not as good as it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the change in attitude towards food is because there is no appetite at first, don’t play mobile because it’s quiet, just look at history because it’s special, it seems to explain through. But it’s too coincidental that all the same things happen together. Compared to all of the above reasons, there is always a feeling that the other side is quickly becoming familiar with the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s in peacetime, she’s probably only smiled, but when she thinks of the phrase “陛下”, she suddenly has an incredible heart. Guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
