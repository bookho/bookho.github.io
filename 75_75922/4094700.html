			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the tenth day of the expedition, on the Chishui River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stood in the bow of the shallow water heavy artillery, looking at the sparkling river in front of him, feeling very heroic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is behind a huge fleet, although there have been some heads turned to the east in three days, but there are ten steamer boats left. It is still a rare sight on the river. The chimneys standing like iron forests were painted in striking snow white, and the black smoke ejected a "black cloud" above the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the central part of the Grey Fort, the number of vessels is significantly less, which means that the Kingdomâ€™s trade center is moving towards the west. However, the influence of several major cities in the central region is still there. Compared with the numerous single-deck boats in the west, the sailing boats here are mostly beautiful and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, the merchant ships that met along the way were all avoiding the side, and the bold sailors would kneel on the side of the ship and be amazed at the flagship of steel casting. The captain or merchant who recognizes the meaning of the tower's long gun flag will lower his head and pay tribute to the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In three years, he was able to find such a family. Roland was very satisfied, but what made him even more gratified was the young officials trained by the City Hall. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have not traced the ancestry of a hundred years, nor have they been rich and prosperous. They only accepted short-term universal education and mastered the reading and writing of words. If it is put in the past, at best, only some nobles and chores will be done under the aristocrats, but in the absence of the winter city, they gradually become the backbone of various departments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the lack of backing, a new generation of officials will fully support Roland - no one but him will be the one who will be so disregarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they have never held a management position, they will be careful to follow the rules. If they encounter any problems, they will bother to ask for superiors, and they will not be infected with nobles. Exaggerated, conceited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the selection from the ordinary people, they are doing their own thing, the Ministry of Agriculture officials lead farmers to grow wheat, and the Ministry of Construction officials demonstrate the characteristics of cement to new workers. This is a common sight in the absence of winter city. A powerful centralized government must have strong control over the grassroots to achieve its fast and efficient potential, which just satisfies this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the rise of the civilian class as a manager is not without flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like a poor person who has never had a family property suddenly gets a fortune, it is easy to fall into the trap of greed and short-sightedness. According to the education level of no winter city, not to mention personal qualities and professional qualities. Fortunately, there are nightingales around Roland. The internal review of the Security Bureau can effectively curb this tendency. After several screenings and severe punishments, those who remain in the City Hall have basically understood the bottom line of His Majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing number of young officials today has become a guarantee for Roland to expand his power. It can even be said that his plan to regain the kingdom is based on the number of available officials. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, he has finally unified the foundation of the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notify the staff that they all went to the upper observation room to meet," Roland said, turning to the nightingale. "How to take over Chishui City, they should also come up with a plan." Come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the fleet without Wintertown is not the first Once in a trip to Chishui City, the first army had visited this central city as early as six months ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the plan given by the staff is also well-founded: "Your Majesty, Chishui is the second-largest city in the central region, not only the territory under its jurisdiction. There are also a lot of nobles. I am afraid I can't force the lord to hand over the power like Liu Yezhen a week ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn dawn Sir Sirte further elaborated, "The Count of Delta, the governor of Chishui City, is not an ambitious person. This can be seen from the taxation of the city. - Sitting in the crossroads of the river, he can ask for more. The Delta family has been operating here for generations, and even if it gives up its power to seal the land, it will not fall there. Compared with the matter of reversing the life, the Earl should make a wise choice."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
