			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the snake's teeth didn't expect it, and the more unbelievable thing was still behind - the speaker's next message made him unable to move his feet anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Five days later, the second week of the first month of spring, the City Hall will distribute relief rations in the square! Everyone can get two hot meals here. Teng Teng's wheat porridge, one in the evening of noon, the city people, thank you for the kindness of His Royal Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a stir in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, Gore didn't lie, there is such a thing in the announcement!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yeah, I just want to confirm it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't get it wrong? Everyday there is porridge?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You come too? Isn't there a lot of wheat and dried meat in your home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's two free. , the guardian of the adults did not allow me to lead, you did not listen to what people say, everyone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult!" Suddenly someone asked loudly "Does the porridge really free? When will it be sent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a concern of most people, and everyone stopped talking. , looking at the nobles and attending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter waited until the expectations of the crowds reached the apex, and they rushed out loudly. "Yes! Mai porridge is really free, and will Continue until the end of the Demon Moon! Tell the more neighbors and friends about this news, and the promise made by His Royal Highness will be realized!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hundreds of people boiled in an instant, but the snakes still couldn't believe their ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free to eat, what does this mean? They can temporarily get rid of the threat of Kanash, no longer have to worry about starving in the cold snow - not right, not just them, all mice can easily get food, so that the king and belly can not control the bottom The tail is up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanas will never sit back and watch this happen, what will he do? Send people to disperse the crowd, stir up the porridge scene... Or buy the city hall officials, pour the porridge into the Chishui River? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Snake also noticed that the "Prince of the Prince" mentioned by the speaker three times and five times, that is, the request for relief rations is the legend. The four princes, not the former Duke or the five major families. Will he let these rat kings feel guilty, or is it really different from other nobles? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didnâ€™t want to trust any nobles, and the scene in which white paper was cheated was still vivid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another voice in my heart that keeps asking myself, in case it is true, in case... is it true? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this doubt has not lasted for too long, because the elk attendant on the stage has begun to preach the next message - he thought that these decrees were just the thought of the masters. The new tricks of tossing the city people are irrelevant to the vagrant children who have no place to live. As a result, the first two news made him extremely unexpected, and the third news is directed at the mouse group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"City of the people, listen, your good days are coming!" The speaker first stabilized the noisy crowd with one sentence, then one The word said, "Five days later, from the day of the porridge, His Royal Highness will launch a crackdown on crimes in the Long Song Fortress, including the removal of the Black Street organization, the fight against theft, and all threats to the lives and property of the city. The wrongdoing! At that time, everyone should not stay in Black Street, and do not go to pubs, casinos and other mixed places to avoid unnecessary harm!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortress The order needs to be maintained by all the city people. Now the City Hall is recruiting staff, including security personnel and police officers. I will explain the recruitment requirements in detail below!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The snake tooth has no more thoughts to listen to, and he drilled out of the crowd and ran to the bonfire. "Come, let's go back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen "Is it finished?" Kwai took his hands and reluctantly said, "You also bake hot and go. . "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
