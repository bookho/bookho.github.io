			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram’s favorite thing to do is to sit on the second floor of the pub and admire the customers who are downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his pub and his territory, so Thuram named it "Skull Glass" according to his own preferences and re-decorated it. Fan also hangs a series of incomplete skulls at the entrance as a sign of the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it was not called this name five years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it called at that time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairy Forest...or Fairy Garden? Regarding him, it is no longer important anyway. Thuram drank a strong spirit of fire lantern fruit, so that the hot taste filled the tongue. Such a weak name is not suitable for bloody places. There is no such thing as a goblin or a goblin-like woman. How much bones are there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After each battle, a pile of corpses will be left on the outer side of Tiesha City. He prefers to be buried in hot sand than the perishable flesh. The white bones, especially the skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, it has a threatening effect, so that those who come to drink and trouble to make trouble understand what is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it really can hold wine so that you can buy fewer glasses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the former is not effective for everyone, there is always a part of the head that is born with a deformed idiot that thinks that all places are in his own backyard, and his opponents are A woman who only cries and cries is no different. In a place where troublemakers often appear, fragile pottery and glass are not ideal containers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every customer is a habit that Thuram has developed in recent years. People who come and go here can generally be divided into three categories, half dead, dead and dead. - He prefers to distinguish people like this. The purpose of the semi-dead is very simple, drinking, gambling, and playing with women; as long as they maintain their current state of affairs, they can basically walk the remaining half. Most of the deceased are watchdogs, or challengers who are inquiring about the situation. They have placed their heads under the sword and are likely to move at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the deceased... Of course, those who are troublemakers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram’s focus is not on the half-dead or the dead, because the former is very boring, and the latter is only brought to death. So a little joy. What he likes most is to see the dead. On them, Thuram can see himself as a young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, he also like them, holding a sharp knife in his hand, in the bloody land envied by many clan, his eyes have been looking at Tiesha City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting, courage, blood, and strength go away from him a little, until someone replaces his position and becomes the new owner of the small oasis... Only then let yourself survive and become part of the blood-stained land, but from the dead to the half-dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although putting life under the blade, the deceased may fly to the sky, such as breaking the wings and reviving the fire. The half-dead will never have this opportunity, and can only find some fun in the second half of boring as a comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, enjoy these oasis passers-by... or bury yourself in the yellow sand or become the new owner of the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a man pushed the door and came in, whispering a few words in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Are you sure you have not heard it wrong?" Thuram groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said so, and from the appearance of the woman around him...it is probably a goddess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram indulged for a moment, then revealed a smug smile, "Take them in, remember to take off the weapon, this guy is not too good to deal with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, now there is a big fun to come to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
