			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, are you going to send troops to the south?" The iron axe has always had a rare excitement. "The evil moon is coming soon." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think there are no people left in Wintertown to cope with the sinister beasts?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." He took a deep breath and forced the expression of excitement to be suppressed. "If you look at the scale of the previous year, a thousand people will be able to hold the wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, for the sake of conservatism, it would be more than enough to leave 2,500 soldiers, not to mention the fact that a new batch of reserve forces has begun to recruit, and there is no problem in defending the winter city." Roland Standing up and walking to the floor-to-ceiling window, "I talked about the extreme south, you should be the one who is most familiar with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, kneel down "The iron axe has a military ceremony." Most of the land in the southern part of the country is yellow sand. The oasis is scattered along the Yinchuan to the west of the desert. More than 90% of the Mojin people are born. Among these oases, there is a city on the largest oasis, and it is also the only city in the extreme south, Tiesha City.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yinchuan is a river ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can only count half a river," Iron Axe explained. "Most of the time, it is buried in the ground, just like the underground river." The exposed parts of the ground form an oasis, so the Mokins also called it the river of life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland turned and curious, "It Where does it originate? I see from the map that there are no mountains or lakes nearby.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s from the sea, the gift of Poseidon,” The axe went to the table and pointed to the junction of the west side of the extreme south and the green space. "There is a huge cave in it. The flowing water is constantly pouring into the hole. Standing on it, you can feel the tremor of the soles of the feet." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, seawater is the source of Yinchuan? But it is clearly able to nurture oasis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;&nbsp;It can be an oasis, which means that Yinchuan is a freshwater river. The salt in the sea is too high to be used for irrigation and drinking. This sounds totally unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mother of the earth absorbed the salt in the sea, and all the areas were covered with white salt, which also isolated the green space of the gray fort. When salting, just mention a bucket and go to the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a magical work of nature? The soil under the yellow sand actually filtered the salt and formed a saline-alkali land? Roland is amazed. It seems that in addition to oil, he has added another resource that needs to be collected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people live in Iron Sands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"40,000 or so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many more than the old king of the Grey Fort?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Mausoleum, the city of Shamin and The kingdom capital is not the same," the iron axe smiled. "Tiesha City has only one core city, which is occupied by the six clan powers. The outer periphery is basically a tent or a thatched cottage. The floor is expanded and gradually formed today. Look - as long as you enter the oasis, you will enter the Iron Sands City territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Mojin people living in other oases? The number should also be A lot?" Roland asked. The population is the key to the ability to quickly convert local specialty products into usable resources. It is unlikely that a large number of people will be deployed from the winter city to exploit oil. In the end, local people must be used to work for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief commander nodded, "Nobody counted, but I estimate there are at least 100,000 people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The establishment of several mining stations and a transportation line should be enough. The next question is how to control them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what happened to the sacred duel you said last time? How did Mo Jinren determine the rule?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the answer of the iron axe was very detailed, almost for half an hour, Roland only figured out the way the sand people competed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
