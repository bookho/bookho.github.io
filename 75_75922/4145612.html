			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barov was called from his servant by his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the period of the Red Moon, he not only arranged personnel in the Executive Office to stay in the night, but also in the mansion - in the event of any failure to respond to the plan In the case of an emergency, he asked his men to inform themselves the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis has been transferred from the Executive Office, but his influence on His Majesty has not diminished. Now even his department is working on the plan. I would like to ask the opinions of the General Staff Department first. In the face of such a talented opponent, he did not dare to relax his request for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the whole reason why he is diligent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the boss even has some feeling of enjoying this kind of busyness, busy means power, which shows that the winter is inseparable from his existence. At the same time, he can still accumulate the trust of His Majesty, and the happiness of his double life makes him happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baloff turned from the bed and asked while changing clothes. "Let's say, what happened?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult is the command of His Majesty the King. He asks you to immediately convene all ministers and go to the Castle Chamber to discuss matters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Now?" Barov looked at the window with amazement, and there was no doubt that it was late at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the people on the phone didn't say much, do you want to send someone to the castle to ask..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," the boss quickly made a judgment, and it was impossible to get it from the Executive Office to his home. Since the phone is still not popular, so only one person’s residence is equipped with this stuff. Others must give a verbal notice. “Call the people in the house and call the door in batches. The heads of all departments must inform Come, miss one, I only ask you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the past four princes, he will hesitate, but now Roland is already one An impeccable king, if he decides to meet in the early hours of the morning, then he must have encountered something that is extremely important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes...yes, adults," the servant responded quickly. "Are you going to go to the castle alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I will go with the North Pearl." Barov replied, "Itis Kant is personally notified by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, everyone is almost there." The nightingale put on a coat for Roland. "I need to help you make a cup of tea." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trouble you," he nodded. "I didn't sleep long before I called you again..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is nothing," said the nightingale. "Under my mind, my spirit is good. The previous yawns are actually pretending."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"呃...装?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no," she suddenly seemed to have something, and quickly changed her mind, "I mean Although I yawned a few times, it was only because the eyes were a bit dry, not sleepy. That's right. You don't want to call Anna together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let her sleep well," Roland shook his head. "This kind of thing." She doesn't need her to worry about it for a while, and... she is too tired this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the Rubik's cube engine a reliable new generation power source, Anna was soaked in the North Slope Lab from morning till night, and the mass production of the biplane was imminent, and the pressure could be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are the same.” The nightingale handed the strong tea to him. “When I entered the dream world, wasn’t it a break?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, I am quite talented in staying up late..." Roland smiled, and irregular work schedules were just commonplace for his time. This level of tiredness is far from the limit. Just pay attention to make up for sleep in time. "If you don't explain things, you can't sleep even if you are lying in bed."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
