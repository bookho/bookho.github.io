Stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he closed his eyes, he could find this position again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Record, between the three districts of the early summer, between the six stars and the blazing stars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes," he groped his own, and then drew a circle at the corresponding position, which meant that there was another star on the astrological map. "What about the name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Not available for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher?"陨Slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As I said, don't remember the name first." The diffuse star repeated, "In addition, the bachelors on the current star-studded stage are called together, then Let the apprentice leave... immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His last voice is almost low. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will do it right away," he was shocked and then ran to other astrologers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the gods of heaven bless us and let the stars think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, all the bachelors gathered around the chief astrologer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his serious look, what everyone seems to be aware of - since Roland visited the astrological association, the rumors of the catastrophic star are between astrologers No longer a secret. The young king even suggested that the chief handed the gold piece of the ancestor to all the bachelors to see, one is to improve their purpose in star-gazing, and the other is to give them responsibility and glory. I don't know if it is an illusion. The diffuse star always felt that some of the tone of the last day was not taken for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chief, don't you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded, "I found one Red stars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes everyone breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I don't know if it's a spot, or an illusion..." The diffuse star swayed. "This phenomenon is very common in stargazing, so... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we need to review it." The Nether Star takes over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," he nodded. "Start with you first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, all eight astrologers watched it again - in order to eliminate the instrument problem, they also changed the telescope twice and an old stargazing star instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the fact that the latter could not observe the red star, no matter which telescope was used, everyone clearly saw the dim star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person may be dazzled or have an illusion, but it is impossible for eight people to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most eye-catching Bachelor of Stars, also claimed to have seen the outline of the star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of "Red Star" has been confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The astrology then fell into a strange silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diffuse Stars don’t know if this is the blessing or punishment of the gods. From joining the association, all efforts are for this day, in order to find this show, the misfortune The star of the disaster. But when he really found it, there was a sudden fear in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Predicting the end of the day will be a heavy responsibility for the astrologers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should we do?" It took a long time for someone to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Accordingly, the matter should be reported to the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean Roland. Wimbledon? Will he believe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will not disappear even if he does not believe in the stars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I mean he may not believe the prophecy about the Star of the World."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A good try, after all, these instruments are still He gave it to the astrology, and it was impossible to sneer at our words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who knows, he was notoriously stubborn in Wangdu." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he is stubborn, he will not leave us in the first place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Enough," the diffuse star raised his hand and interrupted the discussion. "The news of the red star is not disclosed for the time being. We will observe it for a few more days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He looked around every bachelor around him, "I know that it exists far." Far from enough, I need to understand the trajectory of its operation, the speed of travel, and how long it may come to the world. The more clues we collect, the more convincing our predictions are, understand?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wish, Chief Adult." Everyone squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week of observation, the diffuse star feels that the star is becoming more and more incredible . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It won’t move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All stars are moving, they sometimes appear on the horizon, and then slowly rise to mid-air, and some will disappear after midnight. Change shows regularity, otherwise there is no track to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Star of the World has no signs of moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven-day time makes the six-star star slightly tilted a little - when the fall comes, it will gradually change from six horizontal lines to six vertical lines, so that the red star Mang is moving away from the center of the two constellations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this contrast that the diffuse star is shocked that it has not changed, as if it were not a star, but a fixed background under the night . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it doesn’t move, it’s impossible to get close to the four kingdoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the prophecy shows, the Star of the World must be born—that is, anyone can observe it directly with the naked eye, and the disaster will come. If the content engraved on the gold film is correct, does this mean that the end of the disaster will never come? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that its light is changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conclusion comes from the Bachelor of Stars in Rose, and her records show that the stars are getting brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, when she mentioned this matter alone, the diffuse star was not concerned. After all, the stars are very stable things, unlike the moon, they change shape and luster. But on the seventh day, the Bachelor of Science, who returned from illness, also put forward the same view. Plus, they are the two best astrologers in the association, which has to be taken seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After convening the discussion of the crowd that night, the female singer’s whimsy made people in the place shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the world is meant to let the people of the kingdom see it, is there such a possibility? Even if the star of the world is not moving, The brighter and brighter light will eventually make it surpass the Venus and become a torch that is hung in the air, so that everyone can see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is like thunder It blew in the heart of the diffuse star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
