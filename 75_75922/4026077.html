			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After arresting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, a shot in the leg, Although it stopped the blood, it is estimated that there is no way to walk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is anyone else okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"There is also a bloody witch who is called Tianyan, who died that night." Tilly sighed. "Our people are not hurt."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded. "I will let Nanava cure her, and the rest will go back to the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......< Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church is about to invade the Grey Fort is the top priority compared to the leader of the bloody meeting. When he returned to the office, he first asked about the situation of the sleeping island, and then handed the letter from the north to Tilly and others to watch. Ashes and Andrea were left behind because of the three families involved in the morning king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since receiving the warning letter, Roland has contacted the spokesperson Hill Fox of Glow City twice, and finally got a general understanding of the matter. When he talked about the full information, Andrea could not help but shook his head. "Otto, this idiot, looks like a child. If you don't marry Oro, he would never dare to enter the palace alone."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least he let us know the movement of the church in advance," Ashes shrugged. "And there is a big part of the incentive because of you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you responded to him?" Tilly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I advised him not to act rashly. If the witch can really ignore the stone of punishment, it is difficult for ordinary people to restrain her, let alone Prince Anpein. Also talked about "the god of warriors." Roland poured a cup of tea for everyone. "The grey fort and the morning light are too far away. I can't give him direct help, so hide the secret for a while, and wait until the church concentrates all the attention on the gray fort. Wise choice. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He may not be able to hold it," Andrea frowned. "Otto Rossi was very impulsive from an early age." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will listen, because I have said one more," Roland said with a smile. "You are safe in me, even if you are fighting the church." The enemy can't hurt you too much, but if he dies, he will never see you again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a very effective persuasion," Ashes whistled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok," Tilly screamed to stop the upcoming quarrel. By the way, she also glared at Roland. It seemed that she was blaming him for not saying this thing to tease each other. "How do you plan to deal with the church's offense?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough... Use a musket and a cannon to build a line of defense under the windy ridge." He took out the map from the drawer and said, pointing to the North Line. "After receiving the information, I have already let the First Army send the war preparations to the Valley Town, and at the same time clean the church forces in the Kingdom." In this way, the holy city of Hermes is bound to detect the movement of the gray fort, and now I intend to enter the cold wind ridge. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deliberately let the enemy know your actions? "Andreia asked inexplicably. "Excuse me, in general, this kind of intentional leaking news is not all fake?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only, I don't have to guess where they will invade the Grey Fort, and the people will suffer less," Roland explained his plan. Once again, "the positive confrontation of the enemy is the best way the first army is good at combat. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that," Tilly nodded. "It's really a simple and effective way." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there is a hidden danger, that is pure," he continued. "In front of the fire net, any enemy that can be seen is not terrible." The church witch, whose ability is completely unknown, may bring unpredictable troubles to the First Army. The best thing to guard against them, I think there are only witches who can also sense the magic. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also the purpose of our trip," Tilly responded. "Don't worry, my brother, the Sleeping Island Witch will work side by side with you." ‚Äù<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
