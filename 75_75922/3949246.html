			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Preparation-!stab!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna pricked the pistol in his hand, then Both hands shook and the guns squeaked. A wolf is on top of the gun, its hair is fluffy, its bloody eyes are like a bell, and two rows of fangs are exposed in the open mouth. The biggest one is worthy of your thumb. For the first time, he was so close to the evil beast that the other side waved his claws in the air, and the snow even splashed on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna has a blank in his mind, almost instinctively accumulating in training, subconsciously clenching the gun and continuing to move forward. The moment of rest seemed to be extremely long. He saw the guns bent to the limit, and the tip of the gun was deeply immersed in the belly of the evil beast. He even thought that the next moment, the sharp claws would tear open his cheeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "啪", the gun can not withstand the momentum of the wolf, and finally broke into two. It was this sound that made the time flow return to normal, and the other side fell down, as it came when it - its claws fell on the retaining wall, scraping a series of debris, carrying the half of the gun, along the wall Heavy fallen to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Firearms, filling up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free shooting!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Fannah immediately extended two barrels, he quickly stepped back and raised his head to avoid gunpowder debris and gas rushing into his eyes. As for the ears, he can't take care of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The musket was fired very quickly, and Fanner regained the wall and found a variety of evil beasts at the bottom of the wall. Someone around him licked himself, and he turned his head and saw that his roommate was smugly pouting at himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I touched the gun for more than a week, what is good? Fanna looked back and moved his eyes back to the battlefield. When the artillery team of His Royal Highness comes in handy, you will realize that the iron pipe in your hand is nothing but a crutches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, your gun, then." The cat claw passed a new wooden gun. "This group of evil beasts is crazy? There are already two or three "Time is up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are mad by themselves," Fanner put the gun on, waiting for the enemy to attack the next wave. "When is it now?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s almost midday." The cat’s claws sighed, and the hunter didn’t pay attention. He quickly looked at both sides. “Pomelo? Rodney Brothers?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t look away, do you want to be smashed by the wolf?” Fanner said with a sigh of relief, “They were assigned to other The wall section, maybe in three groups, maybe in the four groups, then, how come you come to the first group?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the substitute team," He smiled. "Where is there, I will come where I am. Just an uncle was injured, it happened to be my turn--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Preparation- "The voice of the Orion Observer Since, cat's claw, then interrupted. Vanner saw that the evil beasts were approaching quickly, and now he can quickly distinguish the types of evil beasts. This wave has only two wolves, the other are wild boar species, fox species and a bear species. The threat is not big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stab!" Still, he still obeyed the instructions and unified his rifle with his teammates. Sure enough, this time the gun was empty, he took back the gun, and Yu Guang saw that the wolf had been shot down by a group of other players. When other evil beasts that ran slower also gathered under the city, the fire brigade squeezed into his side and shot freely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repetition of such fixed actions has continued from dawn to the present. When the initial horn was blown, most people were still asleep. Fanna yawned, this time the attack of the evil beast is more intense than before. Usually only one or two waves of attack will continue, and the corpse of the evil beast under the wall is piled up. Halfway through the second round of the militia, I have eaten something, and after a short break, I re-entered the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unexpectedly, Fanner found himself calmer than he thought, heard the gun and received the gun, and the other handed it to the guns, and practiced on weekdays. The same. At first, some seemingly inexplicable regulations and action requirements came in handy at the moment, and they were incredibly effective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others are similar to themselves. Although their hands clench their guns, they look quite serious. Some of the substitutes are very nervous, but everyone’s body is standing. It’s straight, no one is going backwards but one step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
