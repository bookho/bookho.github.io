			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the second fire, Ai Gesha blocked her ears in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she saw an incredible scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no long-term power-saving work, and the seemingly large metal long tube shows a lightness that is completely inconsistent with it. Every time it is shot, it is like shaking. Earth, but the pedestal does not move, as if the two are unrelated. Each time the long tube is retracted and reset quickly and accurately, this process does not even require human control - only three of the four operators are busy, and the commander known as the iron axe simply stands by and gives orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retract the metal block, slide off the copper shell, insert a new arrow, and fire again... This cycle, Ai Gesha can feel almost every tenth The violent thunder of the sky, and the close-up shot also let her witness the two separate columns of snow and dirt from the two sides - the prince did not deceive, this weapon did launch the arrow, and The speed is too fast to be captured by the naked eye. Judging from the time when the fire broke out to the snow column, even if it is super-existing, it is absolutely impossible to avoid its attack! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha looked at this silver-white long tube weapon, can not help but some crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If...if Tacula can have such a powerful weapon at the time, it might be possible to stop the terrible devil under the wall, thus avoiding the destruction of the wall. After falling into the quagmire of the war of attrition, the war will not become so bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a weapon made by the witch?" For a while, she swallowed and whispered. Judging from its bright and shiny appearance, this is not something that ordinary people can use with their hands and hammers to knock them out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the prince’s answer made her a big surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The masterpiece of the witch and the mortal," he laughed. "The fortress gun is smelted to cast by the witch, and the shell used for the launch is the alchemist." By the way, in addition to Anna, the witches involved in the creation are all what you call the auxiliary witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha suddenly felt that it has been formed for a long time. The concept of a crack appeared. She thought she was tolerant enough to treat mortals, and she was even excluded by the Quest. But now it seems that I have not done enough? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the Federation wrong at the end? Is it true that the prince is right... "The mortal can defeat the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if the collaboration between the witch and the mortal can explode such a powerful force, why? A battle of divineness is still ending in a disastrous defeat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question continues to emerge in her mind, and Ai Gesha feels extremely confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly also felt strong when the squirt gun fired continuously Shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she had seen the scenes of artillery bombarding evil animals on the wall, the shortcomings of those firearms are also obvious - it is difficult to hit long distances, close to Attack down, only the middle distance can play the best power. However, the filling speed is slower. When dealing with agile mixed species, it is likely that it has not yet ignited, and the enemy has already reached the foot of the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, in order to quickly charge the gun, a gun group needs five to ten people to operate, as long as a problem occurs in one link, it will affect the operation of the weapon. Moreover, when the fire is needed, someone needs to look after the fire source. When the rain comes, the field guns may not be able to play any role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland’s newly developed fortress gun is no longer a disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charge from the back can make the muzzle lower than the breech, the range of close range is greatly increased, the rate of fire is several times, and the personnel are reduced. It’s three people. At the same time, there is no need to fire the fire, which means that the weather can also be combated by the bad weather. In addition, the attack range of the slinger is completely worthy of the word "epoch-making weapon" in the mouth of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it currently requires the ability of a witch to make, but Tilly believes this is only a temporary situation - Sylvie’s observation can be used as proof: once only the chief knight The burst weapon that can be equipped is now distributed to every soldier. Anna only needs to make a batch of equipment to produce the weapon. The specific casting and assembly can be done by the workers themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
