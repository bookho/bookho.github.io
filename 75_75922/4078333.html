			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddi thought it was just a threatening statement. I didn’t expect the other party to be serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the samurai warriors began to execute this order, a conflict broke out, and more than 50 first-time leavers were reluctant to accept such disagreements. Reasonable disposal, and the arresters are lumped together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, without weapons, they quickly lost under the sticks and shields of Aosa, one by one, and they were stripped of clothes and pressed down in the sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram personally performed the whipping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the suffering of the tribes, some clans are eager to move, but they stop at the front of the gray-steel people’s iron pipes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has heard of an example of an oasis watchdog being defeated overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the cavalry who came and went like a wind did not break through the defense of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rely on the delicate gray iron weapon in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screams on the shore have come and gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Aosha does not intend to let the inmates die, and the backs that have been beaten and smeared are coated with herbs after the show, and then wrapped tightly with gauze. - The cold evil moon is not the high incidence of plague. As long as they are strong enough, there should be no problem in living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolion and most of the tribes look a bit ugly, only Molly's face is full of happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After watching the execution, everyone was divided into two columns to the depths of the sand under the guidance of the whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the period, Thuram did not say a word, but everyone consciously maintained the order of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I arrived near the tower, Sinbad saw an oasis that was disappearing, or a pond - it was probably what Thuram said. The first army drinking water. There are no trees around the pond, only a few bushes of yellow shrubs are left. The bottom of the pond is very shallow, but one person is tall. Perhaps a few decades ago, it was still a vibrant oasis, and as the Yinchuan waters became increasingly exhausted, its final end was only turned into a yellow sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pond doesn’t say that it’s for the tribe to thrive, even if it’s used by hundreds of people who come here to work. Now I can still see the water, but it is because there is only a little stream in the underground waterway. When the summer comes, the water source is not enough for the sun... even if it is just not drinking, it will quickly evaporate into a piece. The cracked bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such an oasis ruins, Zimbabwe has seen a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, if the Grey Fortress cannot find a new source of water in the next two or three months, they can only withdraw from the area, let alone build a new one. The town is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram did not hide this, he walked by the team and shouted, "Is this pond not seen? The next few days, we have to drink The water is all from here. If you want to pee, please roll me a little farther. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...what to eat?" Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be people coming over, not enough, you can go fishing." Thuram replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the time, there is no need to worry about eating and drinking. The various clans have also settled a lot. Everyone is scattered in twos and threes, and the camp is set up according to the requirements of the Aosha manager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick disassembly and assembly of tents is a survival skill that every sandman must master. A sheepskin account that can withstand the cold can accommodate three to six people. Parts are usually carried by one person. The fish bone clan applied for only four women, so the simplest triangular account was set up, that is, the three tents were arranged in a triangle, fixed with hemp ropes, and the door opened outwards, which could serve as a mutual warning. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the afternoon, the whistle sounded again, and Thuram summoned everyone to a place near the coast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
