			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you travel east, the thinner the fog, but the sky is still gloomy, as if the sun could not penetrate the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding reefs are getting higher and higher, and gradually become a thick stone pillar. I don’t know why, the water level is obviously falling, the speed of the ship is still very stable, the sea surface Even the waves have been reduced, calming like a windless lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why don’t you wait for the seawater to completely fade before you enter the shadows?" Tilly asked inexplicably. "After all the reefs are exposed, you Don't be afraid to hit the rocks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because after the tide of the sea, we can't see the ghost red river, and it is to guide the explorers to the ruins. The only way," Thunder explained. "These pillar-like islands are not fixed. Every time the tide rises and falls, the position between the islands changes. And most of the marks are swallowed by the sea, so they cannot be used to locate the direction. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ghosts...Red River?" she repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. Look, this is--" Thunder whistled and pointed to the bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches looked in the direction he was pointing, and in the dark green water, there were several red figures - they passed by, as if phantom. But very quickly, there were two or three red shadows drifting over. This time, the ashes saw the target, which was actually a whole orange-red fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...fish?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The unique red squid in the Shadow Islands, "Thunder touched his chin and smiled. "You will see later, the true face of the ghost red river."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, more and more fish And no longer appear in twos and threes, but gather together and collectively swim in the direction of the stern - looking far ahead, the ashes are shocked by what they saw, and more and more fish are coming in. This torrent, a dark red thick line has appeared in the sea. The sailboat is clearly following this red line, and the fish pass through the bottom of the boat, and the ping-pong sound can be heard from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out that she suddenly realized that this is the ghost red river - a strange river that does not exist! As the ship continues to move forward, the densely populated fish has expanded into a parallel channel that can accommodate several boats. The dark green water is like a vane. The sailboat is like a fish on the fish. If not the opposite direction, she There is even a kind of illusion that the ship is carried by the fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is this?" Tilly asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egree also wants to ask this question. In the Grey Fort or other kingdoms, it is absolutely impossible to see such a scene - the fog around the periphery, the gloomy sky , grotesque boulder, and the "river" of red squid. For the first time, she was shocked by the wonders of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the main island," Thunder said, "It is like a triangular spire, with huge hollows in the middle of the tower, these red-scale fish I like to lay eggs in the hole and reproduce the offspring. When the tide is low, the hollow will surface, and the inhabited fish will always feel the change of the water level and flock out. So just follow the ghost red river, we You can reach the main island of Shadow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thunder, there are huge obstacles in front! It looks like a big mountain!" the screamer shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that we are coming," he shook his pipe. "Ladies, welcome to the Shadow Islands."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, the ash also saw the appearance of the main island. As the Thunder said, it is like a few triangles. The width is narrower and the surface looks very flat. It is not like Natural creation. But to say that the entire tower is cut out by the population, it is too amazing. The exposed tower is almost half the size of the city, and the hollow in the middle is enough to accommodate the tower of the Hermes church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is still retreating, the water at the top of the cave is sprinkled like a waterfall, and the submerged part is completely covered by the fish, within the horizon The sea is dyed into a red, gray sorrow can not help but imagine, there may be thousands of red scale fish living in the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until the sky is dark and the sea is completely retreat to the bottom of the hole. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Thunder ordered the sailors to stop the boat and connect them to the copper piles at the entrance with thick ropes. Standing on the edge of the giant hole, you can see the opposite opening from far away - the light incident from both ends can only illuminate a small range, and the center of the cavity is almost black, which makes people feel inexplicably suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the Thunder shook his head. "When I first came here, the copper piles already existed. They should all be built by the owners of the ruins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remains...Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and pointed upwards. "On our head, we are standing at the entrance to the ruins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next journey can only be described as incredible, the witches follow the Thunder Entering from a stone gate at the bottom of the cave, following the stone steps of the water, spiraling up and down. Although everyone is holding a torch, the pulsating fire is weak and small compared to the stairs that can't be seen at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness of the abyss, Tilly clung to the ashes of the arm, completely without the usual calmness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the princess of the princess who is familiar with him. In the palace, the five-worship woman who always has her own thoughts and is confident in any difficulty, the biggest weakness is fear of black. Even when you go to sleep at night, you have to light a candle in the room. When escaping from the palace, if there is no condition to do so, they will be accompanied by her to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the damp, dark spire, the mood of the ashes has become a lot more enjoyable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no evil beasts along the way, and there are no institutions that hinder the invaders - even if there is, long-term immersion in seawater is estimated to have long since expired It is. The only problem is that the long climb has exhausted most of the physical strength of the pedestrians, and everyone's movements have become slower and slower. When the stone steps finally came to an end, the team couldn't help but cheer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last level of the ruins is not a stone door, but a metal, which emits a bright reflection under the torch. The Thunder pushed the door hard with both hands, and the heavy door plate made a harsh rubbing sound and slowly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash single-handed sword, the first to enter the room, look around to confirm that there is no danger, then let Tilly and other witches step into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the torches hanging around the walls, a wide hall appears in front of everyone - although it is wide, it looks empty and can be swept at a glance. What is worth pondering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a relic?" She rubbed a stone-topped tabletop that was soaked in water. "With the exception of some stone tables and stools, there is nothing here." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is not much left," the Thunder nodded. "It has been sleeping on the seabed for too long. Everything except stone is difficult to preserve. I also Her Highness Tilly said, but she insisted on seeing it personally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about those red stones?" Tilly said, "Where are you?" Found?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the ground, it was scattered all over the place, probably dozens of them."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now there is nothing, the ashes look down at the slippery ground where the algae have grown, and the explorers who arrive here are not only one of the Thunder, but also find the magic stone. It is a strange thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Tilly is still full of interest, she holds the torch and carefully looks at every corner of the hall, especially in the dark, she will let the sailors add more Support the torch. Molly summoned the magic servant, spread out on the ground, paved the floor for everyone to rest, and the ashes followed Tilly, watching her touch it on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Suddenly, the five kings stopped their steps. "What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The ashes followed her gaze, only on the wall covered with a green moss, faintly reflected a little fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tili reached out and tore off the green moss, and saw a piece of gems buried in the stone wall exposed - it also showed bright red, and magic stone It is generally crystal clear, prismatic, almost has the thickness of the arm, but the periphery is embedded with gold filaments, like a card slot to fix it inside. Even after soaking in the sea for so long, the gold wire wrapped around the stone is still as clean as new. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly tried to pull out and the jewels did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
