			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They...is the weak? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this thought came out, Niegen was completely in the same place, he subconsciously regarded it as nonsense, but the facts were relentlessly reminded With him, even if he holds a weapon, he can't beat each other in two-to-one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hate Roland Wimbledon, hate the Grey Fort, and hate the firearms more precisely because of this unreasonable thing, let a low-lying Civilians can also threaten knights who have been practicing for more than a decade. Those who should have been kneeling at their feet and relying on their shelter to live, this is the tradition of thousands of times, the order recognized by the world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the firearm does not exist, the elder brother and he will still be the warrior in the past! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women in front of us not only did not use firearms, not even the blade of the army - they lost to each other in their most confident aspects. This incredible facts and beliefs smashed together, leaving him a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a witch, the best thing is to swear the sorrow... win by strength? Don’t make me laugh!” Talos gasped deeply. "But it is the use of unclean power, polluting my god stone... Cough, if the Hermes church is still there, how dare you show up here? In addition to tarnishing the traditional king of the gray castle, you It’s the best person to go to hell!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Far!” A man’s voice suddenly came in from the front of the car. “I am a member of the church. There are not hundreds of witches, there are dozens of them, they not only show their heads, but also say that my car is driving well! And the past and present leaders are witches, you tell me tradition? This is the fucking tradition! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigan and Talos couldn’t help but look at each other-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is clearly the driver speak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hijack the coachman, leave here first, and then have the opportunity to retaliate back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as someone drags this wolf a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the strength of both, this is naturally a stronger brother to do better -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; However, without waiting for Niegan to open, Talos suddenly grabbed him and shouted him to the wolf girl! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother--" He looked at the other side with disbelief and turned to the front of the car, leaving only a fast-moving back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman took a ruthless shot and landed him on the ground, then added a foot to his head, and a hammer-like blow made him black. I quickly lost consciousness. Just before the interruption of the horror and despair, he vaguely heard the whisper from the top of his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people over there are not what you can handle..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten The distance between the steps was only in the blink of an eye. Talos would have to rush to the front of the cab, and a figure suddenly came out from behind the front of the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man is also a woman, wearing a dark gray uniform, as they have observed before, is the dress of a four-wheeled driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original big car is equipped with two drivers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person can’t be a witch anymore? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it’s just an ordinary person, there’s no difference between one and two – or one is enough to drive him! Compared to the man who shouted, it is clear that women are better controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taros plans to leave the other side first, then kill the guy who dares to refute him. As for the iron rod held by the female driver, he did not look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached for the towel, he yelled at each other, and while he was running, he raised the dagger at the same time, aiming to shock the woman and directly use his sword to resist the neck. Threatening her to submit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even more surprised he is still behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female driver’s body is slightly on the side, and the iron stick is placed on the top of the head with both hands, which is clearly the starting style! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy... knows swordsmanship? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea just emerged, the other party has already moved forward, and he waved his iron bar straight to him-<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of big and big move is completely based on life, if in the eyes of laymen, it is no different from finding death, but Talos seems to A single shot actually waved the top of the mountain. And the iron bar that splits in front of the front seems to expand dozens of times, covering the path of all his actions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything happened too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is in full force, there is no room to avoid, if you keep your posture, you may be able to pierce the tip of the sword into her neck, but This stick will undoubtedly bring him to his head! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply - unreasonable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taros found that the body responded before the consciousness, he hurriedly turned the blade, his hands crossed to the top of the head, want to block this hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Break!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman's iron rod is in the middle of the blade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the great strength, the bending of the short sword quickly exceeds the limit, and the slamming cracks open! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sticks are not lost, the shards carrying Mars and splashing are on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could this be...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taros only felt a loud bang in his ear, even He couldn't make a sound, and he fell to the ground stiffly, and he kept twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is the body’s spontaneous reaction, and his consciousness has long been in a coma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Solved?" Joe cautiously poked his head out of the car window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, if he chooses a thorn in the end, maybe he can play a few more rounds." Farina licked the blood on the wrench. If you withdraw, you will have enough blows. Of course, your temptation is also very important and beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe snorted, "Don't forget I used to be a nobleman, and the nobles are best at swearing - to ensure that there is no repetition in a hundred sentences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina looks up Look at the people she needs, "It's obviously aristocrats, but you are so different from them... I sometimes get confused, why is the difference between people so great, is this the meaning of the Creator?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also...very different." Joe slightly turned his gaze, but quickly looked back again. "So I will be your prison." Attractive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farina..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&& Nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, I am sorry," Luo Jia interrupted the two people's confrontation, "Is that person dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw the wolf The attacker who stunned the female single-handed man went to the front of the car and threw it on the other person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... I think there should be a sigh of relief." Farina replied. "You already knew we were here before?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia nodded. "I heard your footsteps. Not only did you notice the noise here, but you can quickly set the enemy tactics. It is the original. Judging the army commander."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have basically lost their fighting spirit after they have played against you. I am just taking advantage of it." Farina smiled. The words you just said are quite reasonable. If there is a chance in the future, can I still have a discussion with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
