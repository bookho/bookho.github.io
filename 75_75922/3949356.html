			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland learned that there was a brigade approaching the next morning, and the routine patrol of lightning found this slow-moving team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What, more than a thousand people?" He groaned, not a good 50-member messenger group? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uh huh," McMug added. "But there are not many horseback riding, only six!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people who walked...what are they wearing and weapons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put ordinary, most people have no armor, just ordinary The linen clothes," said Lightning. "The weapons are also various, but there are hundreds of people who have backed their spears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So poor equipment level Are they all forced civilians or serfs? Roland wondered, there was no special training for the militia in this era. To put it bluntly, it was responsible for carrying the grass and heavy logistics team for the Cavaliers. Sometimes it could be used as cannon fodder and consume the enemy's arrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Tefco wants to solve himself by force, it is impossible not to understand the battle that erupted between the Long Song Fortress and Bianbu Town. More than two hundred knights of the Duke of Ryan’s coalition failed to touch the side of the town, not to mention the group of militiamen who ran on their legs. Ming knows that the battle process and the result will have to march into the town. They can only say that they are sure to break through the dense line of guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but think of the church’s pills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he guessed whether the church supported the company and Garcia at the same time, whether it was accompanied by the mention of Feike. If these people have pills, the situation will be completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can make humans run faster than horses in a short period of time, without fear of pain, that is, the line of guns will face more than a thousand The impact of the "Knight", as long as one person rushed into the team, will bring casualties to the First Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the First Army is no longer an army more than two months ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revolver rifle has only been refitted for a hundred, but the firepower delivery density has far exceeded the rifle force, especially for the shooter. After loading the hand, enemies entering the 300-meter range will encounter continuous attacks. The artillery team also expanded after the fortress battle, from the original four groups to the current twenty groups, each with a 12-pound field gun modified, increased the diameter, so that the effective range increased to kilometers the above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland thought of another question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you notice that those walking people have the stone to wear God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I dare not be too close," Lightning pointed to McMillan. "This guy has become more clear than I saw after the eagle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter Shaking his head, "I didn't see it, maybe it was hidden in my clothes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way..." Roland thought, "You bring a nightingale again." Fly a glimpse. Only one person can have a flying height of about ten meters? You will fly along the Chishui River, and the maiden will be responsible for the front warning. If you encounter a passing ship, you will move from the nightingale to the foggy state." Nightingale, "After approaching the enemy, you are observing whether the large forces carry the stone of the gods at a distance, and do not attack without authorization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." In line with the lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the three were ready to leave, Roland stopped them. "Remember, safety is of the utmost importance and protect yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem," the night blinked and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the witches left, he was a little uneasi, and was the last sentence too much like a flag? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is also aware of the major mistakes in his work, that is, the intelligence control of the Long Song Fortress is too weak - if it is not Pei Luo sent a messenger, himself It is very likely that you will encounter a situation that is discovered when the enemy hits the door. Once caught in street fighting, the first army that lost its firepower advantage is difficult to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
