			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the strangest team that Rennes Meade has seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the square table in the first floor of the castle, there is a long song fortress detail. There are a total of six people around the square table. They are the first army commanding iron axes, the police captain from the Bianbu town, Vader, the current leader of the fire gang. The bones, the head of the Security Bureau, the nightingale, the black-haired witch, the ashes, and the self as the Earl of Elk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan never thought that he would need the help of a mouse one day, and he never thought about working with a witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You adults, there are almost seven or eight gangs in the fortress," the cracked bones showed a flattering smile, bent over, "the most members are There are almost five or six hundred people in the northern part of the outer city. But the strongest is the death knell of the inner city. Most of them are composed of fugitives and mercenaries. They almost do not accept the participation of ordinary civilians, regardless of the blade and armor. There are a lot of them. Of course, if this is not the case, it will not occupy the most fat position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The east of the city is the site of rot and vulture By the convenience of the dock area, they mainly do the slave trade and the dream water, and the way of doing things is particularly cruel. I heard that the two mouse organizations stood behind the running wolf family and Maple family, but we were helped by our fire several years ago. When the fight was over, I didn’t see any big aristocrats coming out to help them.” He was a little proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as the city is concerned, the gangs are much more complicated...because they are all small gangs, I only deal with their bosses at most. They are ——”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The news of the gang is not important, so there is no need to elaborate here,” the tall Mokins interrupted. “I only I want to ask, can you take us to the nest of these underground mice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, this adult..." The bones nodded toward him. "As the saying goes, mice build nests, ten holes and nine holes. I know the main gathering places of the gangs, but it is impossible to know even their refuge, especially those that use dry wells and basements. The leader and the cronies only know the specific location."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He didn't say anything wrong," Rennes sighed. "To face hard, the mouse is not at all." But if you want to clean them one by one, I’m afraid it’s hard to do.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is still a chance to launch the attack, but now the notice has been issued, and when the action is taken, the leaders should have long been hiding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where?" The black-haired witch laughed. "Unless he hides in Chishui City, as long as he stays in the fortress, there are no people we can't find."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, you are right." The cracked bone wiped the sweat on his forehead and no longer disputed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This screaming witch is so stressful that Ryan has been on the battlefield and has also fought with the evil beast in Hermes. He knows the truth. What the warrior should look like...but even those trials that have been through battles will be eclipsed in front of her. The other party does not need to show any scary appearance. Just standing there can make people dare not look straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, she not only saw the blood, captured the enemy's life, but also survived the edge of life and death, in order to have such a tempting momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to His Royal Highness, we still have three days to prepare. After the first batch of rations is issued, the army starts from the North Gate and clears the regions in turn. The mouse gang." The iron axe sighed. "This attack is only for the organizers, and strives to disintegrate the black street in the shortest possible time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... ...Does this really work?" Seeing the other person walking towards the door of the hall, Ryan couldn't help but ask, "No city has ever been able to eliminate rats. As long as there are people, they will not be determined."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe looked back at him and said, "Yes, there is no mouse in Bianbu Town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the people left, only Vader stayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
