			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t expect the other’s question to be digging for himself, and the source of the pit was buried when he wrote 20 books. under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that when people first come into contact with such huge and complex information, it’s hard to understand. It’s impossible to notice the flaws – as a study of the nature of the world. The natural sciences, from the end to the end without mentioning the word magic is absolutely incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland himself completely forgot the memory of the Four Princes, except that he consciously imitated each other in the first month of the crossing, and then I have not worried about this. The minister did not dare to question in person, and he did not need to conceal himself in front of the witch. He became more and more unscrupulous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Tilly is not a general witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to being the sister of the Four Princes, she is an extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only read through all the books in a short period of time, but also keenly noticed this unreasonable point, the logical thinking is as clear as one Modern people after universal education. Not only that, she used her questions to guide her own opinions, and the two confirmed each other, almost making themselves incontrovertible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great crisis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s thoughts are sharp, but there is no viable response. For those who can see this, any far-fetched explanations are only It will aggravate the other's doubts, and a lie needs to be covered by more lies, and the loopholes will only be more and more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hustle and bustle of silence, Tilly spoke again. This time her voice eased a lot. "You don't have to rush to tell me the answer, today's time." It’s too late, I will go back to the Witch House first, and you will rest earlier, Your Highness.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ah... um,” Roland looked at the gray The woman, who didn’t know what was in her pupil’s mouth, even forgot to get up and see off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly stopped at the door of the office and turned to him. "Can I believe you?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is normal, Roland will not hesitate to pat his chest and say yes, but at this time, he found that he could not easily say the promise, and finally just nodded slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door was closed, the nightingale called the road. "She actually left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "How do you look like a very regrettable look?" Roland gave her a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I feel that your real experience is almost a little bit worse," the nightingale spit out his tongue. "Why don't she ask a few more questions?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because she didn't want to even have friends in the end," the prince sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啥?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...nothing," Roland leaned back on the chair. I felt the coolness behind the scenes. Tilly’s performance can be described as impeccable. She did not ask herself too much. It is that as an ally of the island, Bianyi Town is undoubtedly the most powerful partner. In the current situation of the enemy, allies More important than the truth of identity. If the allies are broken due to the investigation of this issue, it is not good news for the sleeping island witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Tilly will choose to leave after asking questions and leave a buffer time for herself, but this does not mean she does not need an answer, if she has been dragging it down, When the threat of foreign enemies is lifted, the trust of the other party will be lost. Now that she has put down this piece of chess, it is her turn to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland can’t reveal the real news to Tilly, at least not now – Anna and Nightingale are not big problems, they know themselves from the beginning After all, Kelly is the sister of the Four Princes. Before she can understand what she thinks about the Four Princes, he must bury this news in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shake your head and let go of these troublesome things. Roland looks at the nightingale. "You just heard the conversation. I am going to let you and McMug. , lightning in the past to ask about the situation, how?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
