			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire rose from her feet and quickly faded away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the twenty-third practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Animal has already sweated on her forehead, she rubbed it with her back, and the heat suddenly began to swell and gave a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't stop at all, and then started the next exercise. The witch's uniform was folded neatly and set aside. If it wasn't for her insistence on doing this at first, I am afraid that the clothes have been turned into ashes in the flames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, as Roland is a four prince, it is not difficult to get a few spares. He asked Tyre to send a whole bucket of robes - all collected temporarily from the maids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twenty-fourth practice finally came to fruition, the flame no longer rises from the foot, but appears in her palm out of thin air. She carefully lifted her arm and tried to move it to her fingertips, but the flame swayed twice, suddenly slamming her arm, igniting her sleeves, and swallowing her robes along her sleeves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna took the flames and pulled off the black robes with a blank expression, turning to the bucket and looking for new ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Roland would look away from his eyes and let his eyes stare at other places - even though the other party didn't care about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if it is not Roland’s strong request, she will probably take off the light to practice. But then Roland couldn't watch it well. He couldn't calmly face a naked girl—especially when the little girl turned into a flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head and left the distracting thought behind his head. For the time being, it is not easy to master this power. The stage goal he set for Anna was to let the flames escape from the palms or fingers, not to lick the clothes on the body, and to maintain a high enough temperature to melt the pig iron in the pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the 30th practice failed, Roland stopped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resting will be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna looked at him slyly, no response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland had to go over and pull up the girl’s hand and take it to the chair, forcing her to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are tired, you should take a break when you are tired, don't be too reluctant, our time is still very long," he wiped her sweat Wet forehead, "First eat an afternoon tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows that the nobility of the Grey Fort Kingdom does not enjoy the habit of afternoon tea. The productivity of this world is so poor that it is difficult for people to have a leisurely taste of fine food. The meals are not popular, let alone four meals. As for the dumb children who are doing nothing, this time they usually gather in bars or casinos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this habit, create a good one, the snacks are ready-made, and the tea can't be replaced with ale – knowing that you are going to a remote border town, The four princes brought their maids, servants and cooks to the brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first afternoon tea party was held in the simple wooden shed in the back garden of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna looked at the beautiful dim sum of the dish and couldn’t believe her eyes. Why can you eat something so good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she can’t name the name of the pastry, the combination of pure white appearance and bright red fruit itself makes people feel appetite, especially the pastry. Embraced with a few delicate patterns, this made her world view once again be engraved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smugly looked at Anna’s overwhelmed expression, not the strawberry cream cake, to scare your bun. And the strawberry is still marinated in sugar and the taste is not fresh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
