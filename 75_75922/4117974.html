			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else?" Ashes asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All aspects...so we have a longer life span than a mortal, a healthier body, a stronger self-healing power, and a higher plasticity." Liz slowly said, "And this includes our disposition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the meaning of temperament?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we are eager to use magic to achieve a certain purpose, the magic will lead us in that direction - for example, to avenge a dead partner, to kill the devil at all costs, etc. The witch's heart will become more and more indifferent, or ruthless." Felice looked at the swaying fire. "For the fighters, this really makes them stronger, but it will gradually make us Become another type of thing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Non-human. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash can't help but be tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought of the past who was looking for an opportunity to kill the church staff, but also desperate. At that time, it was indeed her most powerful time. The surging sentiment in her heart gave her nearly infinite power. She could leave it alone. She had nothing. If she did not meet the five kings, she would be no different from the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not everyone will be like this, this is just a trend - the pressure of war makes most living people have no time to take care of others, even if there is no magic Mortal people will be driven crazy in the face of a long, hopeless battle. Compared to them, we have at least turned madness into power, which is very good." Felice went on to say, "So at that time the federation The series of accidents that occurred may be difficult to understand in your opinion, but it was a matter of course at the time. Without the firm determination, the three seats could not be superb."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that..." Ashes reached out and dialed the fire. "If the battle of divineity continues, what will the witch eventually become?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "Nobody knows the answer, maybe even the appearance will change," Felice said with ease. "After all, the superior beauty is judged by the human perception. If it is not even the end." Maybe it will become strange, . As is also rare like the devil "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; the flames shaking up temporarily silence enveloped the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the god-destroyed witch reopened. "I can ask, why did you decide to fight the devil?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably aware of the hesitation of the ashes, she volunteered, "Our goal is simple, defeat the devil, win the battle of God, reinvigorate the glory of Takira - if not This belief, the surviving witches are not up to today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to rebuild Tacila?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, that is where we have dedicated our lives. But it will be more of a symbol than the holy city under the rule of the federation. If Roland can defeat the devil, It proves that he is more correct than the three seats. Since the collaboration between witches and mortals can bring broader prospects, we have no reason not to support them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment of silence, I replied, "I just want to protect a person and help her achieve her wish. Since she wants to drive the devil out of the dawn. Then I will be on her behalf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Felice shook her head. "Excuse me, this is not a good belief." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the goal is too broad." "It's easy for you to lose yourself, especially at the juncture of life and death. A person's wish is hard to define, not to mention, more importantly... Do you really know what she wants?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course--" Ashes said that half suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly would want her to fight against the devil on the front line? The answer is obviously no, this is just her own decision. If the previous phantom instrument positioning action is necessary to go to the dangerous place for the other party, this sniper war Tilly does not need to personally participate, but she still joined the team at the invitation of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
