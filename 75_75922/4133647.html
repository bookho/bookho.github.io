			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the crowd dissipated, the old man boarded the train again, the lightning came close, flew into the cab from the back window, and quietly landed in the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man stood in front of the console, looked down at the contents of his hand and motionless, and his figure was like a silent statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the back of the other person, she wants to comfort a few words, but does not know how to open it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until hesitant touched the half-opened window leaf, the other party noticed her existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, you are the little girl that day..." The old man blinked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is lightning." Lightning can't help but take a step back, "Sorry, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I understand, are you here to comfort me?" He suddenly grinned. "Oh, really, I am not old enough to need a little girl to comfort, let you laugh. But the witch The ability is really convenient, and I can freely go where I want to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person’s expression is not as sad as the lightning imagination, which makes her nervous The mood was a little relaxed. "I, I will knock on the door next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not blaming you, child." The old man put down the wall The folding table, rubbed with the sleeves, "Come, sit here, I will pour you a cup of tea - this is the only place that can be used to entertain people."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you...thank you." Lightning slowly walked to the table and sat down. It was only after she found out that she was on the console with a winterless ID card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Bruch, or you can call my nickname directly: Mr. Da Yumen. The little devils in the car often call me that." The old man brought a cup of hot tea to the table. "You just attended the funeral?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning nodded first, then shook his head again," I just flew over the sky and watched it for a while..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That proves that you have not lost any partners, this is really good news." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clenched the teacup, "Your son..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, he called Robert, the third child in the family, died in the battle for the artillery position." Bruce said calmly. "The battalion commander said he was brave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is really brave." Lightning whispered. From Sylvie, she heard about the whole process of the battle. In the absence of fire support and the punishment of the witch, the attack of the devil's spear was launched. If there is not enough courage, it is impossible to take that step. of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, the oldest was the most timid one. When mining in a mine, no matter how the bulls bully him, he would not dare to fight back. I will come back and cry to me." Brucher said with emotion, "Do you feel weird, I don't look so sad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl screamed, "No, I-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter," the old man said with relief, "because I know that there will be such a day sooner or later... whether it is the third or the other two My son, I have said the same thing to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did they say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "They said, they want to protect the winter city, want to protect the hometown, this is hard to get everything." The old man drank a cup of tea, "To tell the truth, I did not understand at the time, but also asked why they are, and Not someone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning is also asking why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruce is like seeing her thoughts, "The answer is that others have already sacrificed."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the militia against evil spirits, some people continue to fall on the front line, resisting the Duke of Ryan, and the same is true against the church. If everyone thinks about why they are themselves and not others We should stay in the mine now and live the same life as the livestock.” The old man said, “As long as it is fighting, there will inevitably be sacrifices. Who is the turn, if everyone is not willing to go, this is also You don't have to fight, you still have to kill the enemy in the end - this is what they said to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flashing computer, the words of the other party emerged that night. "In the past, they used to be similar to mice. They were thin and weak, but since they joined the army, they changed like a person inside and outside. This is also my first. The reason why a military is full of confidence - a team of such people cannot be easily defeated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out to be like this...<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I have to say thank you to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you... I?" Lightning smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," the old man smiled. "Without your timely notification, the camp will suffer even more. In a sense, you also protect The first army, and my other son. I am still thinking about when you will meet you next time. Maybe you can't touch it anymore. I didn't expect you to appear directly behind me - face to face It’s great to say thank you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking tea, lightning waved to bid farewell to Bruch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She flew out of the original road, passing the front of the carriage, seeing the old man returning to the console through the window glass, grabbing the identity Proof, rubbed his face with his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the residential area, McMug is hovering in the air, as soon as he sees lightning I rushed up. "Where are you going? How come back! Why have you forgotten today's big event?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today is the day when Luo Jia was discharged!" Mai Hao gathered her wings and landed on her head. "Go to the medical clinic!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... well, I know, don't sway." Lightning up the pigeons and flew towards the center of the camp. After the last night attack, the layout of the tower No. 1 station has undergone great changes, overlooking from the air, except for the platform, the yard and the sentry tower, the rest are flat. Functional buildings such as barracks and medical clinics have all sank into the ground. The fire-fighting power points can cover the outer ring of the defense line, and can also take care of the interior. Even if the devil is re-applied, it is difficult to pose a big threat like the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t wait long, they saw the familiar figure of the wolf woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Luo Jia shook his ears. "Long time no see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s only a week.” Lightning finally breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the other’s spirit. After all, listening to the description of the state of the wolf woman when she was carried into the medical office, she would have to swallow when she followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably sleeping every day, I feel that time is getting longer." Luo Jia stretched out. "Nanawa is really, yes. It took a week to recover the wound. I think that after a week, the wound can heal itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the side effects of the witch against the sleeping fern are much higher than The average person, therefore, in the case of no life-threatening, the sleeping treatment can usually save the magic of the therapist, which is also the experience accumulated by the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a monster-like resilience, just like the ashes!" McMug patted his wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... Ever since I talked to Miss Andelia, I always thought it was not a boast." Luo Jia whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, nothing." She walked to the side of the lightning, hands crossed Live the little girl's arm and lift the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hello... what are you doing, let me down." Lightning suddenly twitched. "Someone is watching!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard Sylvie say, everything you did."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I-"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, you can still do it with your efforts," Luo Jia said, holding the lightning into his arms. "This is the leader I am familiar with." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
