			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barov returned to the City Hall office and immediately closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My God, he touched the stone of God's punishment on his chest, and His Highness was really possessed by the devil. For this, there was some faint speculation before, and now he is almost certain that the person who just spoke to him will never be the Four Princes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great change in character or an eccentricity can be understood, but suddenly comprehend things that have never been touched, and have mastered the knowledge that has never been heard before? This kind of thing will only happen in the mythical biography, but the legend is that the gods are possessed by mortals, leading humans out of the predicament, when does the devil love to do this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Roland Wimbledon runs his territory as Wangdu looks (although that is difficult), Barov is not surprised, saying four The prince does not learn anything, but his character can be disguised. Maybe someone secretly teaches him how to govern a city or even a country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the ideas and plans that the prince spoke out, the assistant to the minister is unheard of. He has been in the Wangdu City Hall for 20 years. As the finance minister, he is very good at the structure and operation of the city hall. The ministers are in charge of all functions, and apart from the private agreement, no one will sell any accounts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the king issued a decree, the minister who received the order gave it to the people under his hand to do it. Every minister has his own power and his style of action is also Different. For example, the steel-hearted knight who is responsible for the defense of the Grey Fortress, he controls hundreds of patrols and mercenaries, and is also influential to the underground organizations in the city. When he was working, he was stalking, and the criminals he was eyeing, even the nobles, could hardly stay in the city, or leave the king, or wait to be locked into the cell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than just the king, the same is true of other cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you want to become a lord or a king, you must first be a great aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t have enough money to recruit, do you want to do it yourself? The more people there are, the more they will be valued by the higher authorities - because people do a good job, everyone understands this truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the prince’s approach completely overturned Barov’s ideas. The minister is also good, the minister's men are good, everyone is recruited and paid by the city hall, that is to say, even if a minister is not there, a new one is, even one person can be promoted directly from below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a brand new system, and Barov is sure that the prince wants to create a political system that is very different from the upper level of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone might think that this is just Roland’s whimsy, or is a layman’s self-righteous? But the assistant to the minister did not think so. He took a quill and recorded the requirements of His Royal Highness on paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at these plans, they are interlocking, taking into account every detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to manage to eat and drink Lazar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barof naturally knows that the stronger the control of the people, the more orders issued by the lord are implemented faster, but this has greatly improved Manage the number of people, first, where to find so many people who can read and write? Second, the extra salary is a heavy burden on the lord, and few people are willing to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review the other two of His Royal Highness, recruit civilians to enter the city hall, and educate all civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he swept through the two lines of text with his fingers, he couldn’t help but shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If both of these things have been achieved by His Royal Highness, what will Bentham Town look like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any civilian can read and write, and the City Hall can find a large number of suitable personnel whenever they want to expand their scale. This will in turn promote education popularization - access to education will have the opportunity to enter the city hall, get a well-paid position, and bring about the improvement of social status, I am afraid that in one or two years, everyone will take the initiative to ask If you are educated, you will want to send your child to the college even if you can't do it yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
