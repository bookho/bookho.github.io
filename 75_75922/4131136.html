			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter whether it is a head, a dress or a face, Anna is not the most out of the witches - for the convenience of construction, she tied her supple hair into a The ponytail; the overalls are the only style of the underarm design, but it does not seem to take into account the beauty and comfort. The cuffs and collars are tightly closed together, and staying in the wild for a long time, the clothes are also dusty. It looks a bit gray. If you are seeing such a scene for the first time, I am afraid that it cannot be associated with the Queen of Graysburg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Moryl’s heart is envious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because even if you don’t know the identity of the other queen, you will understand that she must be an important person--is a high-ranking official without a winter city. For example, the construction minister Carl Vabert, the head of the General Staff Department, Itis Kant, etc. ... the direction of the railway, the speed of advancement and the construction arrangements, all need to be negotiated with His Royal Highness Anna. In other words, even if she is not a witch, it is still the focus of everyone's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they couldn’t understand what they were talking about, Morley still felt that standing on the heights and looking into the distance, holding the map and pointing the way His Royal Highness is really handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the blue eyes of the pair of lakes, the light that is transmitted when they focus on work, is like an innocent gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of such people, whether it is a recruit or a veteran, they should involuntarily pay attention to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly thought about it, but eventually did not disturb Anna's Highness, but drove the magic servants to avoid the crowd and unload the rails in the yard area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you going to the forest again?" Just put down the track, Sawyer came out from behind a pile of bricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mollyton raised a bad premonition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ran to the bricks and swept, and she saw a familiar card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, isn't this a little Morel," Andrea grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides there is a witch who seems to be overwhelmed, Maggie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are actually lazy to play cards here!" Molly muttered. "If you let others find out, what do you think of our sleepy curse? I am going Tell Tilly adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes... they forced me to come here," Maggie lowered her head and pointed her index finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is lazy?" Sawyer disobeyed the air. "These red bricks are all shipped from the train, or the workers are still unloading." How can you be lazy when things are busy?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Be aware that work and afternoon tea are equally important, and it’s elegant to be both "The way of doing things." Andrea licked the golden hair, "Not to mention that Maggie is there, to ensure that no one can find us - after all, even tired of Tily adults is never allowed behavior, you can rest assured Right, you want to join us? Four people are more interesting than the three-person team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not--" Moryl just thought The rejection of righteous words was interrupted by a sudden alarm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“呜————呜————呜————”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 The sound short number represents the discovery of the enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hurriedly looked northeast, but in the wilderness of the wilderness, nothing but the mottled snow and weeds that had not been fully opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy is not that Sylvie is lightning them, warnings issued at that distance, you can't see the trace anyway." Remind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well - Your Highness Anna!" Morrill suddenly remembered the Queen of the Grey Fort, still on the front line of the railway. She has heard more than once that Anna’s ability has an irreplaceable significance for Roland’s and No Winter City. In this case, how to bring the other person back safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a natural guard around Anna's Highness. You can't help much in the past." The latter shook his head. "Even if you follow the speed of the flying devil, you have at least ten to fifteen minutes of preparation time from the discovery to the enemy. Be sure to hide it. And according to the principle of hedging, if you do not arrange the battle mission in advance, the first thing you should do when encountering a sudden enemy situation is to protect yourself first, then then to the nearest First Army, Takira, to punish the witch. Or other combat groups are close together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you don't have to go anywhere, concentrate on protecting me," I don't know when, Andrea has been holding a pike. At the top of the brick, "The next step is my job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Sawyer said, when Molly also climbed the bricks At the time, the vast construction site was empty, as if the previous busy scene had never happened. In the ditch, the surging head can be faintly seen. A black rifle is erected and the train stops running. The entire line is filled with chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silvi, is the enemy you found?" Andrea took a listening note from her arms, "How many?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...No, it’s an early warning of lightning," after a while, the answer from the other party was sent from the other side. "The enemy seems to have only four The horror of the madman, the direction is on your right, there is no sign of the high-level devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only four? It seems that it is just an encounter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, but don't relax your vigilance." Hillvi said. "In five minutes, you should be able to see them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the devil arrives as if the four shadows are particularly eye-catching under the clear sky. Similarly, they undoubtedly see the railways appearing on the fertile plains. line. The strange thing is that the enemy did not immediately launch an attack, but hovered in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they hesitating?" Sawyer frowned. "This is not like the style of the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Can you hit them?" Moryl asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the distance is too far," Andrea shrugged. "Even if you throw all the coins, there won't be one up. Of course, There is no other way -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly automatically ignores what she doesn't understand, "What method?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example...for a bigger caliber gun." She smiled and pointed her finger at the brick. "Can I borrow your magical servant to use it?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Moryl noticed that there was an amazing firearm there, and the barrel was more than one meter long, and she immediately realized it. The other party's meaning - it is impossible to manipulate such a heavy weapon by the power of one person alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you...do you carry this when you play cards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is all Maggie’s credit,” Andrea said, “and it’s possible to carry the weapon with you, but it’s a basic requirement for a warrior.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Molly no longer speaks, she raises her hand to summon a magical servant, grabs a giant firearm on the top of the head, and at the same time makes Mo Mota down and spreads into an oval cushion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity that the last action didn’t bring you," Andrea squatted and tried to test. "This gun seat is much more comfortable than the ash." The head is raising a little, right, that is the angle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now?" Morrier adjusted the shape of the servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's just right. Right, can you shrink its arm? It's as small as the finger thickness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is fine...but it won't be able to grab heavy objects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, keep it." Leah stuffed the narrowed servant's arm into her ear and then held the gun. "You don't forget to block your ears!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
