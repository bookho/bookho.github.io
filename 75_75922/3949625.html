			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people who came to pick up the second meal was a little more, but fortunately the three had been waiting in the square and grabbed a more advanced position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until really joining the queue, Snakes understand why these fences are built around the wooden platform - the speaker on the stage has changed one person, still lingering Telling about the new policy, probably before listening to the porridge, I have to listen to him all the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd slowly moved forward and waited for about a quarter of an hour, and he finally got around the wooden platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Extending the right hand back," said the guard who was waiting here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the snake tooth was done, the other party pressed a seal on the back of his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wooden fence is here to expand to both sides, An open area, but the queue is still not over, everyone under the guidance of the guards in turn receive wooden bowls, porridge, go to the other end to drink porridge, put the bowl. It is hard to believe that this orderly order is actually created by ordinary civilians and mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snakes looked back and looked at the long line behind their eyes, and they could not help but feel a sense of absurdity, as if they were not begging for the charity of others, but In the completion of a solemn ceremony in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did he print on us?" The tiger's claws poked their heads from behind, "can't wipe it off."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably prevent us from queuing after we have finished porridge," he grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are high camps on the periphery of the open space. Through the fire, you can see that there are many people in the bustle. From time to time, some people carry the heavy wooden barrels to the fence. The long wooden table was distributed to the guards by the guards. Apparently these foods were cooked. When the white porridge was poured into the bowl, the snake's hands could not help but tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long has he not tasted overheated food? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The porridge is not strong, and there is no added leaf and seasoning, but this white porridge noodle and overflowing scent has already made him saliva. I can’t stop it. Compared to the black bread mixed with stones and chaff, the food in the bowl made him realize the long-lost sweetness again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops, the eyes started to get sour again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without hot tongue, the snakes drank a bowl of porridge two or three times, and licked the bottom of the bowl. Although the bottom of my heart had the urge to run back and ask for a bowl, but he saw the guards around him, he finally dismissed the idea. Reluctantly put the wooden bowl into the designated basin, he followed the crowd out of the fence area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a wooden stand at the exit, and the presenter is enthusiastically answering the questions of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably there is warm food in the stomach, even the bragging wind is not so sloppy before, the snake tooth can not help but slow down Follow the crowd slowly to the wooden platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you ask the prince to give relief food? This question is well asked!" said the man, "because His Highness is determined to thoroughly reinforce the mouse in the fortress." Cleared out, those who have been coerced by rats and have to obey them for food, can be completely liberated and no longer need to be threatened by them! At the same time, some families with insufficient food can also overcome the difficulties! This is His Royal Highness. "Benevolence!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you said that the porridge is only distributed until the end of the evil month, what should I do after that?" someone asked aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene sound suddenly subsided a lot, most people will be waiting for the other party's answer, the snake teeth also raised their ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple! You can feed yourself!" The speaker laughed. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "own ...... feed themselves?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "I can not farming ah." < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, let me tell you slowly!" He waved his hand. "After the end of the evil month, the long song fortress and the border town will be merged into a new city. The middle land needs a lot of workers to open and build. This is your feeding. Your own method! Labor, only labor can create wealth, only labor can change fate! You will get a stable salary, this money can not only support themselves, but also support the family! At the same time, His Royal Highness promises that all have a formal The people who work will be accepted as the people of the new city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His words stirred up a wave in the crowd, and the snakes felt their heart beat fast. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I know what you are thinking," the preacher sighed. "There are a lot of mice among you... or, by It’s a city citizen who is forced to become a mouse, but it doesn’t matter. Through labor, you will be reborn – you don’t have to sneak a life in the ground without seeing it, and you don’t have to worry about being sent to the gallows one day. You can rely on your own hands. In exchange for a proper return, whether it is food, clothing, or even a shelter from the wind!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults...just be willing to work "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and nodded. "When the time comes, there are more than tens of thousands of people, so... yes, as long as you are willing to work." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth suddenly felt that he seemed to understand something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few days, the three of them will go to the Central Square at noon. Wheat porridge, and more and more urban people who heard the news, almost occupied half of the square open space. Of course, some people are not coming for food. They just want to witness the end of the black street mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress is almost like a holiday every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the release of the porridge at noon, the other side of the square followed by the trial and execution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the woman in the white robe said... No mouse can escape their pursuit, Snake teeth see Kanash in the trial - He was pale and shivered on the platform, completely without the arrogance of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he was shattered in the roar of the iron pipe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to Kanash, there are many big people who have just heard of names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, bloody hands, such as iron crows, such as the open blade... are the fierce kings in Black Street. Their performance is not much better than Kanash. The death of every Rat King will raise people's warm cheers. In the end, the onlookers will sing the slogan of His Royal Highness and send the perpetrators to justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth day, the snake tooth once again saw Joe, he looked completely healthy, and the four excitedly embraced together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where have you been in these days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, Joe shook his head. "At the time, my head was confused. When I woke up, I was already lying in a tent. The head didn't hurt. The next step was to eat, sleep, and go back to burn... there are several The patient like me, who actually had dried meat in the porridge, I almost swallowed my tongue for the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Such a good thing?" Tiger claws blinked. "Hell, I want to get a cold epidemic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, you can survive, "Kwai Xin comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone sighed, Snakes suddenly said, "When the end of the evil month is over, I am looking for a job."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe those nobles are just fooling us, and there may be various additional requirements when they go," Tiger Claws, "You see the second army that has now begun to recruit." Soldiers and police officers are required to have a fixed address, and their life is innocent, they have not committed crimes, and even stealing is not allowed. They are not taken into consideration at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The snake tooth shook his head and did not answer. The things mentioned in the announcement are becoming a little bit more realistic. He realizes that the so-called new town of His Royal Highness may far exceed his own imagination. In this short and long period of time, he has gradually felt the change. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
