			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it’s dusk, it’s time for Vader to patrol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the time he will take two or three hands around a no-winter city, and occasionally one person will act - in theory he is now The police minister, the third-in-command of the Royal Security Agency, does not need to perform patrols in person, but he prefers to feel like he is sitting in the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a year and a half since I came to the city of the West. His biggest feeling is twofold. One is that the city is expanding at an alarming rate. It took him half a hour to get around the city, and now it’s at least twice as large, not including the harbour in the south and the farmland in the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that the law and order without the winter city can be described as incredible, the most common crimes are theft and fighting, and the most serious are these two. Crimes such as murder, robbery, kidnapping, etc., are hard to see once a month. It can't be said that there is no such thing. Especially after the influx of the refugees into the city, the law and order has deteriorated. However, with the concerted efforts of the police department and the witch alliance, the crime trend has been quickly curbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underlying emphasis on the case must be broken here is not a false statement. In the face of Axia’s ability to trace back and vanilla, any person who violates the law cannot Escape the sanctions. Because of the high risk of crime and cost, and zero tolerance for Black Street mice, security is almost an improvement that everyone can see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He insists on patrolling every day and wants to feel the calmness - looking at the way you look at the night with ease and the eyes that are full of trust when saluting him Vader always has an indescribable sense of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that you can be such a person - a respected law enforcer, not a villain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an experience that has never been seen in previous patrols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original intention of the two constructions is completely the same, the means and tasks are similar, but it creates a completely different effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the final analysis, it can only be said that the lord's talents are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, do you need me to follow?" When passing through the town hall, the whistle that just came back from the outside team greeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Don’t you have to accompany the girl today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...you I know," the whistle suddenly blushed. "Actually... don't have to stay together every night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has caused some observers. The sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you have to be careful, don't let people rob."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Closed, shut up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vad smiled and shook his head. "I will go alone today, you can go home first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... ok, thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the back of the whistle, He was quite emotional. When he left Jin Suicheng, he was alone. He also thought that this life would have passed like this. How could he expect to have this achievement today? Maybe after buying the neighboring house for Kakusim, he should find another person to accompany him. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just as Wid had just stepped out of the city hall, a sudden alarm sounded over the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“呜————————呜————————”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; His face suddenly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sound is completely different from the alarm used before, from dull to high-pitched, recurring, never ending, once heard, never forget - it represents There is no highest level of warning in the winter city, even in the long demon moon. In fact, he only did rehearsals in related exercises during the exercise, which was the first time he heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
