			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Capability... invalid?" The nightingale looked at Mai Mai with surprise. "Is she injured by a high-level devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...咕." Mai's voice is as small as a mosquito. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." She re-answered again, this time Everyone finally heard the words of Mai Hao. "I am a slap in the face..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Roland and the nightingale looked at each other and were in the eyes of each other. Seeing the incredible look, the two then asked almost unanimously, "What happened at the time? You can say it first and foremost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roland frowned deeply as he learned the whole thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A powerful devil that looks very similar to humans, even if it is far from the distance, it will feel strong fear, and the lightning is still at the speed of sound, still Being stared at by the other side? Compared to this information, the beasts and devils smashed into a group on the snowfield, and the news that the skeleton monsters can be used as weapons to attack is not so shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to wake up the lightning, Mai Hao took a sip on her chest before they let the two sides get out. Otherwise, if she continues to fly, she will soon fall into the enemy's arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the wound can’t heal because it’s because of McMug’s sake, no matter whether she has no such ability at all, even if she does, she certainly does not want to hurt herself. The closest partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a reason to find out from the lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but sigh a sigh of relief - before he left, he repeatedly licked each other, not taking advantage of new abilities Safe back is more important than anything else. As a result, she still couldn’t control the impulse. Probably this is the nature of the explorer’s inheritance in the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the moment, he can’t afford to blame lightning. The most urgent task is not to investigate the mistakes, but to find out where the problem lies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland asked the nightingale to call Wendy, Lily, Aisha, and the Sundial. In addition to conducting further inspections, they also planted symbiotic species to avoid An accident happened. A group of people were busy until the evening, lightning finally woke up from the slumber, and a comprehensive physical examination has also reached a preliminary conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean that her body is all right?" After listening to Ai Gesha’s report, Roland looked back and squinted and curled up in Wendy’s arms. A pale girl, "Why can't this be safe and sound?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The previous lethargy was caused by long hours of flight and physical exhaustion and exhaustion. As a result, the symbiotic species can also prove this - the Japanese did not feel any discomfort. This shows that her low state is caused by mental panic, not related to the body itself. In theory, it can be adjusted after a few days of rest. Come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the wound?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly what I picked up I want to say it," Ai Gesha whispered. "Her problem is in the magic. - When I checked with the balance magic stone, I felt a little feedback that didn't belong to her."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What...meaning?" Roland groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should know that magic is everywhere, but if you want to use it, you must first turn it into your own thing - this is what we often Condensation, whether it is a cyclone or a metaphysical figure after the advancement, belongs to this category. The devil is no exception, but the magic they possess is completely different from the witch, and it is reflected in the balance of the magic stone, just like clear water and The difference in rot." She paused for a moment, "and the kind of feedback I received was almost the same as the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suddenly felt something It’s tricky. “You mean, the devil has eroded the magic of lightning – without direct contact?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How is this possible?” Nightingale questioned "I can easily distinguish between different types of magic in the foggy world. If she is eroded, I should be able to see it at a glance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
