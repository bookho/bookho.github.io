			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he has to work harder. Roland shrugged in the dark and it was not a glorious thing to be shackled behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Chishui City has basically recovered its stability. Seventy percent of the aristocrats who have been screened decide to continue to operate the original industry, and the rest want to go to the city hall. Take a chance – although the basic requirement for applying for an administrative exam is “discussion and literacy” is not a problem for them, but Roland believes that the chances of this group of people passing the final review and becoming a formal official are not great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the nobility’s habits are not so easy to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, even being a clerical worker is much better than losing your head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are even three nobles who want to join the First Army - they are all knights, and there is no hidden meaning under the observation of the nightingale, but he still Upholding the decision made at the beginning of the army, he rejected the application of three people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving the problem of recycling and sequestration, the efficiency of Chishuicheng and surrounding areas is obviously much more efficient. In more than a week, there are more than 20,000. People boarded the ship to the winter city, and more people are still gathering in Chishui – the practice of giving up small towns and villages seems to make the controllable territory less, but actually the city hall The ability to control has increased dramatically. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this era of lack of roads, it is no different from idiots to want to let the government order go to the countryside. It is barely feasible to make up a set of leadership team in one year. It is hard for a strong person to blossom at the grassroots level. Barov also asked him why he insisted on transporting the population back to the winter city, instead of letting the business as usual after he unified the kingdom. He never answered it comprehensively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the City Hall manager can’t imagine how much a coal-iron composite industry can absorb, it’s hard to know how much energy and time it takes to build such an industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the most important point is that those remote territories don’t really work, and from a resource perspective, it’s a waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the population is concentrated in several major cities with convenient water transportation, which is more suitable for the status quo of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the moment of land reform, Roland has truly possessed the jurisdiction of the Chishui area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his next goal is naturally Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the giant city of Chishui, it’s much simpler to pack up the old king’s satellite city - it was originally an ordinary fief, and the surrounding number Ten seals around the kingdom were no different, until the first open-air silver mine was discovered, making its existence special. As more and more precious metal veins have been discovered, the area has become more and more lively, and the final change has become what it is today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that the output of Silverlight City is of great significance to the Grey Fort Coin, the latter lords are not only loyal to the Wimbledon The old man, William Earl, has been restricted in his power. In the past few decades, he has hardly sealed other nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, as long as the city owner expresses his position, Silver City is his bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the blood of Wimbledon III and the surviving highest-ranking heir, Roland believes that “convincing” the other party is not difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he is somewhat concerned that this city built on the veins is also the hometown of the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although every time I ask the other person, the answer is "I have been out of relationship with Ge Lanjia, so you don't have to worry about my thoughts", but he I always feel that the nightingale seems to be avoiding something. It was just a busy government that made Roland unable to take too much time on the guess and had to temporarily suppress it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth day after receiving the Axe Secret Letter, the First Army’s Eastern Army marched into the Silverlight City along the artificial canal. territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trip to Chishui City is almost the same, and Earl Williams led the team out of the city to meet, After the enthusiasm, it was a dinner invitation. The difference is that the welcome team of Chishui City is divided into aristocrats, while the old city's team has many more businessmen, and even the old acquaintance Hogg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hogg’s needle-punching line turned the welcome banquet into a business meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not asking me how the machine in the mine is working?" He was smug in front of a group of businessmen, "Now it The real inventor is standing in front of you - it is this Roland! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. You don't have to go to the West, you can get the answer directly in Silver City!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchants immediately swarmed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Respected, can you tell us why its strength is so big?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't know if you are willing to sell more track systems. The Diamond Chamber of Commerce is looking forward to cooperating with No Winter City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, you still Remember the fast sailing? Two years ago, I provided you with several sailing boats to transport the refugees in the east. In terms of trade strength, we are definitely one of the best chambers in the central region. If you can, the fast sail will hope to buy one. The whole set of steam engine manufacturing equipment. Of course, the price is absolutely excellent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the "good news" that the businesswoman Margaret had revealed to herself, Roland couldn't help but laugh and cry - - "Hogg will travel to the West with a large number of merchants." I did not expect that I was in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the rest of the Grey Fort is like Silver City, how wonderful the world is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy to satisfy the curiosity of the merchants, he finally found the opportunity to be alone with the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked through the hall and walked on the terrace of the evening breeze, temporarily segregating the banquet of the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stood behind the wine glass and overlooked the city under the night, and then he said, "You will hand over the right to divide the seal. You don't feel sorry at all." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't really have it, but what about regret..." Earl William smiled. "Your father, and you." Father’s father, although not stated, will never allow Silver City to have a group of his own, and the family training of the William family will never be separated, so it is not as important to me as you think. "He's a little bit, "Not to mention, I don't need this power either."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No?" Roland couldn't help but be curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The idea is to expand and consolidate your power to prevent others from peeing, and Silver City does not have this risk - any idea of ​​playing this city The people are no different from the open authority to provoke the authority of the Wimbledon royal family. Therefore, as long as the family guarantees loyalty, there is no need to worry about being invaded.” The count sipped his mouth. “In turn, the seal is in a sense, it is also for itself. A kind of weakening - it divides the resources that belong to oneself into others in exchange for the effectiveness of the latter. I prefer to put these resources in person's hands, I hope to run it in person. You know the last two decades How much has the output of Silver City increased?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fulfilled sixteen times, for which I invested most of my energy..." The old city owner was so excited, "At first it was just an open-pit silver mine, now There are more than ten kinds of veins excavated. At the same time, there were only collection teams sent by the royal family. At present, there are not only various kinds of ore, jewelers, but also many auxiliary industries developed through mining, such as oil lamps, mine manufacturing, etc. Your steam engine can also be counted as one of them. Am I not wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true," Roland smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This feeling is like cultivating a child, watching it grow up gradually, how do you say that I am willing to cut it and seal it to others? So I don't need this power.” The count said that he had a sigh of relief. “Your Majesty, would you like me to continue to operate this city that shines in silver?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, if you like," he raised the glass to the other party, and the two smiled, then the cups touched together and made a crisp sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," Roland changed his drink after drinking a drink. "Do you know what Gelan's family is doing?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
