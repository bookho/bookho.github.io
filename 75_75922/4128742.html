			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the gray castle...! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo couldn’t help but make a difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who jumped from the unseen border lord to the gray-browed power in just a few years, whose reputation is unknown in the church, no People don't know. No intelligence can explain why he was able to rise so quickly, even in the holy city of Hermes, where he began to unify the mainland, and lost in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorenzo can make a decision so quickly, resolutely breaking with the church, largely because of Roland Wimbledon - in him In the eyes, the church and the gray fort have already established a revenge of the world. If the bishop is still living, it is possible to suffer the catastrophe at any time. Now, when will you not take off this robes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the other party has just stepped into the throne, and the attention should be in their own territory. Now they suddenly intervene in the border between the morning and the wolf, and they are still making a big effort. As everyone knows, its purpose is very worthwhile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure?" Earl looked at Hagrid, "Details to listen to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The credibility of this news is absolutely no problem, or it has been verified by many parties," the latter vowed. "The people who are stationed at the foot of the cage are from the gray castle. Their costumes and dresses are exactly the same. It was the school of the eccentric army. Secondly, the death squad was received all over the morning, not only the gathering place was the cage mountain area, but also some people said that they were the king of the gray castle!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cage Hill... Death Row..." Lorenzo took two steps back and forth, and suddenly his eyes flashed. "Don't he come for that thing--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe, adults," Hagrid nodded. "No...should be said, it must be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "How can he know about this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He knows that it’s not surprising that the people who discovered the ruins only rely on the point I have always thought that those ruins are not isolated, they may have some kind of connection before - and Roland just happened to be in front of everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although the church did not know exactly why the four princes of Graysburg had risen until the demise, there were several arguments circulating inside. Aside from the nonsense of the incarnation of the gods, the spokesperson of the devil, and so on, there is a lot of explanation for the believers: that is, he has gained inheritance from a certain relic, and has mastered the incredible power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though the three bishops dismissed this statement, many believers believe that this is the truth of the matter, and Lorenzo is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the other party above the holy city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most incredible relic is the curse of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the gods punished the army to swept the entire wolf kingdom with thunder, the wolf aristocracy either died or surrendered, even if the water queen and the wolf king joined hands Can stop the attack of the church. As the former Bishop of Dagong Island, he participated in most of the logistics and sweeping work, sending the looted materials to the front line or unified storage. In a search for the cliff, he happened to know the legend of this hundred years ago-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to legend, a group of villagers stole from the cursed temple in Cangshan Brought a group of treasures, and then died, the treasures also fell into the hands of local aristocrats. The ancestors of the Count of the Great Wall Ridge were very interested in this. They thought that it was not a curse that triggered this, but it was related to the things brought out by the batch. Therefore, after spending some means and energy, some of the treasures were purchased from Chenxi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some research, plus the cost of more than a dozen lives, the old count did find a different artifact - it looks unremarkable But it can produce deadly light, the effect is very similar to the curse, it is a kind of weapon that kills invisible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not used a few times, it’s no longer responding, just like a lot of power, it’s a dead thing. Although the old count sent people to the border to explore, and even ventured into the temple personally, he never found a way to restore it. So he wrote this past story into his family history, hoping that future generations could find the answer, and that strange thing was preserved as a heirloom, until it was overcome by the church after more than a hundred years, and it changed hands again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
