			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final exam is coming soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches are sitting in the hall and waiting for the teacher to issue the test paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia elegantly took care of her nails with a knife, and my mind had already floated to dinner - according to His Royal Highness, after today’s exam, The first phase of the school will come to an end. To celebrate, everyone can get an ice cream bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that she can eat more than one serving of bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, when she has time, she will fight the landlord with the ashes and the veils. This kind of game that requires certain strategies and skills has been popular with the upper aristocrats. There are some similarities in the beasts, and they all pay attention to the strengths and avoid weaknesses. Compared to this, she admits that she does not lose the adult, and the ashes are even more important, and the facts prove this. Now she has received six ice cream bread owed in her hands, four of which are from ashes and two from veils. In other words, as long as the Highness arranges this delicious dessert in the dessert, the two have to hand it over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is obviously a good day for a good harvest. When dinner, she will be able to enjoy three ice cream breads, and I can eat it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the exam, Adriana naturally has a good foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since she knew that there was such a thing, she asked Sylvie about the last test and did it again according to the topic. As a result, she found that the test was very simple, probably similar to the aristocratic enlightenment. Mainly in literacy, some so-called arithmetic knowledge is also the simplest calculation of profit and loss, not as good as the management of the account, not to mention the family's financial and trade calculations. In this case, she is a recognized genius in the family. She was able to check the books at the age of fifteen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make everything the best, this is the style of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test paper was sent out very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of three questionnaires, Andrea quickly swept up and looked up, three sheets of text written in the kingdom language test, basic arithmetic and elementary nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good, exactly the same as last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can't help but raise her mouth, first spread the kingdom language test volume, and then write the goose pen directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With only a quarter of an hour, she answered the question on paper. Although the vocabulary range is wider than last time, there are several more eccentric examination methods, such as “reading comprehension” and “clogging”, but these are hard to beat her. It’s not that after reading the content, answering the questions and completing the sentences, it’s a mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is basic arithmetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front is still a simple profit and loss calculation, but gradually, Andrea's speed slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? The lines intersecting the two crosses plus the above points, using equations to describe it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart is so tight, the feeling of looking at the "Theory of Natural Science Theory" is once again in my heart, why do I know each word and connect But don't know what it means? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of the next few questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia felt sweat on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath, held her breath, and turned her head to look at the nightingale in the back row - the same aristocrat, can she give herself a hint? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the other’s expression made her suddenly cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw the nightingale looking at the paper with a stagnation, the quill was on my lips, and my eyes had not moved for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it difficult to make this problem too difficult? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly is not coming to take the test, the legendary talented Miss Anna is also missing, and the people around are still competing with the first page, no Law reference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
