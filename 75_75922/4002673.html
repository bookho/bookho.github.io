			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refining hall in Dongcheng District is the favorite place in Lightning Weekday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentices and disciples carry the required materials back and forth, the hot air in the utensils, the sulphur and sour taste that are lingering in the room, and The cracking sound of the glass bottle that occasionally rings and the curse of the alchemist are always full of life. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he was promoted to one of the three chiefs two years ago and has his own independent alchemy room, it is easier to crowd the chaotic halls. Let him inspire. Alchemy is like this busy scene. When all kinds of materials are blended together, most of them will become more turbid. Only a small part will stand out, and the brilliance will bloom. Crystal glass is the same, and so does the strong snow powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After burning, melting, mixing, no one knows that grayish white sand and dark charcoal can be transformed into such a wonderful thing, this is the charm of alchemy . People are no exception. Every year, a large number of new apprentices join the Alchemy Association, but in the end only a few can fade away from the rough and dull appearance, becoming the shining pearl in the association. Lightning is one of them. It took him thirty-four years from the apprenticeship to the chief. Now that he is close to fifty, he is about to reach the end of his life. But he can understand the beauty of the study of the sage, and he feels that this life has been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that what happened to Wang’s recent days has made Lightning feel a little uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest change is the replacement of the throne... After the four princes will be hanged, they have become an unquestioned successor. This has nothing to do with the Alchemy Association. No matter who the King is, they are only responsible for providing alchemy products. But when the strong snow powder was handed over to Tefco as a war material, can they still stay out of the way as usual? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the king has gradually returned to calm, the four princes have not come to visit the alchemy association, but instead went to the astrology, which seems to be a bad sign. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still thinking about astrology?" Someone suddenly said, "The old wrinkled a bitter face and stared at the window, this is not like You are usually."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being polite and talking to yourself, it must be a chief. He turned his head and looked at the same white-haired Rayleigh. "You said... What is the idea of ​​the four princes in the end?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The guy who stares at the stars all day is wasting money, but What do you mean," Rayleigh didn't think. "It's a pity that he didn't insist on his own opinion. The gang is not worthy of the name of the sage. It should have been demobilized."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the two great schools, the Alchemy Association has its own eyeliner in the Guanxingjia Association. It is a bit of a glimpse of Roland’s goal of going to the astrology, but it is not clear that the chief astrologer and the four princes In the end, he talked about what happened, and finally let him dispel the idea of ​​closing the astrology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, are you worried that the Alchemy Association will fall to this point?" He patted Lightning's shoulder hard. "Don't forget our products." How much profit can you bring to Wangdu? Crystal glass and perfume only need to let go of production restrictions. If the golden dragon earned in one or two years is enough to fill the prince's bedroom, will he be willing to close the association?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the association is extracting strong snow powder for Tefko..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How then, can we violate the king's orders?" "Rayleigh sneered at it. "If he had some common sense in his head, he wouldn't use this excuse to blame us. Besides, he also has a lot of snow powder weapons. Isn't it a formula obtained from the traitor Boer? The attack on Wang Du can also be regarded as the merit of our alchemy association. Maybe we will give him a better mix of formulas and get rewards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I hope so," Lighten nodded, and his heart was a little relieved. As Ruili said, the Alchemy Association is, after all, a big gold producer. His Royal Highness has not been able to come for the first time, and may have been entangled in trivial matters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was going to give instructions to the remaining alchemists, a disciple rushed into the hall and shouted at him, "First, Chief adult, hey, squat down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Where is he?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Lightning exclaimed, the noise in the hall was quiet and the eyes of everyone came to the comers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
