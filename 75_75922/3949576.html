			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combat experience accumulated over the years has played a role, and the body has already reacted before the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She subconsciously leans back, silver light sticks across her cheeks, and even in the fog, she can feel the power of this light— - Hot and violent, not something that can be possessed by anything. After avoiding the sudden attack, the night slammed on the ground and pulled away from the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened, what happened to the saints?" Rosad asked in panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that a mouse sneaked in," the witch licked her lips. "You find a safe place to be good, be careful not to be affected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean...there are witches here?" The priest looked changed. "I am going to call the trial warrior!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, I haven’t had a witch hunting for a long time. It’s rare to meet such an opportunity. How can I give it to others? You just have to wait and watch it.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two spoke, the nightingale was also looking at the woman, known as the ambassador, although she knew that the church was likely to secretly raise the witch, but when this is confirmed She still feels very sad. The witch has become a part of the church, and may even be at the top. From the other's words, she can be heard that she is interested in hunting witches and does not treat herself as a similar one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale couldn’t help but think of the raider who met at the dock on the outskirts of Wangdu, and he did not hesitate when he stabbed the short sword into Wendy’s body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people can no longer be regarded as the same kind, they have embarked on a very different path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, she no longer hesitates to pull out the revolver at the waist - even if she doesn't like this fight anymore, she has no choice, sometimes Only killing can stop the killing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where are you from?” The Holy See turned his head and looked at the position where the nightingale stood. “The priest cannot see you, indicating that your ability can hide itself; Being able to avoid my attacks means having to undergo combat training or have experienced hundreds of battles in person. No matter which one, it is very valuable for the wild witches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where am I from, what does it have to do with you," said the nightingale. She noticed that the other party's face was tied with a ribbon that completely obscured both eyes. This is what the blind man would do. The "silver whip" in the hands of the Holy Ghost did not disappear, still entrenched on her side, and the sharp end was like a rising snake head, swaying against himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fog, only the magic has color, is she relying on this strange whip to determine her position? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are some things you may not know yet. The church has crowned a new pope. He is tolerant and compassionate. He believes that wild witches also have the value of being redeemed. If you are willing to be loyal to the gods, the church can wash away your sins and accept you as a pure person." The Holy Spirit raised his chest. "This is a golden opportunity for you. If you are not here alone, you will get to know each other. Other fallen witch companions can take them to the holy city of Hermes to welcome their new students."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it sounds good, "The night sneer sneered twice. "But after awakening as a witch, there is really a so-called sin. If you have a way to remove it, why do you set this rule now, instead of saving those lost sisters from the beginning? You are three. Older children, have never seen a shameless lie?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath and said in a word, "I, not guilty!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak this sentence When, out of the fog Nightingale, Pulled my trigger, barrel blooming flame, issued thunderous roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Silver Whip" instantly moved, only to see the light belt rising upwards, blocking the front of the Holy Spirit, suddenly overflowing the ignition star. Then the whip head stretched out and threw a small piece of distorted metal onto the ground—the bullet that was shot by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stuff can actually block the musket! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
