			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, Roland’s heart is moving, how does this sound like a giant evil beast that is active near the Snowy Mountains? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Similar to the wild beast?" Before he asked for an exit, Ai Gesha had already said first, "Is it into the Devil's Camp, and you are engulfing the Blackrock Spire?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil... Camp?" Pasha’s tone was somewhat confusing. "In addition to repairing the remains and opening up the channel of the Glow, we did not let the worms go." Other places - after all, it consumes too much food, we can hardly afford it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland roughly explained the witches in the fascinating forest The vision that was met with the west of the West, and the book took the image of the giant beast drawn by Soroya. "The traces of these two monsters all point to a huge snow-capped mountain, which is much larger than the wild beast." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s true that the worm is swallowed," Pasha took a deep breath after reading the vivid "photograph". "I am afraid that the snow mountain you said is also Remains of the remains of an underground civilization! It is said in the literature that they have spread throughout the entire territory, but wherever there are mountains It has left the footprint of the worm. This can be seen from the inside of the riddled mountains. This record is not an exaggeration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you I believe that the underground civilization has completely disappeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the worm is just the body, the same way as the original carrier, as long as you transfer a soul, you can manipulate It acts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Roland is sinking. He looked around and found the witches in the room to look serious. Obviously, everyone thought of one place - the worm was dispatched twice, once for the research tower of Ai Gesha, once for the devil camp, and after eliminating the three forces, the only possibility left was the race that had not appeared. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does they discover the remains of the snow-capped mountains and attach them to the worm's body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, it’s only a small matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's follow this line of thought, what if there is a magic core and a central carrier in the snow mountain ruins? Will the other party significantly increase the level of magic theory and create a sacred instrument for witches? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, according to the literature, the more magnificent the mountains, the more the cities built by the underground civilization are likely to be larger... The snow mountains are not as cool as the Desperate and Longji Mountains. The undulations are thousands of miles, but the main peak is the highest in this area. If there is a lot of body there, he can't leave it alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, please help us explore this snowy mountain!" said Celine suddenly and eagerly, "If there is a good instrument stored there..." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are also various types of carriers mentioned in the literature - if they fall into the hands of the enemy, I am afraid it will cause us a lot of trouble." Although the sound still sounds calm, from the perspective of the fast-jittering tentacles, her inner fluctuations are not as low as the competition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there was a noisy discussion behind the sarcoma. Obviously this news caused an uproar among the remnants of Takula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland quickly understood why they were thrilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carrier is completely out of the human form, but it is much better in this respect than the unconscious god punishment body. At least it can feel cold and sore. , also has a certain sense of smell. Being locked up in a void cage for hundreds of years, it's no wonder that they are also so concerned about the news of the new carrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your worries really make sense," he pretended to be indulged. "I have been planning to explore the snowy mountains of the West, but I lack effective means of transportation. I don't want the witch to take risks, so I have to delay it. If there is a combination of swallowing worms, it is a good opportunity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will start the migration as soon as possible ," Pasha solemnly responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before discussing the way of cooperation, I didn’t expect the opportunity to be delivered to the door so soon. In fact, even without the pleading of the other party, Roland will investigate the interior of the Snow Mountain. In addition to the need to rule out threats that may not exist near the Winter City, he is also interested in this kind of carrier that can easily open large-scale tunnels on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
