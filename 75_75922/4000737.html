			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Calvin Kant brought the Northern Territories to the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquet hall is burning with a blazing fire, and everyone’s figure is reflected on the wall, and the flame swinging posture makes the shadow dance up and down, like the same weird Mural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four long tables in the hall are filled with steaming meat and drinks, which looks like a sumptuous dinner, just on-site The atmosphere was not easy, especially after the Duke said that the king had been conquered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have sent people to recover the team that set off four days ago. If they are lucky, they will be able to come back alive," he said as he sat in the main seat. "The key is that we... what should we do in the North?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles face each other, probably the news that Tiffco did not hold for a day. No one dared to answer the hall in one time. Calvin saw timidity and remorse in the eyes of many small nobles. Itis was right. It is absolutely impossible for such a person to resist Roland Wimbledon. The choice of cracking the earth is not from the beginning. They actually have only one way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for the nobility who had just turned to Tefko, it was a bit embarrassing to turn to the reverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or, do we send messengers to explore the prince's tone?" It took a while for someone to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he does not interfere with the North, we will simply support him as a king," and the words immediately got the approval of another little aristocrat. "In any case, it is Wimbledon's own thing, who is the same as the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Lista sneered out, "all the same?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calvin picked up his eyebrows and focused on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Earl’s speech, everyone’s voice was low, which made him quite uncomfortable. In fact, the three forces themselves did not have much difference. The Kant family even had to go a little worse... but he followed his daughter’s idea and first showed it to Tiefco before he got the position of the duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he also understands that this is one of the new king’s checks and balances – the other two are contemptuous and dissatisfied with themselves, and Tiffco is probably happy to see it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you forget the Duke of Ace who was executed on the basis of conviction?" Lista said coldly. "He didn't take the initiative to provoke." Tefco. If we are soft at the beginning, the noose will be placed around our neck at any time, then it will be too late to struggle! In the eyes of the four princes, we are really involved in the opposite, at least everyone and Tiffco can't get away with it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you be soft and how can you even have a king for one day, we are just an egg hitting a stone..." A vassal of Calvin whispered in accordance with the agreed content, and it seemed that the momentum was worse. In the other person's glare, the latter half of the sentence is even more inaudible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’ll try it, whether it’s an egg or not,” Ed Hoss screamed. “The rebel killed my brother! He "The price will be paid for this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the egg? Maybe the north is ups and downs, there are dangerous roads everywhere, his army can be in the plains. It is not necessarily able to eat in the north, but the Earl of Hoss keeps up. "The big horse family retreats into the cold wind, I don't believe his army can fly up."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the same as exposing the back to the church. Calvin conceived that the gangs were equally unwilling to the North. He also heard about the parents of Howth, and it seems to have died in a battle against the lords of the West... But how can he not die? If the screaming can make the other party pay the price, the Knight's sword armor does not need to exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice in the hall gradually became noisy, and because of the attitudes of Lista and Howth, the voice of "staying in the air and preparing for the attack" was slow. Slowly overwhelmed the party who "proactively inquired about the situation of the four princes." Although Calvin has been silent, but his heart is anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis will not have any trouble? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
