			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the devil lord, the power of the Scorpio Lord is indeed amazing, and the space channel opened by magic can be used for both rapid maneuvering and as a shield or weapon. Use, but as long as you analyze it carefully, you will find that it is not without flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first thing you can confirm is that this high-end devil can only open one channel at a time, and the entrance side is within reach." Tis said, "The extreme distance on the other side is not well determined, but it can reach at least two kilometers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like an enhancement of trajectory ability. Edition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time with Roland, Ai Gesha also learned a lot of strange words from the other side, such as "enhanced version", " Special enhanced version, "enhanced enhanced version", etc....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s true that the distance is only a single look," Northland Pearl nodded, "but the path created by the trajectory The amount depends on the amount of magic, and the Lord of Scorpio must open the new channel after closing the previous channel. The situation at the time was extremely urgent for it, and it is unlikely that it would hide one. This is very important, it determines us. Basic response – if the other party can use multiple channels simultaneously, then the situation It’s a hundred times more complicated.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two digested, she went on to say, “The other key point is that although the entrance and exit of the passage can be freely scaled, Heck Zod must stand near the door to maintain its existence. According to Ms. Hilvey, when the explosion on the Dagong Island occurred, it took several seconds to close the gate before it flew to the south of the island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This shows that...the bigger the door is, the slower it is to close it?" The iron axe thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is probably the case." Itisus applauded, "and the last point is its fatal wounded - Heckzod is not a demon, It is impossible to restrain the action of the witch, and it is difficult to pose a sufficient threat to the person wearing the stone of the gods. Although its body is not weaker than the extraordinary, the close-up killing will make himself trapped in the field of forbidden magic. I think It will never be willing to use its own life to exchange two or three humans in the district."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of her here, she paused, "Sum up, the Lord of Scorpio The main ability is to develop a two-way channel centered on it and radius of several kilometers, and only one channel is allowed at a time. Whether it is the head or the tail, as long as the sides of the door are affected by the stone, the channel will collapse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So if it reappears, our response is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is in position The outer edge, and the exit side of the door does not face the position, let Miss Hilli directly guide the gunfire to cover. Itis is in an orderly manner. "If the exit side of the door is in the position, or if it directly uses the small door to quickly rush into the first position, then the soldiers do nothing and hand it over to the professionals." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do nothing?" The iron axe was slightly stunned, and then suddenly stunned, "...the original."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Itis smiled. "In fact, the most effective way of attacking the Scorpio Lord is to use our firearms to kill ourselves. Once the soldiers can hold their hands, it will face the position. The threat is limited – as I said before, this ability is almost irreplaceable for strategic assignments, but it is not a good choice to attack.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the face of the first military line that ignores it, the devil lord can never rush into the ditch and the soldiers are close to killing, so that when the professional - the sacred witch of the squad is on the scene, it will only die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the other party uses the gap of the shelling to counterattack?" Ai Gesha asked after a moment of indulgence, "For example, it opens a passage connecting the outside, let us Mistaken to believe that it is transporting troops, but after opening the gun, open a new door, and point the exit side to the position, so that we may suffer from the gunfire coming to our own side."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Being able to think of this is enough to prove that the Ice Witch has done a lot of work on the new weapons of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is indeed a theoretically feasible method, but I don’t think the Scorpio Lord will do that." Itis explained, "For singles." The door can be completed in a blink of an eye, but it takes time to expand to a giant door that can completely protect itself. The time difference between the two is extremely limited, and once it fails, the end is the bomb that is left behind. Broken. For Dajun, this is too risky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
