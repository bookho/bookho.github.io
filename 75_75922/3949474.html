			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time Garcia saw the horror of the extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her weapon is obviously an ordinary one-handed sword, but it’s bursting with the pressure of the soul, and every hit on the shield As heavy as a giant sword, after two or three times, Garcia's arm could no longer be lifted, and then the chin was smashed by a blow from bottom to top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After recovering, the Queen of Waters completely gave up the defense, and in the turn of the room, a bed squat appeared in front of her. She pulled the trigger and shot not the iron spear, but a few cans of black water. Jieluo swayed the sword and fell down on the crock, but it was covered with black water. The evil fire crystals soaked in the jar are in contact with the air, and quickly smoke and burn, turning the pure person into a pillar of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next move will not work, the other party uses the speed of the ordinary people to move around the flower pool, and the bed can not be transferred, Garcia I have to rely on rising stone walls and staggered iron railings to stop the actions of the pures, turning the flowers placed in the garden into explosives filled with snow powder, sometimes the ground suddenly sinks and becomes fatal. The trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After killing the other party several times, Garcia found that his breathing gradually became heavy, and the sweat of the beans fell from his forehead and hit his head. The stuns almost made her unable to stand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job," the reborn Jiro did not attack, but patted the palm of his hand. "You can do this step is beyond my expectation." But forgot to tell you, although in this world, you can change the environment and the venue with your own consciousness, but it consumes far more energy than the creation of the sky... even with the rebirth. You should be able to feel the body. Weakness and exhaustion, maybe the next death is a complete sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"H, that’s better than necking,” Garcia gasped. To breathe, "And you seem to have forgotten the screams that have just been burned by evil fires. How many times have you died in this round? Three times, or four times? I don't think you will stick to it longer than me." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Jielu was silent for a moment before he said, "Since I became a pure person, the church has made a lot of preparations for me, from knowledge and learning to fight. Skills, to feed the judges to improve my abilities. Those who judge the warriors know that they will Animals can still enter the soul battlefield. In the world of consciousness, they temper my skills in a desperate struggle, then accept death with peace of mind, and pass on their own sentiments and experiences to me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia did not interrupt her, maybe the other party is delaying time, but I do need to take a break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also engulfed an extraordinary person, her power is daunting - I almost lost in the battle of the soul, but in the end, I rely on the devil The weapon defeated her and got everything for her. Because of the different nature of the magic, I can't really transform into an extraordinary person, or the ability to engulf other witches, but in the world of consciousness, these are not difficult. Next is very Few people can threaten me. In the past two hundred years, the number of people I swallowed has not even been clear to myself. Any pain, joy, sadness, and joy in this world can be experienced by myself..." The meal, "including death is also true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to say?" Garcia frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and my gap," Jielu calmly replied, "The superposition of many souls makes my will extremely powerful. If measured by the number of deaths, I think I can bear at least hundreds of deaths."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will help you to verify it." She sneered twice, but her heart sank. ... The other person's demeanor is not like bluffing. When the dock is clean and killing the guards, it can be seen that the pure people do have combat skills that do not match the age. If that's the case, you have to have more powerful weapons... Hurry and think, is there anything that can easily kill an experienced extraordinary witch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Battle of Souls is not a contest of imagination," Jessie sees through her thoughts. "You can't make yourself invulnerable." It is also impossible to summon the weapons of the ancient legends that destroyed the earth... You can’t create things that you haven’t experienced, and what you see and know is the key to determining the outcome.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will make the whole garden full of strong snow powder, so you can't avoid it," Garcia said coldly. "Even if you die, you can at least drag you together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
