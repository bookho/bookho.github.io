			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubaca. When the blood whip just got up from the bed, he heard the news of the small oasis in the northwest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it?" He frowned, although he saw the oasis ignited last night, but did not expect the roaring clan to insist on one night. Not down. Has there been a new clan with such strong strength in Yinchuan recently? Why didn't he have any impression? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lumbara patted the pet lying next to her, letting her wrap up in the blanket, and then looking at her hand, "talk carefully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, according to the guys who escaped, the oasis' fire was not the sneak of the challenger, but the god's skyfire-"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far!" He vomited. "This group of cowards, when they encounter something that can’t be solved, they are pushed to the Three Gods. I want to hang them all in Tiesha City. "The doorway!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Hesitated for a moment. "My man went to the small oasis camp this morning and found that the scene there is indeed It is quite similar to what they describe... There are many dark pits on the ground, and the bodies and houses are scattered everywhere, not like a simple arson."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s like a huge sand worm or a shovel running over the camp and putting them Tear seven thousand Falling down." The men used the words. "People who stayed in the camp mostly fell down, but the guys who were having fun outside organized a counterattack, but... they didn't even see the opponent, they were defeated. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, the ambush in the group of idiots, and then fled to the opponent without approaching the opponent?" Rubaka began to wonder if he was right. The dog is too kind, and it takes a lot of effort to draw them together. The result is only this degree? Or is it that the long-term stability of life is more serious than the one he expected? "And then? So far, they still don't know which clan is occupying a small oasis?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My people are asking, it should be soon I can get the news," said the man, and he was hesitant. "It’s just that some fugitives said that they saw many northerners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Northerners..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news made Rubaka serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked naked to the window, looking at the northwest, the fire had already been extinguished, leaving only a few faintly visible black smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the roaring clan is a watchdog that is pulled by the iron whip and the bone-cutting, he is not too concerned about the other's life and death. The challenger system is not so much a qualification test, but rather a protection wall set up by the six clan for himself. This principle was not understood until he entered Tiesha City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred duel is only a small-scale fight, and the challenger competes for a small oasis but is a full-scale war between the two clan. Even if you kill the blood on both sides, it is not a rare thing. After all, even if you don't enter the Iron Sands City, the Oasis is the battleground for each clan to seek to grow. No matter which side wins, it usually pays a very heavy price, and it takes a long time to lick the wound. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the big clan is not threatening to turn the challenger into a watchdog as long as it is threatened, especially if the compromise is only temporary, etc. The clan, who will launch the duel sooner or later, will not be able to ring the bell of Tiesha City until the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there will be new challengers at that time, the watchdog will be swept out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the Da Clan has always maintained that it will not fall into the predicament of injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron whip has now climbed to the fourth position, even if the challenger immediately launches a duel, it is estimated that he will not find him, so the small oasis is not a big deal Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the northerners are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the former Queen of the Waters has caused a lot of confusion to the Iron Sands City - even if it is actually a slave and a beater, many people will yearn for it. The piece of evergreen land in the north. The two potential challengers' rushing out made the small oasis empty, which led the followers to easily launch the sacred challenge. It was also in the chaos that Lubaka seized the opportunity and successfully became the fourth big clan. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go staring at the gang and make things clear." He turned to his opponent and told him, "How many people from the city, how many weapons, what to pay attention to - I have to know!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, patriarch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, he should have a good discussion with other big clan Something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules of the extreme south, never allow outsiders to intervene! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, his men brought back a Lubaka. Blood Whip the unbelievable news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say? Aosha clan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They really claimed this, The flag in the oasis has been replaced by the battle pattern of Aosha. I also saw the Principal of Aosa, who was sold as a slave! She has become a goddess, and is calling a new ethnic group. The respondents seem to have quite a lot! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...how is it possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubaka is not ignorant of the northern kingdom, and the goddess is completely regarded as evil in the eyes of the Grey Fortress, if the end of the Shamin slaves is counted Tough enough, then a goddess slave will not have the slightest possible turnaround. But now, how did she win the support of the northerners, and in turn took them back to the extreme south with the attitude of the Avengers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt an indescribable absurdity and a faint panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mojin people have been suppressed in the desert, not because they like the desert, but because they can not always compete with the gray castle. If the other party wants to be unfavorable to the iron sand city, each clan may unite against the outsiders. But if the Aosha clan, who has received the support of the northerners, is only targeting one family, will other clan be closely connected with the iron whip? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is almost a question that does not need to be answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slammed the glass on the table to the ground and slammed it on the ground to make it a crystal crumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to pass the sacred duel to report the murder of the father of the year, let's come! Rubaka thought badly that the northerners may have excellent weapons and a large number of people, but in the duel, Mo Jinsha is the most brave warrior! I will let you know what is called the taste of despair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, another man entered his hall. "The patriarch, the Aosha clan sent a gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Lubaka felt his head daring, "Gift?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes Just put it in the garden outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me to see," he gnashed his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a huge wooden box, about one person long, half a person wide, It is like a splicing of several ordinary wooden boards. The four corner nails have nails, and the appearance does not see any abnormalities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the people who sent it?" Lubaka asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"has gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...only one person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One person?" He picked a brow and kicked it forward. With one foot in the box, the wooden box rolled over a few laps and made a crash of jingle - it seemed to contain other things. Just according to this weight, it is almost equivalent to hollow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a broken limb and flesh, or a peeled human skin? In addition to intimidation and bluffing, he couldn't think of what the other party would send. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
