			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xie Shifu suddenly smiled, only the woman around her sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland naturally noticed this scene. Since the dream world has repeatedly absorbed those core cyclones, his power has also grown, and his perception and acumen have increased. Going to a new stage. Although the other party was very covert, it was still captured by the corners of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman is the finance and secretary of Guardian. I heard that it’s not long before I graduated from a prestigious school. The talents and abilities are upper and upper. It’s quite good, it’s a kind of person who wins at the starting line. Only the whole factory knows that all the expenses are currently borne by the Sanye Group. The “current boss” is basically incompetent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably in the eyes of the youngsters, his actions are all in the group's wool, digging the employer's corner, and the look is not very good-looking and understandable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland doesn't care. In this case, as long as the other party is also pulled into the water, a bit of complaint will inevitably vanish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, there is everyone’s credit for such a quick result," he smiled at the secretary. "If you succeed, the employees in the factory will have a good monthly salary." "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, or the boss, you want to be thoughtful," Master Xie nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...I don't mean this..." Qingyi didn't expect his little gesture to be noticed by Roland, and he couldn't help but swear. "I just I wonder, when will the company's books be profitable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No surprise, it should never be a day. Roland quietly waved his hand. "Reassured, my friends are all people who pursue dreams. Making money is not a problem at all. You are waiting for a promotion and a raise."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good to say, let's say." Master Xie seems to have fallen into the illusion of climbing the peak of life, laughing and gathering the folds on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," he looked at, "I just have a new project to develop, you and I go to the office."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...boss," Just as Roland turned to leave, Master Xie asked with a good look, "Do you have any other requirements for this tractor? Such as styling, color, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You really use it as a movie prop... Roland shook his head with a funny smile, "As long as the reliability is passed, Nothing else is important. But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can If you want, the final product can have five pairs of heavy wheels."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not a problem at all," Master Xie patted his chest. "I am designing a site." When you consider scalability, you can give it to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Because the factory employees ran out to watch the test car test Factory where looks fairly quiet. Roland noticed that after crossing the workshop door, the distance that the green dragonfly would follow was relaxed from two meters to five meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t help but laugh a little. It seems that Guardian did not reveal his identity to the other party, otherwise she should know that when a martial artist wants to plot a misconduct, don’t Said five meters, first let her run 50 meters is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is too lazy to improve his image in the eyes of employees, he can do it for him, nothing else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the messy office, Roland sat directly at the boss and opened the door to see the mountain. "Yes, I have a friend..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is coming again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green can't help but lap. What projects start with a friend, the question is how many friends who are willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy a pile of garbage. She admits that the wealthy people's hobbies are indeed very strange, but the boss's dress is not like which of the noble sons, this eyesight she is still confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
