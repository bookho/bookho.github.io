			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving the morning affairs, Roland returned to his home, a manor in the depths of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should have belonged to a wealthy businessman, not only with several two-storey stone houses, but also around the large vestibule backyard. Only the turmoil of Hermes made the original owner unknown, and he also used this as a temporary place to settle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the middle of the main house, Anna is sitting at the table, carefully reading the books he has found from the dream world. The sun shone from the window, reflecting her bangs into a beautiful golden yellow, while leaving a light edge on her white face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the meeting is over?" Hearing the noise, she turned her head and asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, everything to say is said, Nana, they have to leave early tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, let's talk about it," Anna got up and took a basin of water, put it on the low stool next to the bed, then leaned over to help him take off his shoes. The leather boots used in the plateau of this era are hard and not very breathable, so every time you go back to the bedroom, the first thing he has to do is to relax his feet and then put on a pair of lightweight soft-soled shoes. At first, Roland insisted on coming, but ultimately failed to resist the other's stubbornness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the water temperature?" Anna sank the black fire into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A little hotter... ah, that's just fine." Roland felt his feet surrounded by a warmth and couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, the black fire will turn into a ball, squeeze his instep and foot like a massager, and finally cover the entire foot and dry Residual moisture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of life is really easy to addicted to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you?" Anna sat down beside him. "Will you go with Nana Wa tomorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, another person is Sylvie, her surveillance ability is irreplaceable for the defending army." Roland held the other's hand, "I can certainly stabilize the people's mind when I go back." Role, but they always have to get used to dealing with trouble without me sitting in the town. In addition, the main force of the first army is not in place, I can play a very limited role. After the delivery of the two of them, the second It’s my turn to be with you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the hummingbird’s ability can’t take effect on the living thing, the number of people who are being loaded at one time is limited to two people. The float depends on the specific weight of the loader. Lightning can also carry one person's actions, but the height will drop sharply. Basically, it can only fly against the treetops, and it can be used for emergency. It is too unsafe to take a long-range voyage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going from Hermes to No Winter City is a long journey, even if the wheat can continue to fly after the sun sets, without having to spend time every day to eat It takes nearly three days for a one-way trip. He can only ship in batches according to the urgency of the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the army will gradually move south along the inland river, and the interval between each batch of personnel will be shortened accordingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can have a faster mode of transportation," Anna looked up. "For example, a machine that can fly in the sky."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not easy, unless--" Roland wanted to say that without an internal combustion engine, it would be impossible to create a truly usable aircraft, but halfway through, an idea suddenly came from him. The flash of his mind made him subconsciously change his mouth. "Wait, maybe it's not something that can't be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to do "The blue eyes of Anna Lake suddenly sparkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Using the power of Wendy and the mystery," Roland thought, "If it's just for manned... the combination of the two may make it work." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the inspiration that McMug’s bombing plan has brought him. If you don’t pursue mass production or versatility, the witch’s ability can play in many ways. The same effect as the machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three years of accumulation, No Winter City now has lightweight aluminum, an arithmetic institute that can perform large calculations, and verification results. The central carrier, an unpowered, or weakly powered glider, is not an elusive goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
