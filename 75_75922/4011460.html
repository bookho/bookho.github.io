Mai Mai opened the white hair before the forehead, revealing a pair of curious eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a magic stone," Ai Gesha picked up the stone on the ground and looked at it. "Although it's not clear which type, but looking at the color, Before the conversion, it should be the stone of great quality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The high-end devil's spoils will definitely not go bad," the leaves laughed. "I just didn't expect it to hide the box in the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, if you say that, how many other devils will have such a box?" "Mc茜 excited, "I am looking for it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful not to encounter the jars that store red fog!" Ai Gesha said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, Mai Hao rushed to hold two black boxes and ran over, "searched from the devil wearing colorful clothes!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is still the magic stone, but this time the stone looks dull, and the size of the stone is a bit smaller, just a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha collected the magic stone together and could not help but frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Night owl asked, "Is there anything wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Stone ...it seems too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is light Lightly shaking his head, "The Federation will kill thousands of fears. If the magic stone is so good, the Quest will not painstakingly want to capture and raise the Chaos. Why do they carry so many magical creatures with them?" Stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably it has accumulated over the past four hundred years?" The nightingale showed an ugly smile, "It’s like a bit of a good With a savings, I decided to finish the hapless work of going home and planting the land. As a result, we were shot and all the estates were cheaper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No When people laugh out, everyone realizes the meaning behind this. If a huge group of people has never stopped producing magic stones for four hundred years, their war resources will accumulate. What kind of degree? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, it’s useless to think too much," after a brief colddown, Ai Gesha broke the silence. "We don't have a second way anyway. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Army finally arrived at the woodland under the guidance of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are all okay!" Wendy anxiously jumped from behind the lightning and checked every sister, "Anna she..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The coma caused by the exhaustion of magic, don't worry," the nightingale comforted. "Everyone is not serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I have already said that," the head of Lightning has been bandaged, only to reveal the bangs in front of the forehead. "When Wendy is still urging me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This, this is...what!" Brian looked at the corpse in a row with astonishment. "Is they the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, the dead devil," the night sherbling shrugged. "You have to let the soldiers move them back. The meat, armor, clothing, and weapons that are carried can not be less. This is the order of your majesty." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Upon hearing the order, Brian suddenly became serious. "I will arrange for someone to do it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&& "Unfortunately, I couldn't catch a living devil," Aegusa sighed. "The plan to make the seal has to be postponed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The living devil?" Lightning screamed, "About 喔!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Everyone looked at her with a gaze, "Where?" ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, the paddle steamer left the river bank and turned back to the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deck of one of the ships was filled with curious and suspicious First Army soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the enemy we will face in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't look too much Well, except for the big ones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, what are you talking about," someone shouted. "I didn't see the witches underneath. You have not seen their abilities!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, those who died are definitely fierce, at least more difficult than evil animals, even Anna’s adults were recruited.” Another person nodded and added, “She was alone at the time and blocked the wall gap and blocked the impact of the evil beasts.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is endorsed by most soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... I was there that day, Anna also saved my life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If it weren't for her, I would have been trampled to death by a wild boar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately Miss Angel is not here, or they will get better soon." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale standing at the stern and Ai Gesha looked at each other and shook their heads with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ordinary people now regard the witch as a companion who can fight side by side. It is a fresh feeling for both people - one originally lives in the mortal For the slave witch empire, a Zengdong hides in Tibet and suffers from the exclusion and persecution of the people... Although the content of the feeling is the opposite, it is equally unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" The nightingale asked after secretly feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean the guinea pig that was recovered?" Ai Gesha smiled. "I think it should be lucky."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects that the soldiers watched were the drowning demon who were held in the iron cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As lightning said, the unlucky devil was rushed by the burning flame of the hydrogen balloon explosion, and it was restored after falling into the water. But the body was severely wounded, struggling for a long time and couldn't swim back to the shore, and was eventually captured by the searched Mai Mai. According to the latter, if it wasn't it, she would not necessarily notice the other party. Obviously, the madman used the wheat scorpion as a fearful beast of rescue, and as a result, he became a captive of the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that the magic and physical strength of Effie have reached the limit, there may be no way to trap the devil for too long. In the end, everyone decided to cut off the devil's limbs. Ai Gesha ice sealed the wound. In this way, the enemy can neither commit suicide nor die immediately before the red fog is exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect to be able to complete the task satisfactorily after such a big change. It is indeed lucky." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, don't you take a break?" Aegusa pointed her finger at the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s much better after smearing the herbs," she said in a careless manner. "I didn’t meet Roland’s squatting. All the pain in the AIDS was solved by leaves. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, everyone is safe and sound," Ai Gesha said with a sigh of relief. "This action is my negligence."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High-level devil? It’s not your fault." The nightingale comforted, "No one knows that they will appear alone in this remote place."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also something I don't want to understand... After all, they have always been hiding behind the army, never acting alone, and the number is extremely rare. In the decades of fighting with the Federation, all The high-level devils who appeared will be recorded, including twenty in the dead." She paused. "I thought I had to wait until the red moon came to have a chance to meet them, but see those Magic Stone, I am suddenly uncertain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
