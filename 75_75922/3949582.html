			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dungeon in the town and nothing he changed when he came a year ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large-scale infrastructure did not take this place into consideration, although the houses and roads above were replaced with new ones, and they became regular and bright, but the underground prisons remained Full of decay and ruin. Moss was formed on the stone wall, and the dirty water ran down the steps, making a noisy ticking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference is that there are very few prisoners in the dungeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the expansion of the territory, people will always find a job to fill their stomachs if they are willing to work. The villains who refused to repent were all sent to the mine by Roland, where there were naturally whip and sticks to teach them the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the bottom cell was destroyed by Anna and there was no need to repair it, it simply sealed the entrance and abandoned it. Roland followed the iron axe to the third floor of the prison and saw the detained priest - he was also the only prisoner on this floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party has not been hung on the criminal frame, or a copy of the tortured flesh and blood, in short, completely different from Roland’s envisioned torture scene. He sat in the corner of the cell with the cold wall, his clothes were basically intact, but he looked a little wilting, his face pale, his eyes stunned, like losing his focus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hes okay?" Roland asked in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is not big, Your Highness," the iron axe bent down and replied, "If you have any questions, you can ask him directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince nodded. It seems that the torture method of the sand people is indeed different, but he is not interested in how the iron axe is done, and does not want to explore whether it is humane, as long as it can be obtained. The result is just fine. He cleared his throat and sat down on the wooden bench next to the cell. He opened the door through the iron railing. "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are gray Fort Four Prince... Roland Wimbledon?” The other’s eyes had a little change. “Look... see what you have done, you released the power of the devil.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Highness is asking your name," Iron Axe said coldly. "If you don't want to repeat the punishment last night, it's best not to say extra nonsense."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the official was suddenly frozen, and he paused for a moment before he said, "I... my name is Campas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen Say you are from the holy city of Hermes?” Roland looked at each other. “Who is the witch who is with you, is she from the Holy City? What position is it in the church?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She..." Campas looked hesitant and responded for a long time. "She is called Aurora, the pure man of Teflon, not in the church." Position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tefron?" The prince thought for a while, and the name seemed to have been seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is one of the three great bishops of the Holy City, responsible for the external affairs of the church, and is also the second largest person behind the Pope," the official explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland finally remembered that he did have seen this person - at the celebration of Wang Du. On that day, Wimbledon III hosted a grand rite of honor for Tilly Wimbledon, and the bishop who presided over the ceremony was Teflon. In the picture in memory, the other person looks like a kind old man with a smile and compassion in his smile, as if any ugly things in the world could not be related to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is pure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampas hesitated again until the iron axe Exclaimed, he reluctantly confessed, "Pure people are witches trained by the church. Only the bishops or the pope can control them. I don't know much about the news of these people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland scratched his ear and asked for proof at night, and the response was that the other party did not lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many people know about the hidden witches?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shrine shook his head "I was also told by the Master Teflon in the last two years, and he told me that I can never mention it to other believers, so... I don't know who knows the news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
