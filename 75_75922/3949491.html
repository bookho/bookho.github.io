			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church is like a sudden pop out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until back to the office, Roland I still echo this sentence in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and searched the memory of the Four Princes carefully, still could not find more relevant content. His understanding of the church is similar to that of ordinary nobility. In the palace, the four princes did not spend much time learning knowledge, and occultism was almost blank. But if Tilly is telling the truth, then the propaganda strategy of the church is too strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the original world's religious legends as an analogy. The gods originated in the world at the beginning of the pediatrics. The world is created by the gods and is the routine that everyone chooses. For example, creation on the 7th, karma reincarnation, etc.... A set of legends that fully describe the power of God is the standard for every religion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The churches of this world are quite...innocent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland didn’t have more clues to continue the research. He shook his head and decided to leave these thoughts behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps after waiting to explore the ancient remains of the fascinating forest, everything will have an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the window and looked at the huge coating on the ground in the garden - in the white snow, its green appearance It is particularly eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that Soroya is bonding larger airbags, the new hot air balloon will be even larger and will carry more people. This is because if you can't find a way to save the trapped woman when exploring the ruins, simply let Anna chop the whole "ice" and bring her back to Bianbu Town along with a part of the transparent spar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The departure time is scheduled to be two days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff has made arrangements for the sleepy island witches with Tilly, Sylvie, Sawyer, Ashes and Andrea. The Witch Alliance will send Anna, Wendy, Nightingale, Nana, Lightning, and McMug. This lineup is unprecedentedly powerful, with attack, defense and battlefield perception reaching the highest level. As long as the stone of the gods is not used, it is difficult for the devil to have a chance to approach them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, Chief Alchemist Kemer Stoul wants to see you," said the guard outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo did not come alone this time, he also brought With his own colleague Chames, "His Royal Highness, the large-scale nitric acid method you requested, has already had a clue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real?" Roland Pico Oh, then a burst of joy came to my heart. This is probably the best news I have heard in recent days. He stood up excitedly and poured a cup of tea for the two chemists. "Quickly, how is it made?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the credit of Chamez," he said with a smile on his beard. "Let him come and explain it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Respected Your Highness," the young Chames looked a bit cautious. He said after his salute, "Your alchemy workshop... No, the chemical laboratory produces nitric acid, which is diluted with saltpeter. After the nitric acid, it was purified by concentrated sulfuric acid. I tried to put the two together and directly heated the saltpeter into concentrated sulfuric acid. The result was a nitric acid solution, and the purity was very high. Even the elementary chemistry was observed. The smoking phenomenon described in it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Communication? But the two are not the same thing," Roland said strangely. "The temperature of the dry distillation is better than the heat." It is much higher, and the gas distilled from the distillation should be nitrogen oxides, which is formed into the water to form dilute nitric acid. Concentrated sulfuric acid purification is only a benefit. The principle of high boiling point and strong water absorption reduces the water content in nitric acid and does not involve chemical reactions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't quite understand why, but Mr. Dürr then did several experiments and thought that my discovery was a coincidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Coincidence?" Roland looked to the chief alchemist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true," Kemo affirmed. "The two are not the same, but they have the same effect. I derived it according to the chemical formula and guessed this. It should be that a certain component of the saltpeter reacts with sulfuric acid to form nitric acid and evaporate it under heating. According to the formula, it looks like something... well, nitrate.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
