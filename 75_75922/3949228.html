			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After four days, the North Slope Mine burned the backyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two deep holes dug in the ground in the yard, each of which is round, narrow and wide. The inner diameter of the front section is approximately twenty centimeters and the inner diameter of the rear end is expanded to twenty-six centimeters. These holes are the mold Roland intends to use to cast the shell. The inner wall of the hole has been baked by Anna, and the surface soil is sintered into a whole, as if a layer of shell is attached. The medicine chamber is facing down for better wall quality when casting, and the more scum and air bubbles are contained above. The size of all caves is calculated by shells. He roughly remembers that the so-called six-pound gun and eight-pound gun in history are named after the weight of the shell. So he first poured out a few twelve pounds of iron balls, then according to the iron. The ball diameter plus the barrel wall thickness is used to calculate the inner diameter of the mold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of a measurement tool, Roland simply customizes the standard. He intercepts a piece of iron that is about the same width as his fingerless nails. Centimeters, and then make iron bars of other sizes, and engrave the segmentation line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diameter of a twelve-pound iron ball is about 12 cm under the measurement of a rough iron ruler. He sets the thinnest wall thickness to four centimeters. In order to prevent the bombing, the wall thickness of the rear-end drug room was expanded to seven centimeters, and the inner diameter of the mold was obtained. As for the length, although he knows that the artillery has a diameter, he has the impression that only the main guns of the battleship and the main tank are left. As for the antique front-loading gun, he really does not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that the shorter the body, the lighter the weight, and the more material, Roland took a wave and took a value of one meter five. If the test results are not satisfactory, adjust them later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the artillery was first invented, it was made of iron bars and iron powder on the wooden core material, and then reinforced with iron hoops and finally burned out. The core material is like a storage barrel. Roland certainly knows that this kind of artillery has the risk of leaking and exploding, so the process of integral casting and boring machine drilling is directly adopted. For steam boring machines, it is not difficult to drill a six-pound gun or a twelve-pound gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the concept of justice, he naturally chose a 12-pound gun with a larger muzzle and a thicker barrel. Going up, it is not easy to use as a field gun. It doesn't matter whether the weight of the shell is calculated by shot or by the iron ball. It can be played. After all, he is learning from history, not playing with copy models. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Begin," Roland took a deep breath and said to Anna. The latter nodded, grabbing a steel ingot and hanging over the hole. When the green flame ignited, the ingot quickly turned red and then melted, forming a small molten steel waterfall that flowed into the hole. The surface of the molten steel is reddish-orange, and the inner core turns into incandescent, and its brightness is difficult to see directly. In order to protect the witch's vision, Roland also deliberately set up support at the hole. She only needs to determine the position in advance and rest her arm on the support pad so that she can watch the flow into the hole without staring at the molten steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These steel ingots are slowly accumulating, and the power of Anna alone cannot open the era of large steelmaking, but the small batch production is not for her. Under the words - after the most difficult temperature level is solved, the steel can be used to obtain better quality steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Roland dared to customize the size of the barrel. Steel cast guns clearly have higher strength than cast iron barrels and bronze barrels. Even if the size is wrong, the artillery will not be easily blown up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The molten steel is gradually rising, and the stored steel ingots are also rapidly decreasing. It seems that Roland can not help but feel a little heartache. When will he wait until he can build a stack of chimneys and blast furnaces on the territory to refine the inexhaustible steel? For a long time, steel production was one of the criteria for measuring the strength of the powers. He now feels it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filling the two molds, Anna’s cheeks became red. Roland smashed the handkerchief and gently wiped the sweat from her nose. At the beginning, Anna would also show some resistance. Now she has been motionless and closed her eyes to let Roland Shi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The falling bangs dyed a red rim under the molten steel, and the soft neck made people want to take a bite. When you are condescending, the half of the slender collar that is exposed through the collar will enter your field of vision. Close to the door, but also smell the scent of her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, well..." Roland put away his handcuffs and retracted his emotions. "Come here today. Good job, dinner." I will tell the kitchen to reward you with a black pepper steak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
