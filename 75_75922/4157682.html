			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of God, the lower layer of the birth tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the core area of ​​the city. There are countless plaques deposited here, forming a crystal-like bright red lake, completely submerging the bottom of the tower and the god stone. In a certain sense, it is the "source of magic" created by the ethnic group, which not only strengthens the transformation ability of the birth tower, but also is a necessary place for cultivating higher magic stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the promotion rituals that drive the growing community are often carried out here, and each city may have its own differences, but in the lower sacred area The structure is basically the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing through the ceremony square, the silence of the silence stopped for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the familiar scene, it seems to have heard countless people shouting the name of "Shalit", walking slowly in the white robe of Vakiris Come to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... It’s just that from the dust scattered on the slate, it’s obviously not open for a long time. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the widespread use of underground symbiosis technology, the promotion ceremony of the original body to the ascending body has been replaced by implantation, the primary body after the screening There is a higher chance of being promoted, which greatly increases the number of ascending bodies and constitutes the backbone of the current combat power of the ethnic group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technology that dominates this technique is the masked monarch Nasopelle, who claims that as long as the research continues, it is not only the initial ascension, but even the high-level promotion. It is also hoped that a large number of cultures will be carried out in the same way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many people have questioned that this not only undermines ancient traditions but also jeopardizes the stability of the ethnic group, the king has given affirmation and support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the promotion of promotion success can greatly enhance the strength of the ethnic group, but its defects are also facts - in these hundreds of years, the number of rising bodies It’s dozens of times, but there are only a handful of people who have been promoted to the ranks through rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the future promotion and the Maharaja can be born through the magic stone implant, this sacred place that bears witness to countless glory will probably become nothing. Necessary...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cerroshhi sighs out the gas and extinguishes all the thoughts in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recollection means 踌躇, and 踌躇 will bring flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what it absolutely needs to abandon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the square, it walked into the central tower on the rock wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards here have bowed to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all the way unimpeded, the silence of the disaster found the magic source of their lock in the control room at the top of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" Nasopelle seems to be focusing on adjusting the structure of the magic core, asking without looking back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hilt is unsheathed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cerroshhi jumped forward and sneaked toward the mask-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is the first shot after it has recovered. The first shot is used! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask is not good at fighting, this is what the great monarchs know, but Cerroshahi knows that it is on a fair battlefield - if it is put Outside, ten masks are not enough to fear, whether it is the level of magic or physical strength, it is far better than the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention the experience and instinct of tens of thousands of lives and deaths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a wild place here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blunt beast can turn the nest of a long time into a secluded cave, not to mention Nasopelle. From the god of God's creation to the arrival of the Twilight border, this time is enough for the other party to transform the lower area into its own territory. In other words, it stood on the very unfavorable battlefield from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance of dozens of steps is fleeting, and the speed of the upgrade to the extreme makes the blade a cold light, accompanied by the ripples of the open air, straight into the body of Naspere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter made a scream of horror and pain, and the whole room seemed to be alive, and countless stone needles spurred from all directions, blocking the silence. All the way out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had to pull out the long-handled sword and quickly retreat. The ghost blade of the body formed an impervious blade wall in the body, and the stone needle was all down. The crashing sound of the cockroach is endless! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...this is what you are doing!" Nasopelle shouted at the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disaster of silence re-raised the weapon and launched a second round of offense - the touch of the previous blow was not like the feeling of piercing a living thing. It is more like plunging into a pile of grease and metal parts. It vaguely realizes that the other party is transforming into another species, no matter what it will eventually become, and it is difficult to fall back into the same category. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that it does not answer, the mask is reaching out, and the surrounding stone walls rise and rise, revealing the symbiosis buried in flesh and blood. At the same time, it also smashed into a strange symbiosis behind it - the latter opened its body and contained most of its body. The combination of the two is like a deformed monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the symbiosis of its new research? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cerroshahi did not hesitate to cast a long-handled sword, and the sword passed through the symbiosis gap that was surrounded, and the mask was inserted precisely. Inside the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leaves the other half of the body still exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it releases the spirit, so that the golden thunder engulfs the entire control room! Under the shining light, the stone needle symbiosis slammed, and the new symbiosis did not go anywhere. The long-handled sword became the direction indicator to guide the gods, and a large amount of magic was poured into the target through the hilt. A long, screaming scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the spark of the four-shot, Cerroshahi jumped over the fallen symbiosis and once again caught the scorching sword. It uses the fall of the force to push the weapon down screamingly - the screams stop and the blade ends up at the same time, cutting from the front of the mask to the top of the head, and smashing its upper body into two half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dangdang."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask split into two from the top of Nasperper , dropped on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twenty-two...seconds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned slowly and used a The only remaining face said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Is this the last thing you want to say?" Cerroshhi pulled out the blood-stained weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human...the timing unit is good, I just used it." The mask said intermittently, "And this is also...the symbiosis block Your time. Oh... I thought it would be a little longer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The closer the battle is to death, the more I can make a breakthrough," The expression said, "I am stronger now than the one before the serious injury. Unfortunately, you and your creations will never be able to comprehend this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So ... I hate the uncertain things." The voice of the mask is gradually low. "But, uncertainty means that you can't re-enact... As long as you spend the day, I will be able to transcend the limits of the group..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There will be no future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is this... sure?" There was a strange smile on his face. "Remember... what did I say? In front of knowledge, a strong body... but that's it..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cerroshhi’s instinct suddenly felt a strong danger! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, let me... give you a present." The mask whispered, "That is what I collected from humans... You should not be unfamiliar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
