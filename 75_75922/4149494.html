			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to speed up the research project, Roland slightly adjusted the schedule, and spent two or three hours in the office after lunch every day, which is equivalent to an increase in disguise. The number of times to enter the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also for this reason, the martial arts warriors appearing in groups after noon have become a wonder in the castle area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to the help of the Grey House Design Bureau, a new batch of industrial projects have progressed quite smoothly. By the last week of the fall season, the tractors have basically completed the finalization. design. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, all the project processes without winter were first hand-made, validated and finalized by Anna, then divided into production parts, delivered to the factory single machine test Production, and finally, is to determine the flow plan until assembly. It takes a long time to go, and it is easy to take a detour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in the division of production parts - because the processing power of black fire is far better than any machine tool, the parts that Anna can cut out, the factory is not necessarily Can make it. One machine has hundreds of parts and components, and it is undoubtedly a huge amount of engineering to determine which ones can be completed by the factory itself and which ones must be handed over to Anna. This project can only enter the mass production phase after a complete assembly has been assembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, before the second generation of steam engines were produced, they suffered from this link. Although a pressure valve component seems simple, it is only when it is officially mass-produced. It was found that the pass rate was astonishingly low. The result was that the relevant production line was overthrown and the final product was delayed for more than half a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Graysburg Design Bureau is equivalent to completing all the preliminary work for Anna, from test stereotypes to assembly design, and ordinary machine tools can not meet the requirements, these processes are Can be done directly in the dream world. Therefore, once the program is finalized, the Ministry of Industry can organize production immediately, which also greatly shortens the development cycle and cost of the new project. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland named the farm machinery that was highly anticipated as the "Bumper". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will inherit the name of the five pairs of heavy wheels and work on the land of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he did not let Master Xie leisurely, now the harvest number is just a simple chassis, hanging a plow as a tractor, but the problem is not big, but There is still a long way to go from the ultimate form of the five pairs of heavy wheels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hopes to achieve all the military needs on the chassis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the reporting machine, Qinglan has quickly recruited several candidates, including both recent graduates and folk radio enthusiasts, but Roland As soon as I saw those circuit diagrams, my head went up, and finally I ordered all the changes to the physical map form to barely distinguish what was. Even so, his study of this knowledge is extremely slow, he can only forcibly memorize the sample, and then slowly ponder with Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to these two major projects, there are several other key preparation projects for the absence of Winter City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the North-South Great Art Program. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovde Quin sent a letter to him saying that he has invested nearly a thousand people in the morning and set up a cement calcining plant in two cities on the border. These plants produce hundreds of tons of cement every day to meet the needs of hardened roads. Nowadays, the road from the windward to the flash river has been basically laid, and the second half of the cage mountain has been started. It is expected to be completed in about half a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the help of Lian and Molly, this construction speed is enough to say that it is excellent, obviously the Quin family has a lot of things on this matter. effort. Together with the first completion of the Chishui River eastbound turning point to the road to Yongyue City, this means that no winter can only be sent from land to a war zone thousands of kilometers away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the supporting project of the aorta plan - the "Hump" steam truck, the first one is also in the factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It uses a classic flat-head cab, engine front, front and rear double six-wheel layout, except that the head is slightly longer (in order to plug the huge water tank), There is almost no difference between the shape and the trucks of later generations. It has a self-weight of about ten tons and a designed load capacity of six tons. It can maintain a stable speed of 40 kilometers per hour on a flat cement road and continuously open for three hundred kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
