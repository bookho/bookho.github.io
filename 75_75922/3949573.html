			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is gray, whether it is the sky, the ground, or the ocean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The south-central part of the Grey Fort is not covered by the endless snow, but it can’t avoid the influence of the evil moon. The sun is not visible on the top of the head. The clouds occupy the entire sky. The earth rises into a pale fog, and all the mud, rocks and jungles are buried. There is only one black and gray mountain peak, and the head is exposed from the clouds, and it is advancing toward the southern end of the mainland. This is also the target of the nightingales. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was flying in the sky, she experienced the terrible coldness of the unobstructed wind - even if she put it on her front seat Special windproof clothing, scarves and cuffs can't resist the cold. Especially the ears and fingers, will soon lose consciousness because of the low temperature, have to stop and rest for a while, so the full speed flight as long as half a day, and finally extended to the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are here," Lightning came closer to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nights peeped out and saw that the ridges underfoot became much lower, like sinking into the ground, a city built on a mountain faintly In the fog, this should be their goal - falling dragon ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let’s land,” she patted McMur’s broad back. “Be careful not to let others see it.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Mai Hao nodded, gathered his wings and glided down. The fog came over and quickly enveloped the three people until they landed. The nightingale discovered that the visibility around it was astonishingly low. It was almost fifty steps away. It was difficult to tell what was in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is good news for witches, at least not easily found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the fog, the world will appear in a true face, and she is not worried that she will fall into the arms of the judges of the church because of the thick fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are waiting for me here," said the Nightingale. "It should take a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness gave me an alert in the air," Lightning shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also asked me to be in charge of emergency contact, to avoid you kidnapping the target!" Mai Hao re-emerged as a fat pigeon, kneeling on the head of the little girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highness is making a meaningless entrustment, and the nightingale reluctantly thinks, "If that's the case, then let's go."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has turned black and white in two moments, and the fog has disappeared—or, they have become other forms that can no longer hinder their observations. Everything in front of me was suddenly clear, and the dark wall appeared two hundred meters away. It extended from the side of the mountain and connected the city to the mountain like a hood. Compared to the outer wall of the Long Song Fortress, this stone wall is much shorter, and the city has not seen the guards on the whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale walked to the wall, easily found the entrance made up of twisted lines, took a step forward, and was already behind the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is half the size of the fortress, just to explore this part of the mountain wall, the scale is more like a small town. However, the body of the Dragon Ridge is located in the rock, and the castle of the Lord is embedded in the middle of the mountain, which can be seen from afar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale confirmed that the lightning and wheat stalks followed the way into the city and walked straight toward the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work is no stranger to her, and can even be called very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When driven by the old Gülen, sneaking into other noble residences and castles is a common task. These houses are mostly the same structure. The rooms are located in the most central and most spacious location. At that time, she was still unable to penetrate the wall freely. She could only hide her own figure, carefully avoiding possible traps and stones of punishment, and stealing the letters and documents hidden in the cupboard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that there is a fog, nature is even more important. The stone of the gods inlaid at the corner of the castle channel presents a dark black hole, like hanging in the night sky. The bright moon is generally eye-catching. The hidden organs are nowhere to be seen, and their twisted contours are like gentle squirming, and she can easily destroy them through the walls. Within the scope of the ability, the nightingale is completely free to move, and the walls, door leaves and roofs are invisible in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
