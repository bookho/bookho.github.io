			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second day after the rain stopped, Bianbu Town was bustling again, and many villagers gathered in the square, and they were waiting for the speech of the Four Princes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this speech, Roland posted a notice on the bulletin board the day before, and anyone who came to the square to listen to it could get a wheat porridge. And half a loaf of bread. For the townspeople, this is equivalent to a white lunch, so there are many more people than when they watch the hanging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be close to noon, Roland boarded the set high platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a crowd of black pressure under his feet, he has to say that he is not nervous, that is to lie to himself. The most common thing he used to deal with was the computer monitor. Even when he was in a meeting, he only used the drums to applaud. This is the first time that a big scene that needs to be played in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he had to go up and want to keep everyone in Bianbu Town, you must have a general mobilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland waved and calmed everyone down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene has been practiced many times alone, but when it comes to the stage, the mouth is still a bit dry. "My people, good at noon. I am gray." Four Princes of the Kingdom of Fort, Roland. Wimbledon. At this moment, everyone is called up because there is an important news to tell you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long Song Fortress The messengers arrived here four days ago. They came for the ore delivery. Everyone knows that a month ago, we suffered an unfortunate accident and the North Slope mine collapsed. Until today, the mine has not fully resumed production. The accident caused the ore to have only two months of output last quarter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I explained the situation to the messenger and hoped he could get the full amount The food was allocated to Bianbu Town, and the missing ore was added after the end of the winter. But he refused! Without any room for negotiation, he refused to allocate more food - just like two years ago."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd burst into exclamation, obviously everyone’s two years ago Food event impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this time it’s obviously worse. The astrologer of the Grey Fort tells me that this winter will be longer than ever, and the Demon Moon is likely to last four More than a month. That is to say, this time everyone is likely to face a two-month food gap. Two years ago you lost 20% of your companions, some lost their brothers, some lost their children, this time, you have to prepare How much is lost?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No! Your Highness, save us!” Someone shouted underneath, and then more people shouted, “His Highness, Begging You, help us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that preparing a few supports in advance is the right choice. Roland raises his hand and presses down the voices of everyone. "Of course, I won't leave my people, no one! You may not know that the wheat and bread that the fortress transports every year are not equivalent to the ore they transported. At normal market prices, as long as two months. The ore is enough to exchange for half a year of food! I have sold the ore to the merchants in Liuye Town. The cargo ships that transport food will soon arrive in Bianbu Town. In addition to bread, there are cheese, honey, and dried meat! For a full winter, everyone can eat!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of cheers in the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, this is equivalent to breaking the relationship with the long song fortress, they will not accommodate another person, so this winter, we will be in the border town Most people have already seen that a strong wall is being built on the west side of Bianbu Town. I know if someone is worried about the evil beasts, can we block them. I want to tell you that the evil beast is no better than the beast in the forest. How strong, although they are thick and thick, they can't climb the wall, they can't bite the stone, and the skin is thicker than a group of poor targets!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Tell me, my people, are you willing to hide in the shack of the fortress, starve to death, or under my leadership, protect your loved ones and children, guard the border town to the last moment? I promise here, As long as you stick to the end of the demon moon, all the townspeople who fought on the city wall will receive the reward of twenty-five silver dragons. Anyone who has unfortunately sacrificed, his family will receive the compensation of five golden dragons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"will be the temple Fight! "Under the guidance of care, the people have shouted a fight to the death battle. Seeing the high atmosphere, Roland ordered the release of lunch. He did not expect everyone to stay in Bianbu Town. As long as half of them are willing to stay, he is sure to block the footsteps of the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
