			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the war order was issued, no winter city would work efficiently immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bag of wheat from the Dragon Ridge was quickly filled with vacant granaries, some of which will be shelled and ground to make dry food, Send it to the soldiers in the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there are firearms and ammunition--the new recruits who have expanded their enemies during the evil month have also completed basic training, and the outstanding performance will be mixed into the first The army officially lined up to receive new weapons and uniforms. Ordinary ones will temporarily be used as reserve forces, and will be assigned to the cities occupied by Roland instead of those stationed veterans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the available strength of No Winter City is rapidly expanded to 5,000. In theory, the number of trials in the church is almost the same, but due to the limitation of transportation capacity. The farther away from the West, the lower the number of people who can enter the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that the task of the tooth extraction operation was not strong, Roland finally set the troops to be 1,500, and the iron axe served as the conductor. Moreover, in this operation, the staff was moved into the system of the First Army. The main members were composed of nobles, knights and ordinary people in the Changge District. For example, Sir Xiel, the father of dawn, and the chief of the honeysuckle family. Traf and others, they either experienced the baptism of artillery, or they served in the Second Army. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although these people are not from the class, Roland still has the idea of ​​forming, learning, and a few people to make suggestions. It’s just that they don’t have the actual commanding power, and whether the deductions and plans they make are finally adopted, they have to be decided by the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the tooth extraction may encounter the purity of the church, so the "eye of the magic" Sylvia and the "caught cage" Iphi will also attack the team. The former can detect the magic and warn the enemy, while the latter can arrest the purer if allowed. And Sylvie will also bring a hearing and a stamp to make contact with the Winter City at any time. As a result, an army with modern military structure, firepower and communication capabilities will slowly emerge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tooth extraction operation is mainly for the three towns closest to the west of Chishui City, Yinguang City and Jieshang Fort. It takes about four days from the preparation to the departure. Reliable guards traveled outside the old holy city, and the rest of the time was constantly discussing with the army commanders and staff the details of the battle with the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it is difficult to decide where to hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue, everyone has their own opinions, and it is difficult for anyone to convince each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battalion commander Brian is a staunch Western striker. The reason is also very full. "If the battle is launched in the west, the first army can fully exert its firepower advantage." With a large number of paddle steamers as logistical support, ammunition and personnel can be replenished in one day. No matter how long we play, we have the confidence to win. At the same time, this distance is extremely unfavorable for the church, as long as there is no breakthrough within one month. The defense, they estimated that even the rice can not be eaten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Isis is the advocate of the overseas combat group, "Can't eat rice? You know the gray fort How many church believers are there? Even if the church is completely burned, as long as the Pope makes a command, these people will come to the door with all kinds of food. And in mid-July is the season of wheat ripening, as long as the trial army Occupying one or two cities, the energy source is constantly being replenished. This is not the most terrible. Does the church have a mad pill that can make ordinary people become monsters? Once the battle is unfavorable, they scream for the gray castle people. What should I do with this pill to consume the strength of the First Army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don’t know anything about gunpowder weapons," Fanner also stood on the cloth. Ryan side, "It's a hard work to transport artillery and ammunition. They are not like swords. They can be used while wearing them. The materials consumed in a battle need several ships to replenish. If you say that the enemy has not yet entered the ash. Before the fort, I will take the initiative to meet. What should I do if the ammunition is finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really don't understand the gunpowder weapons you said, and I don't know how you fight specifically. But the most important thing for any war is the purpose - if it does not achieve the intended purpose, even if it wins, it will fail." Itis is inseparable. "Everyone who needs the gray castle, you let the church enter the kingdom." Consumption of people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can't win, everything doesn't make sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Solution Those problems that seem impossible to solve are what we should do. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
