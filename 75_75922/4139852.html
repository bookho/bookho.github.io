			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the alarm, the front line suddenly entered the highest alert state according to emergency response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quick, fast! Lose the tools in your hands and find the nearest refuge channel!" The soldiers responsible for evacuation led the engineering team to evacuate the site. "Don't push Squeeze, don't look around! Remember, no matter what happens outside, you can't leave the refuge without permission!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Sixth Refuge is full!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. 7 is not in the crowd!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go back, go to the next shelter Don't block the passage, move it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time this happened, although the soldiers’ screams are coming and going, the atmosphere is quite tense. But did not lose order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly two thousand workers dispersed like tidal waves, and successively entered one underground bunker along the pre-set evacuation passages - these were opened by the lotus The temporary shelter is located behind the line of defense, with steel plates on the top, which are not only accessible, but also effective against spear attacks and machine guns. As long as the outer ring does not fall, hiding in it means safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the crowd retired, the original brightly lit construction site was quickly overshadowed by the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The evacuation of the engineering team was basically completed, the lights were normal, and the first army was entering the position." Hillvi quickly looked around and communicated the latest situation to the various units. At this moment, the observation room above the theater headquarters can be said to be the busiest place on the front line. More than ten telephones on the long table are ringing, which makes people feel overwhelmed; the staff member who is responsible for answering sits around the table and confirms the news. Willy will be notified of the importance of the situation. On the other hand, there are quite a few staff officers who gather the news and feed it back to the sand table or map to provide a key basis for the decision of the command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Sylvie was the "eyes" of the army before, the observation room built around her is now the information center of the entire army, as long as she is in town The operational efficiency of the First Army can be several times higher than usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...Yes, I know. Miss Sylvie, the artillery battalion calls, I hope you can provide the enemy's position and test coordinates." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are also the same requests from Heihe No. 1 and No. 2!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let them wait a second time," Hillvi swept the front line. The "black shadow" was not moving fast, probably a little slower than walking. Now it has just entered the ten-kilometer shooting circle. According to this speed, I am afraid that it will take five or six hours to approach the front of the position. Therefore, it is imperative to find out the intention behind the devil - what kind of tricks do they want to use the blind spot of the stone of the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When magic detection is ineffective, the eye is undoubtedly the most reliable method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picks up the listener, "Lightning, McMug, can you hear me? Where are you now?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just just ascended, Mai Hao is on my head." After a while, another piece of the seal sent the other party's answer, and at the same time, there was a high-pitched alarm, "Occurred What happened? Did the devil launch a general attack on us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The look is very similar, but the enemy interferes with the observation of the magic eye, and the range is very large. I guess Like the last time, I am afraid it is a large stone of gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Understood, I will take a look at it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give us the 咕!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the intense and busy atmosphere in the observation room, in the eyes of lightning, this time The battlefield is another look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light at the foot is shrinking a little bit, just like being swallowed up by the night. The land in the distance is dark and dark and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fertile plain seems to be still in a deep sleep, without any warning of the coming of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mc., turn on night vision mode!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕咕咕!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pigeon's feathers swelled rapidly, wrapping the body into a ball, and then a huge head was drilled out of the feathers, and the rounded eyeballs occupied almost the entire eyelid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Owl is finished!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then--<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning hands on the top of the "giant owl", flew to the northeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, before waiting to get close to Takira, listening to the seals suddenly sounded a quick call from Hilly. "Detection canceled, both of you are coming back!" The demon acted!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning suddenly shuddered, and even the limbs seemed to be stiff, and after trying to suppress the fear in her heart, she bit the The lips replied, "Even so, it shouldn't be so easy to find out. I am right. And... If I return now, what does the devil want to hide with the stone? Can't you know?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, it’s just impossible to catch up with me by flying the magic stone, just avoid it. A wide range of banned magic will do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning clenched his fists - although there was already cold sweat in his palm, she didn't want to escape this way. The battlefield experience of more than half a year made her understand that she is not a brave person. Not only is she a witch, but even an ordinary old man like a train conductor is much more brave than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she is not alone in facing all of this, behind her is Mai Mai, Luo Jia, Joan... and many partners are supporting her, can After she faced herself, she had the courage to start again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a little bit of resilience to re-detecting the devil, she crossed a level and finally came to the place where she fell six months ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two remaining difficulties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying in front of the Devil, and...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give it a hit— - As it hurts your own return! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mc茜, the other party's movements will be handed over to you." Lightning unbuttoned the collar, forcing the owl into the flight suit, leaving only one head Exposed to the outside, then directly into the speed of sound - just ten kilometers away, she can always stay in high-speed flight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zizi...beware, the enemy...Zizi...I noticed you..." Probably influenced by the magical coherence, Sylvie’s voice changed instantly Have to be intermittent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even without this reminder, Lightning knows that he has been exposed - as long as the devil is not a blind man, he will undoubtedly hear this sound across the sound barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but her movements are faster than the sound, which means that when the enemy hears the explosion, she has already passed over their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the interest rate, Mai Hao’s eagle eye caught the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The monster is in your right front!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the moonlight, Lightning has not found the demon, and you have seen a circle of black light suddenly spread! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the high-end devil's low-light vision is still on the top of the wheat--the other party not only sees her, but also approaches her flight route as much as possible. Next, and in the case of interception, the field of banned magic was directly launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, she raised the speed to the limit and changed from Pingfei to dive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the lightning even felt that the gloomy and cold black light had caught her ankle. But the illusion quickly dissipated, and between the breath, she had left the black light behind her. After breaking through the interception of the demon, there is no threat in front of her eyes. She pulls her back again and traverses the entire devil's position with a straight arc, and the bottom of the move is unobstructed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
