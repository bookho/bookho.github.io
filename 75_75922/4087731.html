			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia has no idea how he got out of the castle, she is a bit stunned Standing on the street, watching the people around me rush through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meeting was completely out of her expectations - in every respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to her assumptions, the great chief will first reject the strange appearance of her half-human and half-beast, and the mean king will show it directly, while the city is deeper. It will be expressionless. However, when she clarifies her own intentions, the attitude of the other party will change. After all, a free warrior should not be too much in the place, let alone she promised to help the winter city and the devil to fight. Who will refuse a good thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she will live in the castle area or be placed as a clan guest in the inner city hotel. Next, through the ashes, she will gradually know more witches, especially those who fight, and of course Miss Nana. Although not everyone will pay attention to her, but there will always be someone like her, hoping to make a move with different opponents, thus growing their skills. This kind of comparison is good for both sides, at least much more effective than boring the sandbags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything is ready, she will go to the place where the devil is haunted and begin to challenge her own practice - listening to the ashes, these enemies are hidden in the uninhabited northwest In the land, she is not afraid of survival in the wild, nor does she care how hidden the other is. The wolf itself is the master of the wilderness, and the extremely sensitive hearing and smell can help her find the opponent's nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the results are completely reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the awakening, Luo Jia was the first to hear someone praise her ears beautifully - even the father who did not disappoint her, often hangs in her mouth The other side of the sentence is also: "If you don't have these parts that are different from ordinary people, you are definitely one of the best girls in Iron Sands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf ears...Really Will it look good? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made her somewhat unprepared, so that every reaction to the follow-up conversation was slowed down half a beat. The chieftain did not dislike her appearance, but refused her request to take the initiative to participate in the devil's war. Until she left the castle, she could not completely return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, this is just a small setback. Luo Jia patted her cheek and took a deep breath. As long as she insisted on her own path, she would not be able to Kan. She comforted herself in her heart. If I think about it, it doesn't matter if the Grand Chief does not agree. It doesn't have much impact on the original plan. She can still understand the city on her own, understand the details of the devil, and get to know other witches. Although the other party refused her request, she did not impose any restrictions on her. She also said that she can apply to join the Witch Alliance at any time after changing her mind. She was going to do it alone, so maybe it would be better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the ears of Luo Jia’s head are erected again. She shook her tail and clenched her fists - yes! If the devil really has such a strong words, how can the great chiefs set the king here? If they come from the northwest, the first human city they meet is the winter city. If you are not sure of defeating the devil, you should not be farther away from the dangerous place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also say "I don't want you to die", it seems to be out of concern, in fact it may be just a swearing person. Before you fight, whoever lives and who is still alive! If she is really hurt, can the Grand Chief still kill Miss Nanava and refuse to treat her? In this way, this sentence is equivalent to self-sweeping face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Three Flames Princess felt that they were cheering up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has more than a hundred golden dragons on her body. Even if the cost of treatment is amazing, it is impossible to collect dozens of pieces at a time, including expenses such as eating, drinking, clothing, herbal medicine, and desert guides. It is no problem for one person to live for several years. She did not believe that without the support of the King of the Grey Fort, she could not find the trouble of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mind, Luo Jia suddenly felt a lot of peace of mind, she looked around and began to look at the horizontal cards on the surrounding houses - since I decided to slowly, The first thing to do is to find a place to settle down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it’s still early, she’s not in a hurry. After all, she has now successfully arrived in the west of the gray fort, and according to the habits of Mo Jinsha people, it should be celebrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
