			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two came to the square, the place was already crowded - this absolutely It’s not an exaggeration. It’s the first time that Snakes have seen so many people gathered in the same place. Even when the Long Song Fortress issued relief rations, there is no such amazing momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He roughly estimated that the number of people coming to watch the show is likely to exceed 5,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square has also become different from the original one. According to the locals, this is the third time. The vast flat land has become a giant bowl of submerged depression, and I heard what is called a stepped square. It is reasonable to say that such a huge project is difficult to do in a year or two, but it seems to be repaired within half a month, and no one has seen where the soil that should have been dug has gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, everyone can sit on the stone steps while watching the show, instead of standing on the legs and numb, the vision is much better, as long as you can grab Go to an open space. As for those who are late, they can only surround the square and pick up their toes to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, okay," the tiger claws squeezed into the last row of stone steps and forced out the position of two people. "Always caught up." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake's teeth are close to the chest, carefully sitting on the friend's seat - all the savings of his two months in the cloth bag of the chest, crowded in people In this case, you must be alert. If it is a long song, such a scene is undoubtedly a carnival of mice. Although there have been no rats in the Bianbu District, it is still necessary to be wary of the "temporary transfer". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last glimmer of sunset was covered by the night, there were only a few burning torches left in the square, the whole stage was dark, and there was no one to see who was coming. The bonfire - Snake teeth noticed that the center of the square was not prepared for the firewood pile, which made him feel a little strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to perform without fire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a cluster of bright light blooms on the stage, some dazzling, but soon the snake teeth adapt to it without a touch of softness. Then there is the second cluster, the third cluster, the stage is lighted a little, and the exclamation of the scene is also higher than a burst, like a wave of waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...the light of the factory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, my God, no night light! They brought the no night light here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary magical illuminator of the thunder in the sky, the crystal glass cover for imprisoning electro-optical light is of great value, and the snake tooth has only seen a few eyes when passing through the industrial zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is not a night light, it is called an electric light," someone around it disdains. "It consumes electricity, it is produced by a witch-made machine! Putting this stuff into every community, but the lady's ability seems to be unable to support such a large consumption, so only the factory is currently in use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you hear it from?" The tiger claw was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not a formal resident of Wintertown," the man shrugged. "The City Hall has made several publicity announcements, telling us how to use the lights correctly. To know that it is like a flame, improper contact can be a big disaster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a Thunder?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...the two are almost the same, do you manage so much. When you become a squatter, you will naturally understand the primary education class."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a way to quickly become a formal contributor? What is the elementary education class? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth still wants to ask a few more words, the crowd suddenly burst into a deafening cheer, and the tiger claws grabbed him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Star Flower Troupe debuted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Mey! Ms. Mey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Irene!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Gate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
