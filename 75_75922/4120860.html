			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although for a moment, he would like to vomit a sentence, "You are also a member of Tadalin? Disrespectful and disrespectful," but eventually he endured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, it’s still in the interrogation stage, and it’s too much to break the majesty. Moreover, in the state of spiritual resonance, the linker will transform each other's thoughts into a language that they can understand. If there is no corresponding vocabulary, they will choose the words that are as similar as possible, so even if it is a common statement, the expression is not necessarily the same. the meaning of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the devil did not answer his question, but fell into extreme contradictions-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, this doesn't make sense! You guys haven't entered the heavens and seas at all, how can you get the fragments? It's not in the field where you can go! But if not, why do we fail? Lies are lies." - I, Cabradaby never admits!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before interrogation, Roland knew that the beginning of the transformation was the most vulnerable stage of the devil, according to Zoe After being extracted by the magic core, it will cause great discomfort, so that it can't control your emotions and leak some news that is not easy to say. So he step by step, "Do you need me to remind you further? You want to ambush my army, but you are forced to show up and fight. If you are not close to the position, you will be killed and wounded. And you will try to save the defeat with your men. When you land, you will be hit by the goddess, and even yawn. I haven’t been able to support it. Now who beats you In front of you, as long as you think about it, you can fully see yourself from the perspective of her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You--"High-level devil His face became extremely ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exchange of consciousness is faster than everything. Apparently after hearing his words, Zoe has already shown the battle scene in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fact that you don't recognize or change your fiasco, you can see that the impossible in your mouth is, in the final analysis, just a joke." Roland said ironically, "No. If you step into the sky, you won't be able to get the fragments. You might as well talk about what it is. If you don't define it, how can I answer your doubts? Maybe in our eyes, it is not so precious."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are just teasing me, bugs," Kabradabi’s voice was full of anger, "the source of the battle of divineness, the key to determining the continuation and promotion of the race You actually said that it is not precious!?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa suddenly thought of something, "Wait, is it like a red crystal, the shape is sharp? The cone-shaped, if in deep contact, will be taken to an extremely empty hall and see some incredible sights?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The relics of the gods! Tilly also whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually call it a relic of the gods? It is a low-energy crawling species," the devil dismissed. "That is the inherent inheritance of the ethnic group. No--swallow it, the group will be upgraded; lose it, the group becomes the nutrients of other people! Now you know where your stupidity is? When the group of widows is destroyed, your crawling species are still shrinking to the surface, how May I touch this reward?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s heart jerked, which turned out to be the reason why the other person could not obtain debris or relics. As a total of four civilizations displayed in the picture, since the elimination of the family can capture the relics, human beings did not have the chance to obtain it. The underground civilization disappeared during the first war of gods. At that time, human beings were struggling with the devil. How can you participate in another battle of genocide? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and found that the expressions of the people were extraordinarily dignified and apparently realized the importance of this information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it confirms the Tacila witch’s previous speculation from the side--"Because a stone that doesn’t know what purpose, kills each other for hundreds of years? "God is too ruthless" - Roland remembers that Wendy has sent such feelings, but now it seems that the relics not only determine the survival of civilization, but also have immeasurable value to other competitors. Under this premise, it means that there is almost no possibility of reconciliation in the battle of divine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, from the point of view of the high-level devils, they are undoubtedly one of the beneficiaries of the upgrade. Although it is not clear about the specific process of devouring the relics, it can attribute the merits of evolution and new weapons to the relics, which makes Roland think of the inheritance of knowledge. Is the heterogeneous devil and giant skeleton that appeared in the glory scene related to the underground civilization? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
