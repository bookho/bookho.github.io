			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first "picture scroll" has the most rich content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a throne made up of blade and broken bones, with a red-blooded window and a towering black stone pillar on the back, which looks like a temple In part, if you put your consciousness into it, you can still see the spire city outside the window. The most striking of these is the half-arched stone arches - if the spires next to it are considered to be the residential buildings of Hermes, then the height of the stone gates is at least higher than the sum of the five cathedral towers, which is completely Violation of common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even more incredible is that the door is actually dark, nothing can be seen, as if there is a huge and smooth curtain in the middle of it, but carefully If you look at it, you will find that the darkness seems to be deep, and you can't find the bottom... The more you stare, the more creepy you will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consciousness of Jieluo only stayed out of the window for a little while, and then focused on the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no master of the throne today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content seen in my mind is not static. For example, sometimes she can see a warrior in armor sitting on the throne and her head styling The black helmet is covered with a slight red light from the eyelids. However, such scenes are rare. Most of the time, the seats are empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the history of the secret, the content of this scroll should point to the city where the devil originated, that is, where they first appeared - the northwest corner of the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo holds the same view on this, after all, the blood red and black stone spires in the picture are very similar to the living environment of the devil, the master of the throne The helmet also has a distinctive devil style. The only strange thing is that its body looks no different from ordinary people. It is not as strong and terrifying as the fear of the gods and the lord of hell, so it is the identity of it. There are countless speculations. Some popees think it is the source of evil, and some witches think that it is the guardian of the devil's family. It is the secret of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second "picture scroll" is much different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shows very little content and seems to be constantly moving. At least in the limited observations of Jieluo, I have never seen a repeating scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, she saw water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light blue water is swaying against the three huge skeletons, and there is nothing in the middle of the skeleton. The water splash seems to be isolated by an invisible barrier. I can't splash in at all. If you think of the huge skeleton as the keel that supports the sideboard, it feels like you are in the cabin and look out through the portholes. The difference is that these windows occupy almost the entire wall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo was quickly attracted to the wonderful scene... She was like being on the dividing line between water and sky, half sinking to the bottom, and half floating On the water. The top of the head can see dazzling sunlight and sparse clouds, while the bottom is surrounded by water. Under the light, she can clearly see the change in the color of the water, from the light blue of the outermost layer to the yellow-green, then to the dark green, the deeper the look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the picture slammed, and Jinglu felt a trembling in his feet and almost fell to the ground. She subconsciously wants to open her eyes, but she resists at the last moment—these are not real scenes, she tells herself, but the revelation of the gods in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water in front of the eyes rises rapidly and quickly submerges the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s not so much water is rising, it’s better to say that you are sinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the scene outside the window was covered by water, and she even saw the red fish swimming against the skeleton, first two or three, then more and more The dense, dense fish is like a red ribbon that wraps around an invisible barrier. The color of the water gradually changed from dark green to dull black. The final picture disappeared into the darkness of the fingers and disappeared completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo took a breath and broke free from the picture. This is the first time she has seen such clear information. At the moment when the darkness covers the line of sight, she feels I am about to suffocate in general. However, there is no useful clue in it. As far as the secret history is concerned, the content of the second painting is extremely variable. Some people have recorded a huge eyeball. Some people have seen volcanoes that emit bubbles and yellow smoke. Some people say that they have witnessed the bottomless abyss that emits a dark light. The views of previous observers have never been unified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
