			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beep...嘀."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he is still swearing, the phone has been Switched on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Why are you?" The voice over there was very impatient. "There is something to say, I am going out soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head and forced himself to condense his spirit. "Oh, that's it... I I just read this book, and its content is really..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stunning, right?" Garcia seemed to have expected his reaction. "The first time people look at it is basically like this, but it is fictitious. You won't think about it after you have a sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fictional "Roland frowned. "How do you say that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" literally," a sneer came from the receiver, "The volcano claimed the volcano The ruins were investigated and found to have been swallowed up by the magma two hundred years ago - it is an active volcano, although it has not been a major outbreak, it has not completely subsided for tens of thousands of years. Unless he can not know the prophet, or live For the last two centuries, I have to be afraid of high temperatures and smoke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person’s answer made him feel great After a short while, I asked, "So...the contents of the book are all compiled by him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real and false, I am right Archaeology has never been of much interest. The master also said that if he did not wear the clothes of the martial arts and died in the library of the association, the book would not even be included."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the association does not know his identity..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the author is more famous than the book, which is also considered It’s the unsolved mystery of the association. But don’t think that you can figure it out. Listen to my master and say that the entire archives have been turned over for the sake of this matter. In the end, it’s still not going to be?” Dao, "In short, there are so many rumors about this book. Have you finished? I have to hang up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, wait--"Roland I quickly said, "After you got this book... Have you seen it again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wanted to ask the paper directly, Eventually changed his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The way back is turned over, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, nothing... ... just want to ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咔嚓." The phone over there was hung up - apparently this almost teasing question made Garcia's patience exceed limit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two walls, he could hear the closing sound of 0827. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can't help but sigh, if it's not straight to the point, such a problem is useless except for the resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the book "The Reasons for Being" is only half written, and the red note is likely to be caught in the last few pages. Even if you read through it, you will not be sure to pay attention. Go to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I came back from the association to take the shuttle bus. It’s easy to know how serious it is to look at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter how the other party answers, it is impossible to judge that she has seen this note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No--it is definitely not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the character of Garcia, if you have seen it, you will never be indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that these two messages are either pranks or a kind of connector message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but have a thought that would rather be a prank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter may be too...is incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rationally, he prefers the latter - this book is not a top-secret document. Most of the martial artists borrowed it because of their fame. It is not surprising that one person does not find it. It is incredible that so many people are not aware of it. It is. Therefore, it is very likely that the note is not in the book at the beginning, but has only recently been put in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is this kind of rationality that makes him feel creepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; means the world of dreams - this illusion that he conceived, someone noticed his difference. Just like when dreaming, a certain character in the dream suddenly turned back and smiled at you with a sly smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland patted his cheek and pressed the chill in his heart. What a fear, he silently renewed his life, not to mention that these are only speculations for the time being. Even if it is true, as long as you leave here, the time of the whole world will be stagnant. Who else can threaten him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the message on the note is just waiting for a contact, not actively looking for it, which may also explain the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for where the Rose Cafe is, what it means to be in the world, or to the Takira witch to check it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not forget that there is still something to do next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up at the wall clock on the wall, after confirming the time, he took out the already prepared key from the bedroom and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to explore the memory fragments of the package, Roland has done a lot of preparations since the Tagela witch came, such as the key to each household door. A replica, also bought a violent unlocking tool from the Internet - after all, only he can see this "nothing" memory door, really can only lock up the sleeves themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not for the sake of the Grey Fort, this part of the exploration should have been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland went down to the fifth floor and quickly found room 0510. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time most people are taking a nap, the autumn sun shines like a lazy person, the entire corridor looks quiet and serene, and outside a street The car is in stark contrast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He inserted the key into the lock and turned it slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A weird scent suddenly poured into his nose, causing him to hold his breath involuntarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the dream world has reserved a place for the devil, but it has not corrected some details: such as body odor. In order to cover up the taste of itself, the use of perfume in large quantities has become a last resort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thoroughly searched the room in two minutes, confirmed that no one had locked the door, then took out the hydraulic shears in the backpack and went straight to the end of the walkway. Between things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This iron gate is one of the few that is locked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that although the things connected behind the door are inconspicuous, in the face of the physics sword modification, the door lock does not show any extraordinary. After a few seconds, the lock was broken into two pieces silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swallowed and pushed away the heavy door leaf-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Roland was seen The scene caught all eyes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to be standing on a cliff that is bottomless. The top of the cliff is ring-shaped, and the length is less than ten kilometers. It is almost impossible to see the opposite. This peculiar terrain surrounds an extremely magnificent lake in the mountains, but the flowing water in the lake is not a spring, but a dazzling red mist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the matte surface and the top is hundreds of meters. The probe looks down like a flash of red crystal, which is rich in shape. If it is not the occasional fog that rushes from the bottom and goes straight up the wind, forming a "fog column" standing on the sky, it is difficult for him to connect it with the dirty and dark "blood of blood". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
