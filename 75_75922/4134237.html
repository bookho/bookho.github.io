			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this distance is impossible to remind each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red dot is a bit faster and more vivid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, right - call! You can use the phone to inform the leaves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver followed the sliding stick all the way from the top of the tower to the underground conference room, shouting toward dawn dawn, "Call the leaves and let the leaves She immediately left her present position!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realized that something was going on, and the film didn’t ask why he brought up a phone and shook his hand. "Leave... Where to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where to go! No winter city, south of the forest... The farther away from the terminal, the better!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at this point everyone in the conference room focused on Sylvie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you find?" asked Itis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We guessed wrong - the enemy is heading for the leaves, and there is only one!" Sylvia looked anxiously in the southwest direction, "the leaves are in control In the forest, you need to concentrate. This is equivalent to the existence of an entity. As long as the enemy can see the flow of magic, you can determine her position! Let the fire set for the moment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Itis suddenly frowned. "Can you observe the devil's actions here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because each other's Magic...it is too strong," she murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The leaf can be very strong," said Fein. "If you don't rely on fire, even a madman can take her for a short time." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the enemy has done this, it is impossible to be unprepared--" Hilly couldn't help but hold the fist, the red dot in the field of vision It has started to rise sharply, and its trajectory is like a high-pitched snake head. "Isn't the phone still connected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...no one answered "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, the leaves are attracted to the attention by the fire? At this speed, there will be a maximum of one or two minutes, and the two will come into contact! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Recall the phone at the terminal," Isis said. "Let the first army stationed to inform the leaves and prepare them for reinforcements. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Film turned and swayed another phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this anxious wait, Sylvie clearly saw the red light falling over the apex and falling straight down, as if an ominous meteor . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unscrupulously launching a breakthrough from the sky...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has already vaguely guessed The worst answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy is probably - the demon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be fine, the leaves clap their hands and they breathe a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trees on the edge of the camp have been separated from the north, so that no matter how the fire burns, it will not threaten the safety of the terminal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing those twigs that distort in the flames, she still feels a little uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the burning of the wood under her control, how much memory will she lose? What is important and precious? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about such a problem makes people feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, prepare for the fire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quietly encouraged herself a few words, and was planning to go around the camp to see if there was anything I could do to help, the top of the head suddenly The whistle came from her attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves are looking up, and it is almost at night, the sky is dark purple, it is difficult to see what the sound is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be careful, get rid of it!" Suddenly someone shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No time to see who the speaker is, the leaves subconsciously sneak into the trees, at the same time, a black shadow descends from the sky, almost wiped her face The surrounding leaves are instantly turned into powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the black shadow landed did not make a loud noise, even can be said to be quiet, this strange scene made the leaves strong Uneasy feelings, but there is no time to move, a twisted ripple has spread around the black shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical movement that was originally running smoothly solidified for it--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it was like a mirror! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah----!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves only feel a bit of a turn, they are The irresistible force forced the trunk out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After falling heavily on the ground, she couldn’t help but feel a sweet throat, open her mouth, and spit out a blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, the leaves only see the true face of the shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a devil with a tall figure and a very sharp facial features. Apart from the dark blue skin and the weird costumes, it’s almost no different from humans. It just stood there, and it made people feel unspeakable pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the air has become sticky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves gasped for the body, no matter how they called in the bottom of the heart, the forest did not respond to her will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of being forced to break the connection with the heart of the jungle is not the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Devil..." Her heart sank to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party neither sneered nor screamed, just sticking out the sharp claws like a blade, and leaping to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves clenched their teeth and closed their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the sting in the expectation did not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"叮!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange sword with a strange shape is in front of her, alive Blocking the other's claws - the blade that is as thick as the door panel, and the golden sun mark on the sword, once you have seen it, you will never forget it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Easy Messenger". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your opponent is here, monster!" After the ashes picked up the claws of the demon, they stood in front of the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gray, Ash?" The leaves widened their eyes in surprise. "Are you not returning to the Winter City with the Temple of Tilly? I saw the seagull with my own eyes." No.-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, this should be the case," Ashes did not return. "But I think this fire is really awkward and it takes the initiative. The application has stayed. After all, once I get out of the situation, I can help, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original warning, the previous warning, is also her from! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, is this the demon who you have encountered?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but you have to be careful, it is much stronger than the high-end devil in the past!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
