			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the center of the main hall of the ruins, the illusion instrument has been fully opened, the magic is filled, and the core emits a cold purple light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as long as the instruction is issued, it can send the light curtain to thousands of miles away, which completely exceeds the limit of the witch’s ability, and is the power directly given by the gods. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Pasha looked into the eyes, all the sarcomas fell to the surface, and the gods prayed the most serious look, standing side by side, dead mixed species of evil beasts Deliberately piled on both sides, the light blue blood reflects a little plaque under the reflection of purple light, which is gloomy and terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that group of mortals, will be shocked by this hellish scene... right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa does not want this - the body of the evil beast will leave a sticky residue, not only difficult to remove, but also emits a disgusting stench. God can not smell the witch, but she can feel it with the tentacles. For four hundred years, this hall has already been the same as their home. Who would be willing to make a mess in their own hall? But she must be prepared for the worst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is that Felice is in danger and the ring is not broken by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this happens, it is necessary to create the most horrible atmosphere to intimidate and deter those who are disadvantaged to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fortress West is close to the entrance to the Fertile Plains and will undoubtedly suffer from the lost beasts every year. Regardless of whether the film is a witch or a mortal, it should be able to see from the mixed-body corpses piled up behind them that they are definitely not provoked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only by making the other person aware of the powerful power of the Tacila survivors can they gain time for the next rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Activate the instrument," said Celine. "In any case, we must first discover the situation of Felice."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passa gave a point to the master and gave instructions to the instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, everyone felt that the light around them was a little dim, and a huge purple light curtain shrouded the entire hall, the other end of the phantom instrument. There is a scene where the colorful magic stone is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa couldn’t help it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is neither a dark dungeon nor a wilderness in the wild, but a bright lobby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear window in the lobby, a long wooden table with white cloth in the center, and flowers and teacups on the table, without any traces of fighting. It is like deliberately choosing to destroy the magic stone in this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis is standing by the window, chatting with another witch, seeing the light curtain appear, she turned her head and looked quite awkward Surprised, "You are... what happened? Is the hall being attacked by the evil beast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Pasha paused, she suddenly I feel that the situation of the other party seems to be different from what I envisioned. Felice does not seem to have been attacked or tortured, nor is it in danger, but rather radiant, actually more spiritual than when she left. After a careful look, it was discovered that Felice was no longer wearing a vulgar and cheap maid's clothing, but a delicate fluffy robes. Under the backdrop of gorgeous clothes, her temperament was better than it was at the beginning. It’s a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction of other partners is also not so good. Everyone has been facing each other for a long time, and no one has answered it - but after turning into a sarcoma, I can’t see the expression, otherwise The atmosphere will be very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The evil beast has indeed launched a large-scale offensive recently, but you can rest assured that the core of the magic and the relics of the gods are safe and sound, and everyone has a lot." Pasha, the first person to adjust to the wind and the waves, "just has too many bodies, we have not had time to clean it up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... ?? Felice reveals a suspicious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, cough..." Pasha waved his whiskers toward the gods behind him. "Okay, everyone will continue to clean up the remains of evil beasts. Try to throw them all out of the maze before they stick to the floor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
