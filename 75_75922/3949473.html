			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had not felt such warm sunshine for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia stood in the garden and took a deep breath, the smell of rosemary drifted into her nose with the breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the kingdom of the winter, the north of the land except the cold wind, frozen soil and unfragrant winter flowers, nothing. In the backyard of the castle, the meat and the intestines to be dried are always hung, and the strong smell is lingering. It is not a clear water port here. There is no familiar salty and humid in the wind. I can't hear the sound of sea water rushing to the beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Grey Castle Palace, she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...there is a little different from what looks in memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia sat down at the central flower pond, stroking the slightly rough stone bricks - since childhood, he has been playing hide and seek here, and his forehead is lying At the edge of the flower pond, after the blood flowed, his father knocked out all the stone bricks and replaced them with smooth pebbles. In this way, although there will be no more injuries, there is no way to hide the figure as a covering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, she remembered that in addition to herself, there were also Goron and Tefko. When they saw their sister fall, they were scared one by one. I stopped crying, and even imitated the appearance of my fall, and slammed my head on the edge of the flower pond. Of course, afterwards, they did not despise their father’s embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a passage that Garcia thought would never be recalled, like the secret buried under the tree, buried deeply. But when she returned to the old place, she found that the picture did not fade at all, and it was still vivid after being cut out from the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have returned to childhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is your world," a strange voice rang from behind. "It is a good choice as a place to sleep."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia turned back and saw a white woman coming out from the flower pond. She had a pair of light red eyes and long white hair, and the facial features were as refined as the fine art. Generally speaking, the sound is ethereal and pleasing to the ear, such as the gods who fall into the mortal world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of the clear water queen is completely gloomy, "You are the witch of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Called Jielu, the word witch is not suitable for me.” She chuckled. “I am called pure, not the same as those who have fallen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Pure people? But it is the plaything of the church," Garcia said coldly. "What is this scene? Is your ability to create a fantasy?" She suddenly picked up a stone and squeezed it in her hand. "It’s just a illusion! It’s all lie to me!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen’s snoring is far away, but there is no change in the scene before, the stone is also Without breaking the sound, she was cut through the hard edges and corners. Spreading his hand, there was a painful feeling in the worn wound, clear and true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can be seen that you are not ignorant of the witch's ability, which is much easier to do," Jielu lifted the skirt and shook his body. "Welcome to the world of consciousness, I call it the battlefield of the soul. We will fight here to kill, the winner gets everything, the loser loses everything... just like the gods recorded in the holy book."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soul... battlefield? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiacia groaned, suddenly felt a heartbreaking pain coming from the heart, Jie Luo did not know where to take a pistol, directly pierced Her chest. Breathing suddenly became difficult. She opened her mouth and wanted to yell, but she couldn’t make a little sound. The other side reversed the gun and slammed it back. The blood spurted out with the tip of the gun, and soon she splashed half of her. Body. Garcia fell to the ground, shaking and trying to cover the wound, and a lot of blood loss made her consciousness gradually blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, she found herself still standing in the same place, and her body was intact. The shadow is also standing a few meters away from her, just as the other party has never left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened? Garcia's mouthful of gasping, hallucinations? She grabbed the violent chest and the place where she was pierced was still aching. Bowing her head, there is a large pool of blood scattered at her feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
