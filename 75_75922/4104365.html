			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you asking?" Achille squinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Books..." Wendy took her hand with some concern. If Tilly is right, these people are not even directed at the winter city, but the differences that have already existed inside the island witch. If it is not handled well, it will not only involve the Witch Alliance, but also reduce the trust of newcomers to them, so that it will not be worth the loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing," the latter raised an eyebrow at her and then pointed to the witch who wanted to return to the East. "If you are worried about your hometown, It should not be abandoned by the family, but under the pressure of the church, it is necessary to leave the east and follow other escapers to sleep on the island. Am I right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What is it?" Ajima replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation in the East is like this," faced the aggressiveness of the red-haired witch, the book did not care, "Since the water queen Queen Garcia ransacked the sea breeze After the county and Jinsuicheng, the land has not recovered. First, the spread of the evils spread by the church, and then Fei Teke was messed up, the fields were deserted, and they were unable to make ends meet. Many people became refugees."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch’s face showed a clear color of concern, and Ajima still insisted, “Do not look at it with your own eyes, who knows if you are telling the truth? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before two years ago, Roland’s squadron launched the Refugee Containment Program. Now the population of No Winter City has exceeded 100,000, of which more than 70% are from ash. All over the fortress, especially the refugees in the east and south.” The book says in an orderly manner, “The relatives you are familiar with are probably also among them – can you tell me where you lived? Town or village, around There are any unique landscapes and outputs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to find her family with this clue? She is not a child born in a big city. Every street around it has a name. Every neighbor knows each other. What!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book did not answer, but gathered the hair and looked at the witch with encouragement, as if waiting patiently in class The answer is average. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My village...no name," hesitated for a long time, and the other party whispered. "There are no nearby villages. It is far from Jinsuicheng." As far as home, if you want to sell wheat, you can only sell it to the travel traders at a low price. If you have to say something, some people who have gone out call it 16."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten...six?" Wendy did not consciously repeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because they returned from Jinsucheng, the 16th village they passed was home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The book closed his eyes and slowly asked, "Let me think about it... There is a tributary of the Sanwan River behind the village, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In the east, the tributaries of the Sanwan River are everywhere." Achima snorted. "Without river irrigation, how can the village take root?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"But that's different," the book waved. "It's shallow and narrow, not only can't pass the boat, it will even reveal the riverbed during the dry season, which is why the village built by it can't transport food through the waterway." - Only when it reaches the village of No.16, the tributaries will come to an abrupt end and become a huge lake. Even if the water is cut off, the lake will not dry up. Therefore, the wheat fields in the village always grow more lush than other villages. Wrong?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch couldn’t help but widen her eyes, “Have you been there?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard people mention it," the book silenced the small meeting. "The man is now without a winter city, but he is not a resident of the 16 villages."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still ask him personally," she turned to look at the City Hall clerk responsible for registration, "Watt , ID number 0025478, kiln workers, should now recover waste slag in the No. 2 area of ​​Beipo, to bring him over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, adults. "The latter went away." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the clerk led a red-faced man to the residential area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
