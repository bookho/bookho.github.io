			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yuanwang carries the Wendy and Sylvie flying to the whirlpool, lightning Fly with Mai Mai on both sides of the basket and wait for the two to be picked up at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time their mission is not to investigate the devil camp, naturally it does not need to fly so high, as long as the snow mountain is blocked, Sylvia can penetrate the shore On the side of the rocky cliff, look straight at the eyes of the black stone tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Ai Gesha, the eye magic does not need to really "see" the other party, as long as someone notices it, it can sense the existence of the other party at the same time. And to locate the location, this devil has caused great casualties to the squadron's assault troops - whether it is stealth sneak or descend from the sky, it is difficult to avoid its investigation. Unless you are blindfolded, you can't be alarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it doesn't matter if you don't look at it, but the eyes are usually attached to the highest point in the camp. It's hard not to notice it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, what have you seen?" Lightning flew over and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to get closer, or I won’t hold on for a long time," Hilley blinked, and the Eye of Magic was struggling to penetrate the obstacle. And the scope of observation will be shortened. She has carefully gathered the sight of the investigation into a straight line, but when the details of the section in the cliff are displayed one by one, I still feel dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Wendy evoked a gust of wind, "Hurry up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rocky beach is a little bit clear, and the thin red mist is also appearing in front of everyone. Even if it is clear skies, the mist is still on the cliff, but the color is much lighter than the last time I saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi looked at it again, the soil in the field of vision was finally replaced by a thick mist, and a tower-like building was seen in the red mist. , like an abandoned world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly found the most sturdy Blackrock spire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was deliberately compared to the last mistaken accident - to alarm the devil and lure them to pursue. Sylvie doesn't want to be an explorer. Unlike lightning, a little girl who is full of energy, she just wants to live a life of mundane life, but she can't escape the destiny. Even if she doesn't like twists and turns, she can't stay out of it. Just as she would agree to Tilly to go to Bianbu Town and observe whether Roland was controlled by the witch. When Roland announced the plan, she only hesitated for a moment and promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she was to sleep all the sisters of the island, and this time for the Witch Alliance and the entire kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi took a deep breath and moved the line of sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, hundreds of eyeballs appeared in her view--black soft monsters still linger in the old place, as if they had never been moved, even Its limbs are fused with the top of the tower, which is like stretching out of the stone. The dense eyeballs deflected at the same time, and Sylvie could even see his face reflected from the dark eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling made her creepy, and the chill of her back instantly climbed to the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are coming!" she shouted at the interruption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷!" McMurray turns into a huge beast, A roll steadily stopped under the basket, and Hilli jumped down and landed on her spacious back, while the lightning bolted up with Wendy and flew to the lost forest. Compared to the last panic, this time they are completely prepared - the empty hydrogen balloon will be the goal to guide the two sides to meet, then according to the plan, lightning will return to this place alone, to lure the devil to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this gap, Hillvi turned and looked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five black spots above the cliff, which is more than Aeger’s prediction, but it does not exceed the warning red line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
