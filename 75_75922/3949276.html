			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter Lannis saw this battle for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge lineup of more than 300 knights, even the side of the line of defense did not touch, it has collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the end, they did not enter the 50-meter range - it was the firing line of the Musketeers under the Royal Highness, only when they crossed the 50-meter line, all the talents Allow fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four artillery pieces contain their opponents in the vicinity of the 100-meter line. In the 150-100-meter range, there are twenty bodies lying in the horizontal, and these people, like themselves, are skilled knights. Otherwise, they can’t control the horses in the roar of gunfire. Go forward at high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter is glad that he is not one of them. He faintly foresaw that the future wars will become very different, and Roland Wimbledon, who has such a powerful force, is also a matter of time to win the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few people in the First Army saw dizziness, vomiting and other adverse reactions after seeing the fierce battlefield, but because they were not close to each other, the artillery killed the enemy. The feeling is less than the use of the blade to kill the enemy, the reaction symptoms are not serious. From the team, Carter picked out a group of hunters who used to see the dead limbs and blood, collected the dead for the dead, and searched for people who were still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun gradually fell into the mountains, Carter stared at the bloody red sky, and the crows in the distant woods, he suddenly felt a bit bleak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The era of the Cavaliers is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Lane has not been able to return to the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t understand how he lost, obviously the line of defense was as thin as a flap, as long as it was lightly smashed, the knights saw the devil Scattered. He can't even blame others, because the one who rushes to the front is the elite knight of his knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro-guards cut down a few people before they let the mercenaries swarm away from the position of the Duke, but that’s all, no matter how he growls, They are unable to close the defeated subordinates. In desperation, the Duke of Osmond Ryan had to retreat as the flow of people, this retreat is nearly ten miles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the night came, the Duke chose to camp near the river bank, and the lost knights and mercenaries came close to the torch, but still most people The whereabouts are unknown. To make matters worse, when the retreat, the free people did not hesitate to leave the cart and food, so tonight they had to slaughter a few horses to serve as rations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the camp's largest tent, five nobles gathered in a group, looking pale to the Duke of Lane, and the latter's face was not much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can talk about what new weapons they use? The distance is farther than the bow, and unlike the trebuchet, the stone thrown can be seen." Block," he glanced at Rennes Meade. "You were at the forefront. Do you see anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, I... Not quite sure," Ryan held his head. "I only heard the roaring sounds, and they fell down in batches, especially the last one. The knight who rushed to the first place suddenly seemed to hit a block. On the invisible wall, I saw that his body was shaking, his head and his arms were split, just like..." He thought about it, "The eggs that were thrown from the top of the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a witch?" The Earl of Elk whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible," said the Duke, frowning. "The knights under my hands are wearing the stone of the gods, and the witch can't hurt them. You are not." Have you ever played a witch, what is the difference between them and ordinary women in front of the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, adults," Ryan suddenly remembered what it was like, " Before I heard the loud noise, I saw that there were several cart-like things in their queue. There were huge iron pipes in the car, which could emit red light and smoke."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Iron tube? Red light and smoke? Isn't that a bucket?" Earl of Elk wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke certainly knows what the bucket is. In the past, only the Wangdu nobles used it during major celebrations. Now the local lords are basically prepared one or two. . There is a pair of bronze ritual barrels in his castle, which can be blasted after being put into the snow powder. But the sound is far from the thunder of today’s heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
