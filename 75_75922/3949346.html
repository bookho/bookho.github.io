			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the summer comes, Margaret’s river fleet arrives in Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland specifically hosted a businesswoman at the dock to see the goods she brought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is the whole three ships of saltpeter. Now the gunpowder in Bianbu Town is basically exhausted, and even the first army's shooting practice has stopped. Although the revolver rifle has begun to be equipped with small-scale equipment, it only stays on the practice of bomb retreat, gun maintenance and reloading ammunition. Now with this batch of saltpeter, it is finally possible to resume live-fire shooting training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to saltpeter, she also brought in two ships of ingots, mainly iron and copper, and some green ore, which are unloaded. It will take two or three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also placed two steam engines in a prominent position on the yard, and put on red satin as usual, tied with red flowers for Margaret acceptance. In fact, Xijing Industrial Company has only put together a steam engine in the past month, which is based on hundreds of scrapped parts, so Roland had to let Anna go out, and those who are not too biased The parts were reworked to allow the second steam engine to catch up with the scheduled delivery time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Roland was that Margaret didn’t come alone this time, she also brought the merchant group of Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After delivery of the goods, Margaret and his group followed Roland back to the castle and enjoyed a sumptuous lunch in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, this is Hogg, my old friend, and one of the best mining businessmen in the king." Margaret introduced one by one, "This It is Jiamo, and Marlan belongs to the Yueyuewan Caravan. It is mainly engaged in cross-sea trade between the Grey Fort and the Fjord. They are very interested in the steam engine. I have known them for many years and I am sorry to sell them to them. So bring them to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask you, Dear His Royal Highness," with a big belly and a shiny face Tao, "Listen to Margaret, this machine can replace manpower, quickly pumping water from the mine and transporting mines, but also endless, no need to rest all day? Can I see it with my own eyes?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Roland sipped the wine. At first he couldn't adapt to the sour taste. Now he is getting used to it. "But I want to let it carry the ore. I have to install the rail system. After lunch, I can take you to the north slope mine to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I am very curious about the steam engine you describe. Can it really be installed on a sailboat instead of a sail to drive the boat forward?" Marr Lan said, "If it is a big ship like a sea boat with three to four miles? It might not be enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The steam engine and the horse Similarly, some strengths are strong, and some strengths are small, depending on the model at the time of manufacture. Of course, the machines with large output are naturally more expensive. And one is not enough, but the above two, the last four." Roland Answered with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting the steam engine on board, even the most original paddle steamer, is a complex system involving power, transmission and handling. There is no other place besides Bianbu Town. Have the technical strength of modification. And to renovate such a ship, the cost will inevitably exceed the steam engine itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, the Chiyuewan caravan also wants to order this machine from you." Jiamo forked a newly-opened buns and stuffed it into his mouth. The fragrant gravy was so hot that it narrowed its eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough things to gather together, people to group, big dog friends or dog big households, even the actual effect is not seen, just make a decision, simply as if not Qianjinlong is in the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head. "Unfortunately, there is not enough manpower in Bianbu Town, and the steam engine is very complicated to manufacture. It is very difficult to make a decision before completing Margaret’s order. Extra machine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can provide you with the man, Dear His Royal Highness," Gamore patted his chest, "either a carpenter or a blacksmith, or even It’s a shipbuilder, there are a lot of people in my port, and I don’t have to pay for it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And then let them learn the manufacturing method for you?” Hogg interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
