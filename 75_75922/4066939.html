			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... awakening?" Evelyn was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In all likelihood," Lily nodded. When she first awakened, the magic gathered in the body, which was equivalent to a counterattack. The pain was far worse than scratching the scalp. of. Many witches often unconsciously exert their abilities at this moment, and are the most easily exposed moments. If two or three years ago, the public awakened people almost ended up with only one dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electro-optic quickly disappeared, but the floor and exterior walls of the classroom were ignited by this cymbal, leaving the orange-red trajectory gradually rising to the open flame and taking the risk There was a thick smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl braced back to the partner who had been scared, and yelled twice, then grabbed her wrist and dragged the other person out of the danger zone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lily applauded and raised her eyebrows - knowing that the first phasing is not terrible, but it is also an unprecedented experience, often endless after the end of the counterattack Cold feelings of cold sweat. Being able to control the body in this state has not forgotten the companion behind him, and it is very rare for a girl of ten years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire spreads not fast, after all, the fire caused by the discharge is very narrow, and when the second half of the classroom is gradually swallowed by the fire, everyone has already withdrawn from the teaching building. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the truth, Axia ended the retrospective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, we have another sister," Lily raised her mouth, and it is foreseeable that the other person is still a pretty good guy, no Talk about your ability, at least brave and will. When she saw her, she felt that not all witches were as bad as mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, she deliberately looked at the mystery moon, but found the latter a shocked appearance, apparently did not notice what she was talking about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃... What happened to this idiot? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have to tell Wendy sister!" Amy proposed. "There is a new witch in the winter city!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agree," Evelyn nodded. "Let's go to the castle now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter would have known it for a long time. Lily shrugged, but she didn't say the idea. Anyway, after the end of the stroll, she also planned to go back to the bedroom to continue to observe the tiny insects, just by the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mystery Month?" When everyone walked to the door, they discovered that the mystery month was still in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah... I am coming," she said, screaming at the footsteps of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you alright?" Evelyn touched her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing..." The mystery whispered back, and the excitement before the arrival was like two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a mysterious guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lily pouted, took her hand and injected the "mother" into her body. Although the idiot will not be infected with the cold, but ... in case of an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people took the magical ark back to the Witch Building, and after reporting the matter to Wendy, it was the blame of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you still need to explore the truth? Sylvie found the magical reaction of the college district in the castle, and everything was known in the past. Wendy reached out and knocked on everyone's forehead. "Sneak through the cordon, sneak into a potentially dangerous place. You are close to lightning. - Do you want to be locked up?" A comprehensive set of test questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people changed their minds and quickly shook their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, I almost forgot," Evelyn suddenly claped. "Before eating dinner, I have to check the inventory of the pub first." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I also have a problem to ask Isabella," Maggie deeply bowed, "first, first retire."
