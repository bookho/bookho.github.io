			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a prophecy about the Red Moon?" The diffuse star sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also part of it. Since you mentioned it, let’s start with it," the young squat smiled and got up and poured him down. Cup of tea, this move made the bachelor quite flattered, compared to the experience of meeting with Fefco, Roland is undoubtedly much more approachable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The rumors about the Red Moon, to be said more than a thousand years ago, there was neither a Grey Fort nor a Wimbledon." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But now, there is a documented history, and now only four hundred and fifty years..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Not without a record, but was deliberately concealed," Roland changed his seat in a comfortable position. "It's still a long time, let me tell you slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next bachelor heard an incredible and amazing story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has crossed the uninhabited wild land, dating back to the twilight collars of thousands of years ago, the war of human beings with the devil, the symbol of the Red Moon and the witch empire, And the origins of the four kingdoms and churches... If this is not a king, he will certainly be a ridiculous talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no joke in the other person’s expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland concluded his statement, the diffuse star felt that his breathing was much more difficult. He always thought that the last day was the punishment of the gods. The sea set off waves, the earth. Trembling and cracking, the fire of the earth and the thunder, although terrible, will not let all humanity perish. As long as you prepare in advance, you can even save a considerable number of cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in his statement, the Red Moon is actually the signal that the Devil is attacking? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this thousands of years of conquest, humanity has failed twice, and once again defeated, it will be completely eliminated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty..." The sound of the diffuse star is hoarse. "Where did you know this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "The Witch Empire and the Church," Roland extended two fingers. "The establishment of the four kingdoms is related to them. The Grey Fort is no exception. In addition, I have dealt with the devil in the west of the West." They have their own civilizations and army, and they are veritable aliens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... what is the smile of the gods?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one knows, maybe the answer can only be found after the end of the battle of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diffuse star is silent, he doesn't know Should not believe this horror, but soon thought that this is related to the survival of the Grey Fort, and the continuation of the Wimbledon family, Roland as the monarch should not deceive himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that makes no sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take these as true, then your attitude towards witches can be fully explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of them is not from the devil's words, then nature is no longer the enemy of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the sinlessness of the witches that the old kings have circulated is only a small part of the truth that has come to the surface. His Majesty did not release all the news. It is very cautious to hide the facts that are easy to cause panic. This is undoubtedly correct and sensible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he can’t understand how the red moon in the sky is related to the gates of hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, what can I do for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diffuse star faintly realizes that the king Several times, the astrological association is required to move to the west. It is probably not for the divination. He knows more about the Star of the World than the astrologers. If you don’t say this secret, the bachelor’s life will be I can't imagine what happened thousands of years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the second question I want to talk to you, it is even more important than the first one," Roland smiled and pulled a table from the table. The book was handed to him, "Let's see this first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resolve...geometry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading is very ridiculous, and the pigment used in the title is actually blue - so the smooth and delicate blue enamel is not cheap . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not a problem to just flip it over and not understand. There are still many things that you need to master in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The diffuse star does not want to read at night, although the candle is not seen in the room, the light source above the head is exceptionally stable, but the brightness is always not as good as during the day... This still has some damage to vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing for stargazers to protect is the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the other party is a king. He really refuses to do so. He plans to pretend to read it and wait until tomorrow to read it carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just after opening the first page and sweeping the prologue, he forgot his original thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use arithmetic to describe the trajectory of an object? As long as you know the key parameters, you can calculate the whole picture of the trajectory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is a series of horizontal and vertical lines, each cross pattern is painted with a simple figure, some is a slanted line, some is a curve, and There are ellipse and multi-segment curves, but at first glance there is nothing strange, but his gaze is attracted by the arithmetic of one side of the graph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That should be an arithmetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diffuse Stars, it has a plus sign, has an equal sign, starts with the same symbol, ends with the same symbol, clearly does not understand the meaning, but I feel inexplicably wonderful. This sense of coordination seems to be innate, and each symbol has a unique charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and clearly that each graphic is very different, such as lines and ellipses, can not be regarded as a type of trajectory, but their arithmetic is not too big difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly raised an uncontrollable idea in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the graphics in the world can be expressed in a calculation formula? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bachelor with excitement can't wait to open the second page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the diffuse star closed the book, I found that my neck was sore Incomparably, I obviously saw more than half an hour, and my Majesty did not bother him, but continued to write the manuscript at hand, and looked very serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, Your Majesty, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reading?" Roland looked up and smiled. “There are a lot of places that can't be understood right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, these symbols, and some expressions, are not those taught in the court... ..." Nine of the ten court mentors came from astrological associations, but the things written by His Majesty were completely beyond his imagination. "It's very interesting, and I can't figure out the interchangeable computing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you haven't touched the equation and want to understand the parsing part, you have to learn this first," the king said, like a juggling trick, and pulled a stack of books from the table and handed it to him. The title above is blue, and some are green, and the name is still weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hands of the diffuse star trembled slightly. "Can I bring them back to see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Of course," Roland nodded. "In fact, it's not just you. I hope that all astrologers and disciples can learn this together." He paused. "The second thing I want to say is this, you." You don't have to worry too much about the Red Moon. Only by mastering them all, the astrological association can play an irreplaceable role in the future war against the devil. This part of the book is only enlightenment, and there is more profound content behind it, not just sports. Tracks, they can even describe a grass and a tree, describe the stars in the sky, describe everything you see. How, are you willing to accept it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am willing, sire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
