			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soli.Dal sat across the broken castle door with satisfaction and walked into the cold Inside the castle of Windy Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days to win the cold wind ridge? Aside from the time spent on the road for two days, he broke through the wall of the town in only a quarter of an hour - of course, the mud fence that is only one person tall is not a problem. There were few guards standing guard, and they were scattered after being dismissed by the trial army. There was almost no formal resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the town that guards the frontiers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort Kingdom is no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that made him dissatisfied was that when the church army was still halfway up the mountain, the beacon under the feet had a thick smoke, as if they were expected to come. The same as attacking the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s a matter of time to let the other territories in the North see the alarm, this awe-inspiring practice still makes him angry - to advance the holy city The team is regarded as an enemy, indicating that they have long been guilty. He has sent a small team of judges to the beacon tower, ready to take these people to question and then send the gallows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please go here, adult," the knight who led the way trembled. When the sword was placed around the neck of the group, the knights did not show the great meaning of protecting the lord, but immediately surrendered and declared that they were willing to be loyal to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ugly state of the unbelievers, cowardly, helpless, and worthy of mentioning the trial warrior fighting for the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After killing several guards along the way, the trial army broke into the lord’s study and blocked any window that might escape. Lee felt that the other party did not have the courage to jump off the window to escape. He slowly stepped into the room, looking at the pale chilly lord lord a little soft on the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Kay. Marton."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, how dare you dare Good at the cold winds...The holy city is difficult, do you want to be openly opposed to the gray fort?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is finished, Soli thinks, fear is completely deprived His mind. Defending the evil spirits on the Hermes defense line for decades, the Archbishop honed a unique ability, that is, the taste of fear. Some people can turn fear into a life-saving **, and some people will only be swallowed up by fear. The former is the necessary quality to judge the warrior to be promoted to the gods, and the latter will be eliminated by the endless bloody battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kafon is clearly the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you didn't know this already?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? No! I don't understand what you mean by saying--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s late to regret it, adult," Sorley interrupted. Don't tell merchants to go to the holy city, don't tell me that you just do this whimsy... The King of Grey Castle wants to turn the cold wind ridge into an outpost for the attacking holy city. Naturally, we can't blame us for launching a counterattack in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are accused of no reason!" Kaifeng shook his head again and again. "I didn't do these things at all. The king never sent messengers to the cold wind, let alone Actively attacking Hermes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if you don't admit it, there is a way for Pope to know what to look for from your head." But it doesn't really help you in that step, so you still have to explain everything you know now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& "I, I really haven't done this, you can't yell at me!" His fat body shrank back and forth. "I am the lord of the Windwind Ridge, the Earl of the Grey Fort Kingdom! Your actions have been violated." "Evil moon convention!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough, this is what you are looking for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Li Daer waved his hand in annoyance, and the trial warrior immediately dragged him out of the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop sat down on the seat of the lord and vaguely felt that something was wrong. The lord clearly has been destroyed by fear, why is it still dead and biting? Is he so arrogant to Roland Wimbledon, rather being taken to the Holy City for interrogation, and not willing to put the King’s plan out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
