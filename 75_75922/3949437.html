			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long Song Fortress, Drama Theatre Performance Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the whistle and cheers of the audience, the curtain slowly fell. Mey wiped the sweat on his forehead and looked at Irene, who was excited and looking forward, and bowed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will definitely make Eileen cheer, and when the curtain falls, she can't help but rush to come and grab the Mey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha, can I really do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good annoyance, Mey Turning her eyes and pushing her away, "It’s still some progress, and it can be staged independently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Mey, then... me? "Another witch actor, Luo Xia, asked carefully." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are still very far away," she said without hesitation. "The expression is stiff, the movement is slow, the lines are not infused, and the second act is committed." In the wrong place, the fourth act made a mistake. This is a typical unseen script."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, Miss Mey is really strict," I touched the back of the head. "But the audience's response seems to be very good. You listen, the applause has not subsided yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The majority of these people have never entered Through the theater's civilians, the drama is a new thing for them," Mey bluntly said. "If it is a normal performance, the mistakes made enough for the nobility to scream." She paused. "If you want to be an actor." If you go down this road, don't be satisfied with the success of the moment. Only by constantly improving yourself can you gain a foothold on the stage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, thank you The guidance!" All the people bowed their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei sighed and came again, clearly that he could not be regarded as a drama instructor for this group of people. However, she is too lazy to care about this small matter. "Okay, keep working hard. "Witch Diary" has been scheduled for September, and we have several rounds to play. This is a rare opportunity, don't miss it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei received a notice from the Ministry of Education one month ago, let All members of the crew went to the Changge Fortress for performances. The so-called all members are the few actor who followed her to the border, plus Irene Hilter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the prince and his agent Pelos reached an agreement, the theater specifically cleared out a series of slots for the crew to perform "Witch Diary" trilogy. As a result, the actor who is not a good performer and even a newcomer can't be counted on the big stage of the Fortress Theatre. In exchange for the usual, they are not likely to be selected even if they are a supporting role. Now they are appearing as important characters, and they also perform together with themselves as the stars of the West. They have to sigh the fate. Impermanence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the background, Mayi could not help but frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a group of people in the lounge noisy, seemingly arguing about something, seeing Mei Yi and his party appear, more than a dozen people led by a woman The next round came up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are actors in the theater, and the leading woman, Mayi, also knows that Bella Dean is a little-known actor and herself. Belong to different groups. There have been some nobles who think she is the biggest competitor of the Star of the West, but in fact, whether it is acting or fame, he has always firmly pressed the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Guess what I saw?" Bella bypassed Mey and walked over to Irene step by step. "A group of stolen feet from the small places in the country." Actor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" Irene wondered, and Gat and Rocha and others looked stiff and couldn't help but step back two steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Bella murmured. "Look, she still doesn't know her identity." The words caused a burst of laughter." Then I will just say it, the big city like the Long Song Fortress is not the place you should come, but the Fortress Theatre also does not welcome these inferior and vulgar third-rate performances. What the witch diary is just the struggle and mourning of several funeral dogs. Who would be interested in watching this kind of disgusting drama? It is better to roll back to the border town earlier."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hah, the audience?” Bella sneered disdainfully. “Do you call the people who deal with mud, hoes, and kiln every day to call the audience? Don’t laugh at my big teeth! Just grab a few monkeys and go for a lap, they also Would you cheer aloud! If it’s not free, will they have free time to watch your performance?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I...” Irene opened her mouth, but not Know how to refute it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The theater has been down for several consecutive quarters in order to arrange your performances three times a week, even we have been affected - as long as you are in line with your drama Together, the nobility would not come to see it!” Bella raised her voice. “Who would be willing to sit on a chair full of mud and oil? If it is me, I don’t want to step into it after a group of countrymen’s carnivals. The terrible theater."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is obviously looking for a sly, Mey thought, the sudden insertion of the town crew did squeeze out a lot of people’s opportunities. But Bella Dean has not been affected too much. From the news that some acquaintances have heard, after leaving the long song fortress, the theater intends to make her a new star of the West, and it is naturally impossible to cancel the drama she starred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the purpose of Bella’s action is obvious. She seems to be yelling at Irene and others, actually actually targeting herself - if these people retreat, they can't play the witch diary alone, and they can only return to Bianbu Town. In this way, she is equal to defeating herself in the frontal confrontation, and also by chance to resume the opportunity of other actors to play, the prestige will inevitably rise, thus laying the status of a new generation of Western Star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she never makes herself a stepping stone to others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The theater revenue is falling, are you serious?" Mey turned and casually said, "Because the ticket is not allowed to make the theater unable to make ends meet, why do you get it?" Such a naive assertion. The theater operator has undoubtedly reached an agreement with His Royal Highness Prince and Pedro, and the expenses will naturally be supplemented by the Bianbu Town Hall. This is a commercial contract, not a family, you should move. The brain, not by imagining, yells here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...a nonsense!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, the income reduction is only your group of low-profile actors," she smiled. "I have performed at the Aberon Theatre in Wangdu, an open-air theater. It was a coincidence that there was a drizzle on the day, but the nobles were still full of seats. So you said that they are not willing to come to watch the show because of the civilians? No, they just don’t like to take a special trip to enjoy the performance of a group of monkeys. Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "..." The scene was caught in a strange silence, not only did no one stand up and blame her, not even the defenders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The last point, you said "Witch Diary" is inferior and vulgar, is the struggle and mourning of the dog who lost the family?" Mayi curled up his mouth, but the sound was cold to the extreme, " I may have forgotten to tell you that the script of this story was written by His Royal Highness Prince. Do you want to say that your Highness is inferior and vulgar? Insulting the royal family, but you have to punish the sentence, now you still intend to stick to your own point of view? "She looked at the crowd behind Bella. "Or some of you want to try?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her gaze, more than a dozen actors Go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough!" Bella bit his teeth. "Since you went to the town, you shouldn't come back again! You thought I didn't know, Mey! The reason why you go to that broken place is not to see Irene, but to dawn -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her voice came to an abrupt end, a bright red palm printed on her left cheek, Bella did not dare to touch her face, "You, you dare to fight, Hit..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call, it’s still impulsive, and Mey took a deep breath. In this way, you may encounter some trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, two male actors came out behind Bella, "Miss May, you have done a bit too much."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The importance of appearance to an actor, you will not know, I think you must at least apologize to her."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apologize? Doesn't that prove that I made a mistake? Mey sneered at the bottom of her heart, impulsive, but she didn't think she had a place to apologize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
