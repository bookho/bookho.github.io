Lightning dissatisfied, "She just took up I am old and cheap, and when I am an adult, I can certainly evolve a new and powerful ability!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That... can tell me Miss Mai What is the new ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Become a flying monster, although it looks fierce, flying up to cover the sky, but not at all cute "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜咕-" Mai Hao's high head is pulled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The flying behemoth... I want to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches are surrounded by two people, only the 76th heart is burning anxiously - these fools are all outsiders, simply can not ask Key points. Who cares if a high-ranking witch is cute or mighty? The key point should not be the relationship between the evolution of power and the magical cyclone, and how to become a high-level witch? For the first time, she felt that it was so difficult to maintain a smile, and there was an illusion that the corner of her mouth was about to twitch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the topic is getting more and more biased, she has to open her own mouth. "Miss McMillan now looks like a normal pigeon. How can I tell? Her abilities have evolved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be a slight chance that this may increase her chances of revealing her identity, but the 76th has not taken care of that much. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still has a trace of luck in her heart, maybe they clearly distinguish the difference between awakening day and adult solidification, but it is still possible to regard some branching ability as a high-level awakening - - After all, in some lucky people, there may be multiple branches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Resolve from the magic," answered Wendy, "If the magic of the ordinary witch is like a cyclone or mist, it will condense after evolution. In a new look, for example, the magic of McMug is a stretch of white wings, which is very different from the fog that was previously blurred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic condensed refactoring , the definition of the union is exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final suspicion is also broken, if the other party does not lie, then McMug is indeed a high-level witch. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there is no direct means of observing the magic on the seventy-sixth, but Wendy can be said to be so eloquent, obviously has a more comprehensive understanding of evolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that," she pressed her turbulent mood, revealing a look of ignorance. "Your ability... is that the same?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't condense the magic," Wendy replied calmly. "I still have a lot to learn from Anna."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So an "original witch" became the manager of the entire league, and also a group with high-level promoters? Seeing the intimate and easy-to-understand expression of the pigeon, the seventy-sixth suddenly gave birth to a feeling that it was too long to sleep, and the world was quite different from the familiar Tachella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf-hearted witch did not feel the complex emotions in her heart. In addition to Anne, the three men teased each other, and laughed and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of climbing along the mountain road, the 76th deliberately fell behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She puts the fingers of the colorful magic stone ring to the side of the eyelids, pretending to look like a blind eye, actually through the clear magic stone, blinking Lightning and wheat are looking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because both of them are in the ability stage, two eye-catching oranges suddenly appear in her vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light column at the top of the lightning is close to Anne and others, about one finger thicker, and the wheat stubble is thicker and stronger, almost equal to the arm, which is also in line with the high order. The key to the witch is a more complicated theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
