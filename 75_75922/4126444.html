			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the key figure of the Greysburg Weekly, the eyeliner of honey can be described as ubiquitous, which can be said to have both the advantages of Luojia and Maijiao. The olive grove in the backyard of the castle is like her base camp. It is not easy to avoid her exploration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that's the way it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she always knows the most interesting anecdotes in the city, she usually attracts many sisters, such as the witches around me now. It is the most concentrated cluster in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery and her detectives don’t say anything, nightingales, Wendy and books are not fools, even the leaves that haven’t appeared for a long time In the crowd, it seems to be talking to honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hide the secrets that you know, while keeping the secret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver looked at the hall At the other end, Anna glanced at the thoughts and had to go through the scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are these birds?" The sound of the leaves was quickly introduced into her ears. "I found new in the depths of the hidden forest." Varieties, they are not big, they fly very fast, and they are also very courageous. One will dare to sneak up with the gray eagle who steals the nest. I think you might use it, then bring a nest back."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the other side’s shoulders standing on two big and one small three kingfishers, and they were squatting on the cheeks of the leaves, not like what she described. Brave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, thank you," Honey held the bird happily. "I haven’t seen it for so long, I feel like you can be a bird trainer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably they used me as part of the forest." The leaves smiled. "That said, the changes in the city really surprised me... There are a lot more houses to say, and there are such novel things as magic shadows and newspapers. If it is not fun to explore the depths of the forest, I will envy you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should also come back to see more," Wendy said softly. "Everyone misses you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I miss you too..." The leaves hang down, "But the fascinating forest is now only the edge of the southeast side under the control of the heart of the jungle. I have to integrate with the forest for a long time to adapt to the growing consciousness. If you want to control the entire forest before the war, there is no other way than to seize all the rest of the time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp; "You have worked hard." The book touched her hair lovingly. "Let the lightning send the weekly new newspaper to you, you can always know what happened in the winter city." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a good idea," mystery said. "But the newspapers record everything that is well known. I want to know more secrets that only a few people can know." She looked at the honey. "If you have any discoveries, remember to inform the detectives. We have the most powerful explorers here, and we can guarantee you." Open all the puzzles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the word secret, Sylvie’s heart mentioned the apex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idiot, asking too direct! What can she do to get the topic open? No... I want to avoid the attention of the Nightingale and Wendy at the same time, and I don’t want to have a mysterious moon. It’s too high for her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, there are quite a few..." The honey slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Mystery moon eyes lit up and quickly asked, "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;大In the crisis, Sylvia wants to cry without tears, is it useful to have a dizzy or drunk? I don’t have such acting at all... Sorry, Anna, I have tried my best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, although I am very curious, but I can't say it." Honey spit out his tongue, "especially can't tell Roland down - this is Wendy’s request. She also said that no matter what vision is found, she must report to her first.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“诶?” Wendy glanced, "This is not fair!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvie was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the last crisis was lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is also successfully holding this secret... right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in this embarrassment, Sylvie spent her most difficult dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After the dinner, Roland returned to the bedroom with Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays it has been decorated as a wedding room for two people. Under the swaying candlelight, the figure of the girl’s phoenix crown is a lot more, but it is also a lot more. Different kind of feminine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward, gently removed the crown of her head and rolled her hair, opposite her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the clear eyes of the lake, he saw the affection of rippling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call my name, okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," she blinked. "My full name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna. Wimbledon ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna. Wimbledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you call me ten times?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland chuckles, "How many times." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to his call in the ear, Anna finally fell a little embarrassed. "I am... is it strange?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a bit," Roland scraped her nose. "The name will hear your ears groan in the future. And even if you don't have a surname, you are me." Wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his original world, marriage does not need to change the surname of a party, so he Not too much care about is called marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the case, but I feel that I am complete..." Anna held her chest. "It’s like no longer being alone." This is probably the meaning of the ritual... Whether it is wearing a crown or changing the title, it is achieved by attaching external changes to achieve a self-identity. Although the relationship between people does not require rituals to verify However, if this ring is missing, then I will feel sorry and regret when I think about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Roland couldn’t help but reach out. Lived her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All answers are superfluous at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of warmth, Anna began, "Roland, can I ask you a request?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he remembers correctly, this is the first time the other party has offered to ask for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to be your Minister of Industry. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was a little surprised. "This is no problem, but why are you suddenly..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Because I am just an ordinary girl from a remote town," Anna smiled. "Now it is suddenly the queen of the Grey Fort. There will be many people who are dissatisfied?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, no one dares to talk on this," Roland said comfortably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If everything is calmed down by you, it will only increase this suspicion," she shook her head. "I can't stay in you anymore." Behind me, I am only immersed in things I am interested in. I want to do more and let others have nothing to say from the front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
