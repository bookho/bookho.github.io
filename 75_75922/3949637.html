			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day is not yet bright, Kakusim’s door is knocked Got the pong. He yawned, and he subconsciously wanted to take the coat, and then he reached it in half, and the first thing to get up here was not to coat the jacket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick brick wall blocks the chill, and the incredible heating keeps the room warm, no matter how big the snow is outside, the house will not look like the past If there is a leak in the air, or the roof seeps through the water, such a good quality home, put in Jinsui City is basically something that the nobility can enjoy - of course, the area is small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door, the young man standing outside was his own deputy barracuda. ​​"How come you haven't gotten up, we have to hurry, Mr. Captain! Go to the night It’s not a good place!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Need to be so early?” Kakusim’s probe looked at the sky, and the morning sun just came out of the clouds. Come, the soft morning light illuminates the sky with a small horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course! I listened to the neighbor next door and said that this victory day celebration will also have a theatrical performance of the Star Flower Troupe. I am afraid that even the square will not enter." Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you wait for me," the old man shrugged, returned to his bedroom and changed clothes, looking at another empty bed. He sighed softly. Victory Day... I don’t know if there is such a celebration for the Long Song Fortress, or Vader will miss it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two went out and walked toward the square. The ropes on the trunks on both sides of the street were roped, and the colorful flags were hung under the ropes. Together with the reflection of the morning light, the atmosphere of the whole town has become completely new. From time to time, someone from the road to the main road, and side by side with them, it seems that they are planning to go to the square area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the news of the victory celebration, Kakusim was heard from the barracuda - His Royal Highness Prince will celebrate the land of the demon in order to celebrate the peace of the land. The first day after the end of the month was named Victory Day. On this day, the town not only took a full vacation, but also held a grand bonfire banquet in the central square. The deputy who heard the news excitedly ran to invite him to visit, and when he wanted to think that he was idle, he was still idle, and the old man agreed to his proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking to the square area, the central area has been separated by a wooden fence around the stage, and the police wearing black uniforms are maintaining order, many people It was earlier than them, and the open space was surrounded by three or four floors. The two quickly found a place near the stage and waited for the celebration to begin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun rises to the top of the head, the crowd is already gathering in the square, and the prince is also in the center of the stage. As soon as he appeared, Kakusim heard an overwhelming cheer, and the people around him excitedly raised their hands and shouted to their Highness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four princes smiled and waited for the people to calm down, raised their fists and screamed, "We once again defeated the evil!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the square suddenly exploded, and the deafening should make the old man's heart tremble. He has not seen such a lord who has been deeply embraced by the people for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My people, no matter where you are from, the West, or the North, or the East and the South, as long as you have contributed to this place This glory belongs to you! It belongs to everyone who pays sweat and blood for Bianbu Town!" The prince's calm and emotional voice is like magic, not shouting, but can be clearly passed to Kakusi. In the middle of the ear. "And today's Victory Day is the day for you - the evil has not been completely eliminated, it will come back sooner or later, but no matter how many times the enemy comes, as long as we are united and work together, victory will end us!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man has never heard of a royal aristocrat and civilians and called "we", but His Royal Highness does not seem to care, he looks to the people's eyes is So natural, there is no arrogance and disdain that is common to the nobility. It seems that in the eyes of the prince, all the people and he are a whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbelievable, but unexpected...coordination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, let us cheer, for a hard-won victory, toast to celebrate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live your Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
