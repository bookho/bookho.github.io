			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the enemy’s offensive has not stopped, but it has become increasingly fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, there are ten stone pillars whistling from the sky, the smoke and the red mist are flying together, almost obscuring the moonlight; the gravel is smashing It’s hard to do it on the ground, even if it’s the end of the legend, it’s just like this. One of them happened to be in the iron box stacking place. Danny had a direct shock from the huge impact without warning. When he reacted, he was lying on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...damn," he coughed twice, only to feel a pain in his chest, and his mouth was full of salty rust, "Malt, you "Is it okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't care," the eager voice of malt rang in his ear. "But you are hurt!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess the rib is broken?" Danny took a breath and sighed. "There is nothing important, as long as it doesn't prevent me from pulling the trigger, I can continue to fight." —”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fumbled back and forth until the familiar touch was introduced into the palm of his hand, and he was relieved – fortunately, his gun was not lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you have to escape from here, the sooner the better!" The voice of malt is almost pleading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny struggled to prop up his body and leaned against the iron box that had been twisted and deformed behind his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just such a small action that almost exhausts all his strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of his eyes, a black stone pillar standing like a high wall is bursting with red mist, and it will soon open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny slowly lifted the gun, the chest was no longer able to force, then put it on the shoulder and use the knee as a butt - less than ten meters away, He doesn't feel that he will miss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough, don't force it again! Why don't you go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one In an instant, he felt that it was like a scream of malt, and he was asking himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I don’t want to stay away from this smell of smoke, I don’t want you to disappear...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slate Falling down, the gunshots also sounded at the same time -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old friend in his hands did not live up to his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the enemy has not torn the bag of the package, the bullet has already penetrated the position of the target head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this time, the devil did not collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It walked out of the cylinder indifferently, smashing the broken capsule stuck to the body and revealing the whole picture in front of Danny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a devil much bigger than the madman, who is covered in weird armor and stretches when the other is completely straight. The shadow of him shrouded him, as if to cover the sky. In this darkness, only the eyes of the enemy are shining red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny put the second bullet into the barrel and pulled the trigger again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only heard a soft bang, the devil's chest smashed out the ignition light, and the light blue scorpion popped up like a swinging water surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil stares at him with cold eyes and walks toward him step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no light weapon, and there is no speeding up. This is undoubtedly a scorn that is beyond words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny mechanically repeated the movements in his hands - pulling the bolts and firing, and the other side let the bullets hit the body, nothing to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." Malt sobbed desperately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the loud deafening sound, the other side was shot and flew out and slammed into the iron box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the muzzle of a blue smoke, Danny couldn’t help but groan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a man stood in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Retreat, mortal," the man slightly turned his face. "You are not its opponent. Here we will take over."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He holds an amazing musket in his hand, and the bullets that are licking around his waist are almost the thickness of the wrist, which is obviously not affordable for the average person. And the comers are also wrapped in armor from head to toe, and look a bit like the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special Tactical Squad". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny’s heart flashed a thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the debut of the first expedition, this unit became the most mysterious unit in the first army, they never appeared in training, No one knows their exact number and location. The only thing that is certain is that they all come from the selection of their Majesty. It can be said that there is no such thing as the most elite combat force in Winter City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"吼"————————!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil from Climbing out of the iron box of the East, it made a breathtaking roar - compared to the previous contempt, it finally changed its attitude and took off the double-edged sword from the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, the high-level devil promoted by the Lord of Hell, it’s not hard to argue that the magic reaction will be so strong." The man rushed to the enemy without fear, "and we It’s for this moment!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several fighters dressed in the same costumes as he is behind – after this group of people joined the battle, the situation gradually occurred Change. Obviously carrying an astonishing weight, they can go farther than the speed of ordinary people, and push the enemy into the corner. And the play can be described as brutal and rude. After emptying the ammunition, instead of looking for a bunker, it is a puncture with a knives and a slash around the enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the devil also has agility that is inconsistent with the figure, it can be clipped by several madmen and four breads at the same time. The blue ripple on the other side has become more dim, obviously consumes quite a bit. Big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a warrior who is secretly trained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but here is his stage -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let yourself back? Unless he stops breathing completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny bit his teeth and use himself as a bracket for the gun, aiming the scope at the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a sneak attack on a special tactical squad from the rear was knocked down by a sniper rifle, the man looked back and stared at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denila opened the bolt and forced the smoke that had not been exhausted into the lungs - the stinging and intoxication mixed together, forming an indescribable the taste of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels great, isn't it? malt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hell! What the hell is the artillery camp?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you let these damn stone needles rain for a while!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They won't be a bunch The rookie who just entered the army has been thrown into the front line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the outer ring of the camp, the soldiers shrank under the seesaw and complained constantly, and the fish balls were among them. One. Although his position is a high-altitude machine gun group, it is not a fearful beast that comes from time to time in the night sky, but a more incredible thing - it is not a good idea to stand outside to control the machine gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being awakened by the attack, they immediately entered the line of defense in accordance with the emergency regulations. The road did not encounter the devil, but was quickly knocked down by crossfire and mortar. As it turned out, the line of defense did not suffer any shock, and the comrades-in-arms were still inexplicably questioning who they were shooting. Just as everyone thought that the next step was to clear up the scattered invaders, there were new instructions on the scene - no matter what the situation in the camp, they could not leave the trench and prepare to meet the real enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
