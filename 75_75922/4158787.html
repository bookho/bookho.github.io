Poshan leaned over and shouted, "Shul, fire ahead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Understand, aiming--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't aim, just hit it!" She pulled the bolt and swept it straight toward the monster. For a time, even the resonating magic stone was too late to re-tune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the car body turned backwards, the 75 short-barrel gun finally spewed out the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance of less than three hundred meters is almost instantaneous. When Shure fires, the flesh-and-blood monsters will make a round of smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be another airshot, but in the tumbling dust, the three captured the broken arm of the limb that fell from the sky - on the tank Even if the field cannon is small, it is also an artillery that cannot be compared with the machine gun. The flying dust also flashed the outline of the blade beast, and Poshan roughly counted it, at least ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This monster... carries a group of bladed beasts?" Bell also reacted at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am afraid it is the "nest mother" in the Tianhai world in the manual. Bossan sighed, but compared to the hand-drawn illustrations, the difference in the monster is a bit more, just like the mutated close relatives.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Returning to the corner of the street, the other two teams apparently noticed the noise they had made. Poshan had not yet opened, and Amy had already shouted. "Another tank squad is less than two streets away from us on the west side." , just five minutes to join them! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, don't go, it's too late! "Poshan replied with a scorpion, "Let the soldiers enter the fort!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the spot? There are more than one enemy! "The hero of the car of the 17th car group was surprised.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because there is more than one, we can't retreat! "Although the situation is extremely urgent, Poshan's mind is very clear--only three tanks are absolutely impossible to stop more than a dozen blade beasts. Once they are allowed to rush into the soldiers, it is absolutely irreparable loss." But they are different, as Isabella said, this kind of armored weapon is inherently both offensive and defensive, even if surrounded by enemies, it does not mean that the outcome has been divided.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hero, please seal the passage of the passage, only then, we can let go! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter looked back at the iron gate of the fortress's rust and deformation, and immediately understood her intentions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Amy, you will act with me later! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...good, good. "Although Poshan is not a squad conductor, Amy nodded subconsciously.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Team leader, you are really...cool! Shure admires.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When everyone goes back safely, they will be flattered again." "Poshan smacks her mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that this is not very good, but she can't restrain herself - she doesn't hate Xia, she can be busy with Xia The time of the pioneering land was really lacking. She couldn't deceive herself. When she was chased by the church, she thought that the stable life was the pursuit of the goal, but nowadays, she is more suitable for the battlefield filled with smoke.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may also be the reason why I am awakened as a fighting witch?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the soldiers enter the fort, the 17th team will be motivated Rising to the highest, the full speed reversed to the door -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a loud bang, the tank body was directly embedded in the wall and became a fixed bunker. Br />/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the invisible killer in the Tianhai world can no longer cross the steel line to attack relatively vulnerable soldiers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Blade Beast also crossed the hundreds of meters at this moment and appeared on the corner of the street - although Poshan could not see them directly, Sigil magic resonance line clearly indicates the location of the enemy <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;She screamed and then drilled into the turret, locking the exit top cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war machine is not the only artillery and machine gun to kill the enemy, as long as it maintains a certain speed, it is fat enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the whole force stepped on the valve, Bossan saw a magic line suddenly rising through the mirror of the car! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, this monster can still fly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she quickly reacted, it was the enemy’s long-range flying! She couldn't help but clench her handrails, and her body was stretched straight—the next thing is death and life, just look at the craftsmanship of the winter city craftsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哐!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy squats on the roof, the huge impact even makes There was a small depression in the top plate, and the resounding muffled sound made the three eardrums numb - but even so, the body only trembled fiercely, and there was no tendency to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bossan’s heart suddenly has a bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am responsible for aiming," she said as she swayed the turret. "You just have to pull the trigger."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about me?" asked Bei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The end point is the monster, as long as you don't hit the wall, how do you open it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Boshan did not pay attention to the enemies flying, she knows that the partner will solve the other party, if the flesh-and-blood monster is really a nest mother, it must be eliminated first, otherwise the blade beast on the plain will only be more and more . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the roar of the Rubik's power, the tank braved the white smoke into the bladed beasts - the coaxial machine gun madly sprayed the bullets, and the blade beasts Without the barrier capability of a high-order demon, each warhead can cause real damage. If it hits the key, it will instantly throw the target to the ground. Even if it is not dead, it is a steel track waiting for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade beast can only pierce the steel plate of the tank when the fore paw blooms blue, but this will also expose them to the machine gun's shooting range - nine Most of the bullets in the car group fell to the front of the car, and Amy apparently took the lead Poshan as a calibration target without worrying about accidental injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the two tanks smashed a bloody path from the enemy. After the four ruts, there was a pile of fleshy bodies lying flat. When the vital function ceases, the confusing stealth ability is no longer effective, and the shortcomings of the bladed beast defense are exposed at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bossan’s tanks are equally scarred, and the machine guns at the top of the turret have disappeared. The tall bodies are opened with several gaps, black blood and even splashes. Into the car. The enemy's nearest stabbing was only a few centimeters away from her, and she could almost feel the magical power of the claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the biggest difference between the machine and the living body is here, even if it is covered with scars, the performance of the tank is not declining. It maintains a full speed rush to the square, and the enemy's crushed organ becomes a lubricant between the teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably aware that the situation is not good, the nest mother began to turn back and flee, but the huge body can be described as clumsy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- This is not a whirlpool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the most critical element of shooting?" asked Poshan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's close enough." Shure replied seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you can't shoot it this time!" Bayo called the control tank straight toward the target, and the front bezel suddenly inserted into the enemy. Among the ribs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster suddenly made a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the gunner's position, now the entire field of vision is in front of the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shure does not hesitate to press the button. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
