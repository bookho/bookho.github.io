			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book stood behind Roland’s Highness and quietly watched his writing. The autumn sun shines behind the window, making her feel like she is bathed in a warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, in addition to the electronic gains and losses, what else is there... Online, etc., very urgent." The prince sometimes wrote two pens on paper, then I began to hold my forehead and meditated, and I also said some incomprehensible nonsense. At first, the book was still worried about the physical condition of the other party. Later, it was discovered that this was just the normal state of His Royal Highness when he recalled "knowledge." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that today’s symptoms are more serious than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he can't help him... The book sighs softly, and the witch can help him in this respect, I am afraid that only Anna. All of the previous pages written by His Royal Highness have been recorded in her mind - but they are only memorized. This knowledge is much deeper than the mathematical and natural principles of the past. Just reading it once again can make people feel dizzy. It is no wonder that His Highness will be so embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or, come here today?" The book couldn't help but open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland gave up the pen and gave a sigh of relief on the back of the chair. "I really envy you for the ability to remember, if I can be like you." In this way, why bother to fear the exam. I have already been admitted to a famous school and embarked on the peak of my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She automatically ignored the other half of the nonsense, "His Royal Highness in the Royal Palace Do you need an exam?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, otherwise how to distinguish which prince is better," he muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, sometimes it is not something to remember," the book smiled. "For example, bad encounters, sad and sad things, or forget more. Happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Haifeng County, due to his poor status, there have been countless bullying and beatings. Until now, she still clearly remembers the parts that were hit, the perpetrators vented their angry, distorted faces, and the pain caused by each punch and foot. Her days were a little better until she was sheltered by the old captain of the broken leg. In fact, people like slums, who die every day because of internal looting and fighting, are no less than starving to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, she has been so disgusted with herself, why all the sufferings are vivid. Because the scenes in memory are too clear, almost unbearable pasts are repeated in the middle of the night. Later, on the day of her adulthood, she awakened her branch ability "Magic Book" and realized that the memory of the far surpassing ordinary people was brought by the identity of the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably Roland also guessed what he was thinking, showing a sorry smile. "You are right."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book suddenly felt a warmth in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Few people care about the witch's thoughts, not to mention the other is a prominent royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, those are gone, Your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland.Wampton The nobles she has seen... No, it should be very different from the people she has ever seen. He has knowledge of erudition, but he always thinks about imparting it to others; he is noble, but he has no attitude of rejecting others; he enjoys the pursuit of everyone, and he can do everything he can, but he not only does not do this, but instead Take care of each other's mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lonely and impoverished town has undergone earth-shaking changes in a year, and the witches have also received long-awaited peace and freedom. The gift of His Royal Highness. If it was not for personal experience, she would not believe that there would be such a ruler in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book now finds that its own thoughts are also changing a little. Before, she did not agree with her Highness to marry the witch, but at the moment she felt that no matter who she was, Going to the throne of the Grey Fortress - he relies not on the aristocrats who cling to the rules, the greed for profit, but the people who support him to bring a better life for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She vaguely feels that this power will be stronger than any previous force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, forget it," Roland suddenly stunned his head. "This is the last page."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
