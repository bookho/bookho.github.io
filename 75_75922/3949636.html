			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a heavy machine gun. The bullets used are exactly the same as the bolts. Just pull the bullet out of the tape and launch it with a new rifle. His Royal Highness took a picture of this thick firearm. "As for its mechanical principle, it is much more complicated than a rifle. If you don't understand it, you won't go into it here. I named it a Mark 1 heavy machine gun." Then I will personally demonstrate it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he sits behind the firearm and presses the trigger at the end, the iron axe can hardly believe his eyes. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a continuous stream of fire at the muzzle, and the air from the spurt shook the fluffy snow, and the bullets were like being pulled by something. On the other end, the hot shells popped up one by one, and dozens of them fell on the ground in the blink of an eye! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one firearm in front of the shooting, but the sound is even more amazing than a group of firearms. The gunshots are connected in a series. No gaps. The prince did not aim at the distant target, but aimed at the snow not far from the front. The dense bullets brought up a snow column. The whole ground seemed to be boiling. One snow column did not land, the other The snow column has already soared, as if the bullets were intertwined into a network of death in that area, and anyone trying to pass through would be crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... is amazing too," the chief knight muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than Carter, the iron axe used the light to sweep through several other people, except for the nightingales who have been guarding Roland, there is not much change in the face, the rest of the witches are It is a dull appearance. And the black-haired woman with a huge sword is ashamed, her looks are more complicated, shocked, confused, and lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe could not help but have a feeling of empathy, he can become the chief of the Aosha clan, relying on the archery and knife method from a small hard training. Those brave martial artists who have outstanding talents and are unbeaten in the clan battles are the objects that the patriarchs are vying for. Even if the reaction is sharp, the skill is more flexible, and you can't avoid bullets that you can't see at all. Even the shortcomings of the firearms need to be changed. They don't exist in front of Mark. It can be imagined if the first army can be equipped. Ten to twenty heavy machine guns, the enemy's hard-working skills for more than ten years will become jokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is certainly not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......Fortunately he has found a new path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The leaves move quickly through the branches, driving the evil beasts that have entered the hidden forest to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area she can control now is close to the size of the town. These plants are equivalent to her eyes and limbs, not only can grow according to her will, but also build Fight against outsiders' defenses. Only the Highness has repeatedly stressed that it is not necessary for her to come forward to cope with the enemy, encounter a powerful evil beast or devil, and inform the town's garrison. In particular, the latter - in the event of a discovery, causing the devil to destroy the entire forest, the loss will be even greater, and she will have to rely on her to provide early warning, and the forestry materials that can be adjusted according to demand are also a great asset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, the leaves opened up a vacant lot near the town, and planned to start planting a new batch of "Gold No. 1" wheat after the end of the evil month. This time, with the heart of the forest to provide her with a source of magic, the wheat ear used for seeding grows almost in an endless stream of energy, even if it is not a problem for the farmer who supplies the whole west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, she felt a group of wolf-shaped hybrids entering the edge of the jungle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves immediately turned their attention to the invaders, only to see that eight singular beasts were fleeing deep into the forest, just as she intended to use the flight messenger notice When the First Army rushed them back to the city wall, they suddenly noticed something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They completely lost the wickedness of the past, just like what was driven by the general rush to escape, the branches and vines that extended one after another could not stop them from flying. pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it... the devil is coming again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves frowned, and as she prepared to expand the scope of the sweep, there was a glimmer of warmth above her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
