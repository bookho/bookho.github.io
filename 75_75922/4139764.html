			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the winter warding plan, Aegis, Axe and Itis took the train to the forefront. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to meet the dual needs of firepower and material transportation, the two-wire railroad has become four ramps here, and its configuration and site area are exactly the same. Although the increase in engineering volume has led to a much slower progress, the commanders understand that Tower 10, the terminal of the Torch Program, is likely to not appear in the decisive battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wait until the fortress-like station is built, the devil can't change the game no matter what, so the other commander should be very clear - cast from steel The Heihe River is extremely difficult to destroy. Even if it is interrupted for two or three days, humans can repair the line through the site, which makes the used tactics that have been used in the past lose their function. And the site with the fire line impact defense is undoubtedly sent to death. The only chance for the devil was to stop the advance of the First Army before the No. 10 station was put down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, there is no clear time node for a decisive battle - it can break out at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the bunkers, hustle and dark castles on both sides of the railway have everything, and they are arranged according to the battle site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Ai Gesha noticed that the track that was originally facing the holy city was deflected by a slight angle, so that the train side tends to be parallel with the Takira. In the words of Your Majesty, this is the most suitable line of battle line for the power of car guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two columns of Heihe armored trains standing at the end of the track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They acted as the mobile bastion, and the four sets of rotatable machine gun towers were ready to fire at the devil trying to approach the position, with the 152 mm fortress gun mounted The mobile version is directed at the sky, always aiming at the direction of the city of Taqiela. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step into the center of the camp, the ruins of the ruins covered by lush vegetation are gradually appearing in the eyes of the ice witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she knew this ending long ago, she still felt an indescribable impact and grief when she saw that there was only one home with a broken wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after more than four hundred years, she can still find the shadow of the old city from the broken outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you born from that place?" asked Itis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha nodded, and the memories of her once again surged into her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, starting today, you are a member of the federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s the youngest high-level awakened person in history, and the Quest will welcome you to join.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister, you are so amazing!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what you are doing! They are all soldiers who sacrificed everything for the federation Now, just coma, but you have to turn them into test materials?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How low is the recovery of the head from being hit hard? You are not I don't know, they must hope to make a greater contribution in the experiment than they are dying like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't accept it." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is an order signed by Master Akalis. If you can’t accept it, then you can quit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, the wall has been broken, the coalition may not last long! Let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But my My sister hasn't come back yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a defending soldier, can't leave the line of defense without authorization. If you die here, don't you let her down? !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's take this opportunity, you are running away!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But... adults, leaving Takira, where can we go?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not give up, we still have hope! Over the mountains, across the river, to the wild land... to recast the order!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you want to stay until the end? If you escape now, you might still be able to survive."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have the magic, but I understand a lot of things - it is my duty to guard you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here, she woke up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture flashed a bit, like A reincarnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of most federation witches, she is a different kind, even though she is in the name of genius, she is controversial because of her attitude towards mortals, and later It was because of the squad of the Prisoner’s Plan that the squad was crowded out, and it was only necessary to continue his research in the private test tower in the fascinating forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, Aegusa still has an indelible feeling for Takira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city was once regarded as the last bastion of mankind, and there have been countless heroic deeds. Thousands of witches and hundreds of thousands of ordinary people have followed suit. The devil's battlefield. Her sister is also one of them, and still does not know which part of the collapsed wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape from birth did not bring the feeling of relief, but became a heavy responsibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as you close your eyes, there will be countless war-stricken compatriots crying in your ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not a fugitive - every time she has a nightmare, Ai Gesha repeatedly tells herself that she is alive to be able to revenge and to recapture this piece one day. Human land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believes that those who cherish the witch are also holding on to this belief and have been persisting to this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lives are not just for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ruins on the horizon, two towering giant skeletons are faintly visible. It is the new war weapon of the devil and represents the source of the nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the iron axe, "I have a request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say." Mo Jinren nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the first army can successfully advance the battle line within ten kilometers, the first round of shots to the city of Taqila, I hope to be by me and God. Penalize the witches to come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only thunder and flames can end this nightmare - the roar of artillery will inevitably razor the ruins of the Holy City, The remaining urban remains will be transformed into fly ash along with the bones of the compatriots who died in battle, becoming part of the fertile plains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Takira will be ushered in a new life in destruction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later, when the engineering team worked overtime to lay the rails to the distance tower When he pulled the position about 12 kilometers, Sylvie took the lead in noticing the change of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of madmen climbed out of the red-fog-corroded land under the giant skeleton, and poured into the ditch. Then the two large "black shadows" appeared in front of the broken wall and slowly moved in the direction of the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately realized that it was two amazing stones of sacredness - just like the sacred stone pillars that were found in the Battle of the North Slope Mountains. Its size may be comparable to some small primary ore bodies in the mine. The coverage of the black shadow is close to one hundred and fifty meters. More importantly, it completely obscures the line of sight of the magic eye, so that the rear scene is completely hidden in the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
