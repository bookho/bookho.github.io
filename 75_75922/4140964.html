			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly cried intermittently for an hour to calm down, and when Roland put her on the couch, she found that she had fallen asleep. When the two separated, the tears and snots that were lumpy together pulled out a few filaments between the cheeks and the clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of such "no majesty" is naturally inconvenient for the witch who sleeps to curse to see, Roland thought about it, and finally called Anna, with her. Tigri took the big bedroom on the third floor of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After wiping her cheeks, Tilly’s breathing returned to a smooth, but there was still no sign of waking up, which made her really tired. It is not uncommon to rely on busy work to paralyze myself. This kind of shock treatment is not uncommon. I am afraid that after learning the news of the ashes, she will not have a good rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will sleep with her tonight," Roland sighed. "This time I am most afraid of being alone. Now I can look after her. There is only you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, I can feel the mood of her, know what to do." Anna nodded gently. Then what about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I went to the third side of the city to sleep well, anyway, these days are there, and it will be fine for a while. Roland replied, "And the news of the victory of the torch action should also let them know earlier - I think the ancient witches have been waiting for this day for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Well." Anna came over and kissed his cheek. "Although I don't want you to leave, these things are really more important..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry It’s rare that you come back from the front line.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t say stupid things, my Majesty, I’m still growing.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland To the door, Anna and stopped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, don't forget to call the nightingale," she said earnestly. "The only thing in the city that can't be accidental is you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the other person’s clear eyes, Roland should cover the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a large team of guards, just entered the third side of the city, Pasha It appeared in front of him for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, is there any new news on the front line? How is the situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the other side The swaying whiskers can be known, her nervousness and turmoil at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not intend to sell off the customs, and went straight to the road. "We have achieved complete victory - the devil on the plain was cleared, and the demon was not able to Escaped back, and now Takira has been placed under the control of the First Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa's tentacles momentarily rested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds of silence, she said excitedly, "Is this true? Your Majesty, please forgive my rude... I don't doubt you, just I really don't know what to say - can you tell me more details?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After more than four hundred years of tempering, there are very few things that can These high-level witches have such a big change in their emotions. This is the first time Roland has seen Pasha’s gaffe, "Of course. But-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I am going to inform you of this good news!" But before he finished, Pasha disappeared at the top of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stunned for a moment, and finally he shook his head helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he enters the underground hall, not only Pasha, Elsie, and Celine, all the remaining goddess of witches have gathered in the center of the hall. Lined up in a straight horizontal team, looking forward to waiting for him to open his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made it difficult for Roland to complete the latter half of the sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go with the flow," the nightingale whispered, "or later telling Pasha alone with a conscious exchange."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the survivors who have been looking forward to more than four centuries, victory is the most important thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished the only news, the crowd was already boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheers are endless, not the girl and the tears of tears, but whether it is crying or laughing, everyone expresses the same feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A joy that breaks away from bondage after hundreds of years of silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please forgive me for being rude and offensive to you," Elsie took the initiative to come to him and plunged the Lord. "From today, The united front has no need to exist anymore. You are the only ruler of Takira and our will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passa and Catherine did not interject, Obviously it is her default. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also tantamount to recognizing that Tachilla will exist as an inseparable part of the Grey Fortress Kingdom in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded and said that after accepting, Elsie re-established the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is one more thing I have to tell you," he concentrated on, and informed Alone of the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What? It turned out to be her." Pasha said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly out of Roland’s surprise, they did not show much emotional volatility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... already know?" he couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we are just getting ready." Ayr said calmly, "The ambush squad is surrounded by the devil's premeditated, if it is the federation era, basic There is no possibility of surviving. It is a blessing to be able to save everyone at such a price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may not understand, but death is coming to us." It’s a common occurrence,” said Catherine. “After all, everyone is voluntarily surviving through the fusion of soul instruments and carriers. This process is equivalent to having been screened by death, not to mention the battle of the gods. The face of the casualties was defeated. The only thing we fear is the meaningless death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Elena just does There is a choice that every Tajima warrior will make," Elkh finally said. "So, you don't have to care about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So ... Is this being comforted? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was quite emotional and didn’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course this does not mean that we will not be saddened by the death of our companions, but the war has taught us to exercise restraint." Pasha looked to the still-rejoicing Witches, "I will tell them about this thing - but at this moment, let them enjoy the joy of victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the return of the frontline troops, the news of the Northern Expedition’s victory has gradually spread in the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it does not seem to be as shocking as defeating the evil beast or the Duke of Ryan, it does not cause the whole city to celebrate, but the people still return from joining the army. A little bit of the family's neighbours pieced together the true face of the enemy - fierce, powerful, and fearless, far from being a hybrid and a Duke of the Knights. In addition to the testimony of the witnesses of the terrorist attack, a strong enemy image that completely coincides with the hell devil is gradually erected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, it's exaggerated into the legendary catastrophe, and the descriptions of height, mouth and flame are common and quickly become the street. One of the hottest topics in the alley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even such an enemy is still defeated by the First Army, and it is still a thousand miles away. This kind of rhetoric greatly invigorates the hearts of the people. - If even the devil from hell can't compete with the Grey Fort Army, who else is their opponent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
