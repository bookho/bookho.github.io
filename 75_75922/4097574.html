			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant stone gun did not launch a second round of artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to facilitate the observation of the enemy and the point of the bomb, the Duke built six high platforms in the city for the placement of artillery and trebuchet. In other words, they are higher than the wall, and any action by the other party can't escape the eyes of the attacker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a foolproof choice. The condescending perspective not only brings better efficiency, but also increases the range of shells and ripraps. With a strong sense of oppression. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in front of the Roland Army’s incredible artillery, the high platform became a striking target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willien felt for the first time that a quarter of an hour was so long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosion on the wall seems to have not stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the home soldiers tried to fill the snow powder, a shell hit the right side of the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the table seems to have a bright sun, together with a huge stone cannon and more than 20 people engulfed, then the bright red flames Countless tentacles rushed in all directions, and the buildings in the city also raised a yellow dust due to the violent tremors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A broken bronze tube flew out of the flame, crashed into the side of another high platform and fell straight into the ground, falling into a group of people carrying the stone. The body of the flesh shows its fragility and weakness at this moment - when the barrel tumbling for two laps, the ground has already had a pool of red and brown meat. Those unlucky ones whose hands and feet are crushed and still not suffocating are holding their own broken limbs and screaming, hope that someone can give them a happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Willie has not taken care of them at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanglou is also a conspicuous goal for the enemy. As soon as the wall turns into a sea of ​​fire, the nobles lose the courage to continue watching. Time to retreat. This decision is obviously correct. The speed of the shelling of the other side far exceeds the imagination of everyone. There will be a round of shells landing at almost every tenth, and the accuracy of hitting is getting higher and higher. The surrounding area has become an extremely dangerous area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a fireball that rose outside the city, and then all squatted in the city, and moved closer to the high platform and the city gate. In the city, the smoke and the crumbs fluttered, and the roaring and mourning were mixed together, just like the scene in hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the enemy finally stopped shooting, the six high-rises were destroyed, and the gate was opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan, the Duke’s family soldiers should immediately put down the iron fence or broken dragon stone to block the passage into the city, and at the same time prepare for the blocking, but experienced such horror After the bombardment, it has become an unrealistic request to continue to hold on to the post. The flames flowed along the grease, and the burnt bodies were seen everywhere on the wall. Even if someone escaped, they lost the courage to fight, not to mention the conquered people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ones that can run are all running out, and the rest is not being scared of the soul, it is a serious injury, unable to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he thought he would fail, he didn’t expect it to be so fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has not been hurting one opponent, the line of defense has collapsed across the board. In the past two years... What did Roland do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, this...can't fight..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We still surrender ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, surrendering does not mean giving up, we can find other opportunities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's right, as long as they stay in the East, this hatred will be reported sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Feifeike is here, he must not Will blame you, you have tried your best, just blame the enemy is too ferocious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willien silent for a moment, turned to look at Gulina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
