			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tucker Tolden boarded the thick wall of the New Holy City and slowly walked over to the mottled wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the most peaceful month of the demon after the establishment of the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to resist the attack of the evil beast, no matter how big the snow is in the past, some people will clean and de-ice, so the city wall always maintains its unique blue-gray In the background of white, it is particularly eye-catching. But now, he left a series of footprints in the flat snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no slab on the stone pavement, and there is no stain on the plaque in the gap. All the traces of the battle are buried by the snow, as if nothing happened. It used to be an incredible sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that there have been so many recent changes, so that this incredible is not so interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that the holy city of Hermes would be stepped on the ground before the wave of evil beasts, and all the believers were ready to die with the cathedral. The preparations, but did not expect that there are very few enemies in the snowfield, even the meaning of climbing the wall does not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone has not had time to celebrate, the gods have shown its impermanence in a very cruel way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the scavenging of the Grey Fortress consumes too much power in the church, so their primary task after the winter is to re-elect the three bishops and the corresponding senior staff . In order to stabilize the order of the Holy City and at the same time to restore the believers' faith in the gods, many young believers have become the backbone. He also became one of the temporary bishops because of the identity of the original presiding judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, just as the situation improved slightly, the cathedral suddenly collapsed on a windless night, and even a group of high-rises fell into the deep pits of the earth, and instantly The feeling of the rest of the life of everyone was crushed. And he happened to have escaped the disaster because of the patrol camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knows how it happened, even though it has been heard that there has been a fire in the core area of ​​the church underground, and it has been invaded by evil spirits, but there is no pope. The permission, they can not arbitrarily enter the sect of the secret organs, even if the whereabouts of the agent Pope Teflon is unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the collapse of the Cathedral of Hermes is even more serious than the defeat of the army. The failure of the army can be the reason for the command. The blame for the enemy is too cunning, but the Tongtian Tower, which represents the unyielding will, is a symbol of the spirit of the church. Its overthrow is equivalent to the god has abandoned the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was such a change in the situation where the human heart was floating and the situation was in jeopardy. It almost became the last straw to overwhelm the horse, even if he blocked the scene for the first time. To no avail. The inhabitants of the Holy City began to flee Hermes. First, a small number of merchants and peripheral businessmen whose beliefs were not so firm, followed by the outer city and the inner city... The fear spread like a plague, but there was no God-given antidote to contain it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has organized all the judges and priests, and held a pious prayer on the wall, hoping that the gods will once again look at the last bastion of this human being. Don't let thousands of creatures behind you be swallowed up by evil Hell forces, but never get any response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tucker Thor remembers the teachings of Pope Mein - the only strength that can be relied upon to fight against evil, except to pray to God. He has not thought of other ways to stop the broken beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop adult...I was here," a woman’s voice suddenly sounded behind her. "The troops chasing the fugitives are back, but..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There have been a few scattered, right?" He turned back and said softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporter is the surviving judge of the trial, replacing Farina, who is on her own mission. In her face, Tucker saw a few familiar shadows. After thinking about it, he remembered the advance camp warrior who dedicated himself to the church. Eleania - as a rare female trial warrior, they all have the same A strong character, one can still persist in fighting when the teammates die and hurt, and the evil beast approaches the wall of the cathedral; one takes over the burden of commanding the trial army when the church is crumbling, and tries to maintain the collapse of the bureau. Control the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Farina groaned angrily. "The group of recruits who are temporarily joined do not come in handy. There are more than 20 people when they go out." There are only one or two who come back - even if they are too negligent in training, they can't be killed by the fugitives. If you find me, they must be good-looking these traitors!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The five hundred and sixty-four people, now guarding the inner wall of the holy city, should be able to stop the escape of the inner city residents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus is not being pressed The centuries of the ruins of the church, the remnant of the army, this is also the last elite of the church... He knows clearly that it is impossible for this person to block the devil's attack. The destruction of mankind is a foregone conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this extremely powerful enemy, he had learned from Meien’s mouth. All the efforts made by the church are to preserve humanity when the war of the last days comes, so that the continuation of the fire will not be extinguished, so there will be such a powerful warrior as the Prisoner. But this is not enough. Before the advent of this war, the church must unite the four kingdoms and integrate the power of all mankind to hope to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since today’s hopes no longer exist, what is the significance of everyone’s insistence on this plateau fortress? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really nothing left to do with him, but for these more than 500 people, it may be a relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to the east," Tucker said. "Whether it’s going to the winter or the wolf, as close as possible to the coast, we can build a new holy place there. City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, even if the devil breaks into the four kingdoms, you can take a boat from the port and escape to a farther place - if you are lucky, you can Before the destruction, I will spend this life safely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leaving Hermes?" Farina stunned. "But adults...when we left, who will resist the evil beast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the evil beast enters the hinterland of the mainland from the big gap, it is also the crime committed by the gray castle. The imperative task of the church is to preserve the power. If the cathedral is gone, it can be rebuilt. However, believers cannot withstand the loss, and when the evil beasts are flooded in the four kingdoms, people will remember our strength again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't matter at all, they are not real enemies, the deadly threat comes from the depths of hell, and you can't do anything about it. The last thing I can do is to keep you away from the battlefield as much as possible - in order to protect humanity, you have done enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina wrinkled her embroidered eyebrows. "The ones who are determined to stay here are the devout who are willing to live together with the Holy City. They may not promise to give up." "Mermes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The place where you are is the holy city, children. They will promise, as long as you persuade." Tucker paused, " And this is also the order of the Acting Pope - save yourself, continue the church, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much can you go, the fugitive will soon send these messages Spread out, by then, the king of the Grey Fort is probably going to be mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, adults...no, squat." Farina bit her lip and finally clenched her fists in her chest and bent over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the gray sky suddenly had a touch of dimness, and he turned and saw a gap in the clouds, orange sunset Slowly revealing the figure, throwing the road to the white snowfield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... the end of the evil month?" Farina revealed a hint of joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it will take a long time for the snow to melt, so let me know. If you start to prepare, you can start in two or three weeks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, then I will retire first!" She nodded and ran towards the inner city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the prayer bells that announce the dusk are also coming from the holy city. The nine bells have both the meaning of timekeeping and the prayers of the believers to close their eyes to the gods. time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Tucker did not pray. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the gods have not heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off his crown and placed it on the wall, then climbed the wall and looked into the distant sunset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to let these people completely abandon Hermes, he still has one thing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
