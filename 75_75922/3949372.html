			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four days later, the caravans of the caravans sailed off the pier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa and the 100 First Army soldiers along the ship, departed to the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these days, Roland and Margaret reached an agreement that Tassa could withdraw any amount of Golden Dragon at her store, which will be sold at the steam engine. In addition, in addition to this, Roland also needs to pay an additional interest of 1%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the other party’s saltpeter and ingots were almost twice as high as the last time, but with the addition of two riverboats, Roland still won two More than two hundred and two gold dragons were recorded, which is almost a figure that can't be imagined in the moon of the demon. Even if it sells a month of ore, it is only three hundred gold dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the caravan left, Mai Hao also went to the day of leaving the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the agreement with the ashes, she will travel to the fjord islands to bring news about the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland specifically wrote a long letter to her, in addition to expressing the attitude of mutual assistance and cooperation, I also hope that the five kings can send some auxiliary witches to help themselves. In the letter, he did not live as a brother, but negotiated the matter with the lord of Bianbu Town and the status of the West. Although the possibility of the other party's promise to himself is small, he still has to give it a try - anyway, writing a few words will not take much effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place to be sent is in the backyard of the castle, and all the witches are here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night gave her a small bag of dried fish; lightning sent a packet of pepper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other witches looked forward to stroking her feathers and hugged her farewell - the battle was just like the farewell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure!" She raised her head. "I will be back soon, hehe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "What if I don't want you to come back," Lightning said worriedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕..." The pigeons narrowed their necks and thought for a while, shaking their tail feathers. "Then I sneak back and smash!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we said it," the little girl seriously promised. "If you come back, I will personally grab a bunch of birds to bake for you. And the last time we discovered The hive, keep waiting for you to come and smash it together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" She nodded again and again, "Say it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you say that? Roland was filled with emotions on the side. It was only a month that he had completely turned the wheat to his side. Well done, lightning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, everyone see you again!" Mai Hao started his strong wings and ran for a while on the ground before slowly flying up. After two rounds, it gradually disappeared. In the southeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She can arrive smoothly." Roland looked at the slow movement and couldn't help but squeeze her sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem," Lightning did not hesitate, then squatted. "Should...?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandoned the wheat, Roland soon plunged into the busy daily work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, he will draw a complete set of designs for the two boats to be rebuilt by the Crescent Moon Caravan - and they will also become The world's first steam-powered paddle steamers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a single power source, the steam engine power shaft can be directly connected to the paddle wheel without the need for a gearbox. The air intake is controlled by a plurality of intake ducts to control the speed of the ship. To slow down or stop the boat, simply turn off the intake manifold and allow excess steam to escape from the exhaust. At this time, the fire still keeps burning, and it is convenient to speed up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle is not difficult, Roland quickly drew a rough model. In order to get accurate production drawings, you have to go to the site to measure the specific size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?" He put down the quill, and couldn't help but smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This book is finished," she put the book on the desk, which is the "The Foundation of Natural Science Theory." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s smile suddenly stuck on his face, which is too exaggerated. Only a few months have finished reading the high school math and physics knowledge? He didn't ask the other person if he understood it, because Anna's reading means full understanding, otherwise she will definitely look over it again, or ask herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The drawings you drew, do you want to use a steam engine instead of a sail to power the boat?" Anna’s attention was quickly drawn to the sketches on the table. "But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two wheels are similar to Paddle? Thrust can be generated when turning, but half of it is exposed, which is equivalent to wasting some power. Why not bury it all in the water?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "..." Roland groaned, not knowing what to say. The person who knows it can't exist. That is to say, she made the above judgment based on the impression of this moment alone? He suddenly raised his interest. "What do you say is better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna thought for a moment, raised the pen and started drawing on paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland supported the chin and enjoyed her interest in the serious drawing - the bangs that slipped from the hairpin swayed with her movements, Slender eyelashes beat from time to time, and the white cheeks reveal a natural rosy. Although this angle can only see the side face, the silhouette from the bridge of the nose to the chin and then the neck to the neck forms a perfect and soft curve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to eat fish fillets?" The nightingale came over and put his hand between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Anna nodded, covering the snacks that the latter handed over, "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Roland, who was obstructed by the line of sight, coughed twice and had to look back at the pictures on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Anna tried to completely bury the paddles in the water, but this would make it difficult to observe the position of the wheel when the boat was docked. It is easy to make it hit the dock or the trestle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she placed the paddle wheel to the stern - this is also a common practice, but the drive setup is much more complicated, after all, the bulky steam engine is not suitable for At the end of the hull, the drive shaft and gearbox will occupy a significant portion of the hull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland saw the new drawings she had drawn, she couldn’t help but marvel at her sharp thinking ability again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sketch that Anna is pondering is infinitely close to the arrangement of a single-axis propeller. The steam engine is placed at the bottom of the hull, and the drive shaft extends out of the hull below the waterline. Connected to four square blades, it looks a bit like a windmill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if I can do this," she hesitated. "It is reasonable to say that as long as the paddle is kept at an angle of inclination, a horizontal component can be generated, but I have reduced a paddle wheel and it is impossible to push the hull by four paddles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, just a little modification." Roland I used Anna's quill to draw the original appearance of the propeller. "This shape of the blade is more suitable for rotation in the water than the windmill. Your idea is completely correct, but the contractual requirement is to transform into a paddle steamer, so we Still doing it in the first way - it's not about technology, it's a business strategy." He paused. "I'm going to actually test the hull data. Are you coming with me?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny licked the blue eyes, "Well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After mastering the theory, in practice Verifying is the best way to learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Anna followed the prince to the door, seeing the nightingale still looking at the drawings on the table, could not help but open the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
