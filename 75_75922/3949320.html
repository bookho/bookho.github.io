			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle and structure of the DC generator are very simple. Roland has dismantled more than a dozen four-wheel drive motors from a normal whiteboard motor to the legendary gold. Supermaster, but also wound the rotor copper wire by yourself. These motors are typical DC motors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DC generator and the DC motor have no difference in structure. Essentially, they are the same thing and the functions are interchangeable. As long as other machines drive the rotor of the motor to rotate and let the wire continuously cut the magnetic line, the energy source continuously generates an induced current. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of Mystery and Anna, Roland only spent half a day assembling a simple DC motor. The stator parts were all made of wood and then handed over. The mystery moon gives magnetism. The commutator segments at the end of the rotor are embedded in a truncated log with holes in the center of the log that can be connected to the steam engine shaft. This configuration is convenient for production and ensures that the commutator segments are insulated from each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the new steam engine, it became the processing skill of him and the mysterious moon to watch Anna’s performance. When it is necessary to make a large part, she will open the black fire, wrap a pile of iron ingot like a cloth, fuse it and then shrink it, press it into a sheet that meets the size requirements, and finally cut it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the next day, when Roland was preparing to go to the backyard of the calcining room to test the effect of the generator, the guards brought a good news that made him very happy, from Chishuicheng Alchemy. The chief alchemist of the workshop has arrived in Bianbu Town, and more than one person has come along. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Cayme Stoel walked very decisively, and that afternoon he took his family and more than a dozen disciples to the merchant ship to Bianbu Town. Regrettably, Chamez hesitated and refused his invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not disclose the contents of this letter to other alchemists, the more people he knew, the later the departure time. Kemo worried that the news of the success of crystal glass firing will soon be passed to the duke's ears, and it will not be so easy to think about it again. For this high-margin luxury product, the Duke must definitely hold it in his hands. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has written the glass formula and firing method on the parchment and stored it in the formula cabinet of the refining room. It is also considered to be a large amount of money for the Duke to build the alchemist. The return of the workshop. It is only in the face of the truth of alchemy, whether it is crystal glass or alchemy workshop, it is worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five days later, Kaimo finally saw the owner of this letter - the lord of Bentham Town, Roland Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the castle living room, he just finished his work, but his ass has not yet stabilized, and he can’t wait to say: "His Royal Highness, I want to be good with your alchemist." Talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My Alchemist?" The other smiled. "Before you came, there was no alchemist in Bianbu Town. But now, you It’s my alchemist.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You mean... those alchemy formulas are written by you?” Camo directly ignored his post In the half sentence, my face became a little pale. He suddenly thought of another possibility. The other party is a prince. All the knowledge he received came from the teaching of the court tutor. If he could know this, wouldn't the Wangdu Alchemy Association master the essence of alchemy change? And I still want to be above them, and it’s ridiculous to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not exactly," Roland said. "These formulas come from ancient books more than four hundred years ago. I also discovered them by chance. It seems to be in the hundreds." Years ago, they called alchemy "chemistry." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"化... Learn? "Kemo heard that the formula was not from the Wangdu Alchemy Association. I felt a lot in my heart, but the answer given by the prince still surprised him. Alchemy books more than 400 years ago? You must know the Wangdu Alchemy Association. Is it a history of less than two hundred years, is it not as good as the predecessors?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, in the book, those scholars mentioned a hypothesis, that is, matter Do not destroy. The substances that make up everything in the world will not disappear or increase. They just change from one form to another, such as this piece of cake." Roland pointed to the cake on the long table. "After you eat your stomach, there are Some of them are absorbed by you, and some are excreted. If the absorbed part is added to the part excreted, their mass should be equal. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
