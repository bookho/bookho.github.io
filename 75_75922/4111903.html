			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Count of Losey! The damn traitor, how dare he--!" On the top of the castle, watching the battle of Anpein violently jumped like a thunder, "I want to kill him." And his son! Minister, where is my minister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, the Cologne adult said before going to ... to handle something," For a while, the pro-healing man hesitated and replied, "But I think he may not come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" Turned sharply and gasped for the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You agreed at the time," said the patriarch, who was hard-headed. "In addition to Cologne, there are also Queen Wright and "Golden Hour". Seoul - Your Majesty, now I am only here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Ann Pein noticed that there were only a long guardian and a few lonely servants in the large hall.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He instantly understood the meaning of "may not come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is another traitor! "The Lord of the morning smashed the scepter to the ground. "One or two is not enough, there are three or four... My career is ruined in the hands of this group of traitors!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their departure has indeed passed their own consent, but what are the reasons? One said to check the defense of the stone wall, one said to go inside The hospital urged the maids to prepare for the war, which was originally their duty. Now it seems that it is a safe haven!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the enemy has not launched an attack? His ministers are ready to flee?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, those cowards will be resigned sooner or later, but now the most urgent task is to evacuate this place as soon as possible! "The pro-warner came forward and advised, "The pro-military soldiers can't delay for a long time, even if it is a guard, they can only resist the enemy for half an hour or so, and it will be too late!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I have to see the traitor paying the price!" "Anpei pushed open the other side," went to the underground cell and brought Otto Rossi's head to me! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the king's command! "He shouted exhaustedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, squat. "The pro-guardian has to step back and take it all out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the only man left, Anpein only felt his fingers tremble slightly, his eyes seemed to be cracking. The whole field of vision was dyed with a layer of light red.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down on the chair and stared at his hands, wishing to use them. Torn the traitors!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is over.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the city’s mercenaries Inexplicably flocked and fled, and the stone wall was handed over, the defeat was already doomed, and the rebellion of Earl Rossi was nothing but an insignificant one. But he did not understand why Count Loshi was willing to risk losing his eldest son. Betrayed him? Why is Horford Quin’s ambition to get two other unreserved support? This is totally incomprehensible – although the three major families of Huiguang City are regarded as a whole, their respective interests are not It’s exactly the same, in the case of a little bit of a bad situation, he can’t think of anyone who can make him They are so trusting.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anpein found that neither the city nor the three families are far from what he thinks. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he did not wait until the pro-health to return.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door to open the hall is one The warriors that the team has never seen, the weapons in their hands are still dripping with blood, and there are a lot of blood stains on the armor. From the other side’s look, there is absolutely no fatigue and slack after the bloody fight, and its relaxed appearance It’s more like a street fight.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro-defense long claimed to resist half an hour, but in fact it failed for a quarter of an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strengths on both sides are too different.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
