			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rushing to the sheep pub, the group quickly obtained the specific location of Mans’s residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to explore the situation, you then enter from the main entrance; in addition, Axia, you look at the lightning and wheat, don't let them both come in," Nightingale Commanded, then spread the fog and disappeared directly into the crowd. In the world of black and white, the lines that make up the outline of everything are distorted. She easily finds the gap that does not exist on the wall and walks through the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furnishings in the house are very simple, not much better than the iron shovel. From the loss of the patrol team, Mans’ life is also very difficult. There was a clear view of the field of vision, and there was no boring stone of punishment nearby. The nightingale quickly found a target in the bedroom - a man was curling up in the bed and snoring, hanging around the bed You can also see the blood on the cuffs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale returned to the living room, opened the door, the police swarmed in, and Mans, who had just awakened from the bed, pressed it back into the bed and tied it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, who are you... let me go!" he shouted in horror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You were arrested for murder, Mans!" Ryan stepped forward and gave him a slap in the face, letting him quiet down, "Dare to dare Confronted with His Royal Highness, hanged at the gate of the city is cheaper!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I don't have..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No?" Earl of Elk changed his slap into a fist. With two muffled sounds, Mans opened his mouth in pain, his mouth was full of blood, and the front teeth were missing one. "You last night. The process of murder has been seen by us. Is there any other sophistry? Use the dream water to faint the iron shovel, don't want to be splashed on the body, and then hang up and then cut the throat, there is a set!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Mans’s unbelievable and deep fear in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mouse that killed the declaring work, draw the cross crown with blood...who is this instructed?" The nightingale picked up a glass bottle from the bed, inside There is a half bottle of light cyan liquid. "Dream water is not cheap, and it is not easy to buy this kind of thing after the mouse gang is annihilated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you honestly explain, maybe there is still a way to live," Rennes squeezed his fist. "Otherwise, I will let you Have a taste of the anger of a nobleman. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale is not stopped, even if she knows that the Earl of Elk is lying. As His Highness said, the security of the territory is the most important, and the person who destroys it should Get enough lessons.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mans is still hesitating, his fist is falling on him again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This time is the abdomen and ribs. Rennes, who has undergone the training of the Cavaliers, is very precise in their strength, which can make the target unbearable and not cause fatal injuries.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I was wrong, I am wrong, please let me go!" It’s a...a guy in the inner city called me to do this! Every time he kills a person, he will pay me four gold dragons. He also said that the public will have resentment against the police. I feel that these black uniforms are unable to protect everyone, and the patrol can be rebuilt! "Mans collapsed, he is not a determined person, or a determined person will not be a patrol member who plunders others." I will not take away four lives for the reward of a few Golden Dragons. The night owl thought, maybe before he started, he wouldn’t think that he would be targeted by the Justice Department so quickly, and he wouldn’t even think that in just four days, someone could He was thrown out of the big city of 20,000 people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He screamed and confessed that the matter was the same, the blood and the nose were full of collars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how he found me. The first time I met was in the pub. He gave me this bottle of dream water, saying that As he said, you can get a lot of money. At that time, I had no savings, and the police force did not accept my application. I hated it... I started. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The police will never accept your dregs," Ryan muttered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
