			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty’s feet slammed into the rain, and the flowing water poured into her nose, mouth and collar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is indescribable, and there is no severe pain on the body, but I can’t afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry about me, kill her!" She couldn't take care of the injury and shouted hoarsely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the reaction of the Japanese made her disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bloody witch fights, hesitating to stop, and finally returned to his side, "You... okay."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idiot! Only by holding them can we reverse the disadvantages, and I will use them without any harm! She wants to vent her anger, but she feels that she has little strength to open her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cry from the flames behind him, and then the fighting voice subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the ashes of the mortal, it is not easy for her to insist on counting time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of paralysis gradually subsided, and a burning sensation came out of the thigh, which was particularly noticeable under the immersion of rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty struggled to look up and saw Andrea coming slowly to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still have to resist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." is answering the calendar She turned and squatted. "I surrender, please don't kill Master Hert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I want to kill her, her head has already blossomed. "Andreia wiped the rain from her forehead. "Now she has a life, because there are still some things that are not understood by His Highness Tilly. When the evidence is conclusive, she will get the punishment she deserves."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sin...certificate?" The day went by, "Annie once sold a bloody witch, and the great talents will do it for her!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? She said this to you? As far as I know, Anne has never entered a bloody meeting," Andrea said with a shrug. "In short, after all the facts are revealed, You will know what kind of person Heti Morgan is." Then she turned her head and shouted at the shadow. "Go and call Pandora, and then she will die if she does not live."<br />< Br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Hedi finally felt the pain - the whole leg could not move at all, like a heavy mass under his body, and the tingling was replaced by a while. The scorching heat also restored her spirit a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is very aware of what will happen next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly dare to do this, it must be learned from one aspect of his own details, as long as there are clues, the witch is not difficult to trace the truth, even the sleepy island witch Can't do it, there are the guys in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid that the problem lies with both Effie and Yu Yu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She still looked down on Tilly’s yellow-haired girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Andrea’s turning back, Herti gritted her teeth to the final strength to release the magic—<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within ten steps, her ability allows the hollow object to collapse from the inside, whether it is a living thing or a container. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She calls it "the power of smashing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure is a foregone conclusion, but Hetty is not willing to make Tilly win so easily, at least to give the guy a profound and unforgettable lesson! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, adults!" I noticed that the movement of her movements exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s late! She laughed in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment of the shot, an invisible barrier dispelled her crushing power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...wearing the stone of God!" Hetty's eyes widened and said vaguely. Wait, what hurts your own is not the other's new ability? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death does not repent, it seems that your strength is quite abundant," Andrea showed a disgusted look, lifted the iron bar and slammed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty only felt a slamming of his head and then fell into the darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is solved," Andrea looked at and was taken away Heti Morgan and Tianyan asked, "What is the situation on your side?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, only Tianyan may not be able to reach us. "Westland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you do with your hands," she said with a look of disappointment. "Isn't Tily adults say as much as possible to leave their lives?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't expect her to use the fight, and the skill is not bad," Ashes licked the rain of the mouth, "I want to give birth to her not to do Not enough, but I am worried that you will miss the key at a critical time. You can only fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You--" Andrea was in a hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what it is. If you light up the glass beads earlier, maybe they won't choose a fight," the witch sighed. If you want to hold a musket, they know what it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want to fight, Tiley is still waiting for your report. "The shadow reluctantly reminded, "And even if you want to fight, don't stand in the rain, what if you really get infected with cold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two looked at each other for a moment, and they blinked each other to end the dispute and returned to the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reporting to Tilly, Andrea noticed her The look is not so good, far from being as relaxed or comfortable as solving the big heart, it feels a little uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Ashes held her hand. "Is it uncomfortable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Tily shook her head. "When I first saw Roland's secret letter, I actually didn't want to believe the above content," her tone sounded sad. "Well, the witch has her own home, why do you still want it?" Is it necessary to repeat the tragedy of the past, is it not safe to live here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have done a good job," Ashes comforted. "Not All fighting witches will unconditionally agree with Hert's set of practices, especially after the improvement of life, some fighting witches have fallen to us, even members of the bloody meeting are no exception."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is right," although she didn't like ashes, but at this time, Andrea didn't want to see Tilly feel sad. "The Japanese did not listen to Herti's command to fight death. Prove that as long as it takes time, everyone will gather together, just like the Witch Alliance."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope so," Tilly took a deep breath. "Since Herti really did, I can't indulge her any more. But according to Iphi, the bloody teeth will Most of the witches don't know about this. I will let Camilla bring them all together later. If they are willing to stay here and wait for the results, don't treat them as enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two nodded, and it’s hard to live in the island. No one wants these people to really separate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the storm is over, we will bring Herti to the West," she continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to fight with the church?" The voice of the ashes was excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Tilly closed her eyes and sighed. "It’s like fighting the judges, the gods, the pures, and even the gods. As Roland said, if the church can be completely defeated, the witch will truly liberate. Even if he is not my brother, I should help him... because that is helping me." She paused. Are you willing to be with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
