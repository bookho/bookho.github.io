			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened there?" During the conversation, Margaret suddenly showed a surprised look. "Joan... What is she doing?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also noticed the small commotion on the side of the hall, and saw the witch friend of the businesswoman actually left the corner, slowly with the help of the maid to the lightning Waiting for someone to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And McMug is going between the two, and seems to be transmitting something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first, Joan’s performance was very tense, and she was almost only willing to stay behind the maid. Only when the pigeons approached, will they find half of the body. But after the two people came together, the situation changed very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She not only had conversations with the witches, but even extended her hands and carefully touched Luo Jia’s ears and tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out," Roland couldn't help but laugh. "It's lightning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This...is too incredible," Margaret said. "Do you know how long it took us to let Joan leave the water? For two months - still with the help of Ms. Carmela." Next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did she do it?" Thunder was also surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She doesn't need to do anything, just use McMug and Luo Jia." Roland laughed. "Joan's heart defense comes from people. Heterogeneous repulsion, but when there are heterogeneous surroundings, this defense naturally does not need to be maintained any longer - whether it is a dove or a wolf girl, I think it is similar in her eyes."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Same class..." Margaret repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, you are not the first to see McMug, and Luo Jia is more similar to Joan," Roland explained. Beastly characteristics, "In short, you don't have to worry about whether she can get together with everyone in the next few months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The name is Luo Jia Witch...hasn’t it been rejected by people?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If not, she won’t come without winter city—even if it’s going to The witch is regarded as the extreme south of the clan goddess, and the appearance of the ordinary person is still considered to be an unknown sign.” Roland shook his head. “Of course, such a contradiction exists in the absence of winter city, but it is not so obvious. As for the witch. The alliance is completely irrelevant. Everyone is a survivor who comes up from the bottom. The essence of the ability is also the clearest. When new sisters arrive, they are too late to come."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unknown is the greatest fear." Thunder exclaimed, "I originally wanted to be the original of the explorer. However, I want to make a big profit, but now I only hope that in the rest of my life, I can take a few more steps outwards. There are too many puzzles that the world needs to solve. If you don’t go out, people will I can only huddle in a small piece of land, and I will be bound by fear throughout my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also the reason I decided to support you," Roland toasted him. Tao, "There is an old saying in us: people will always become as big as their own thoughts. If you think so, you are destined to be remembered by history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Thank you for your praise," Thunder cried and said, "I will do my best in this trip, and I will live up to your expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margaree Then I stared at Joan for a long time, as if I was thinking about something. After a while, I turned back and said to Roland, "I have a ruthless appeal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the expedition, I originally wanted Joan to return to the fjord, The birthplace settled down." She whispered, "The life of the sea is too lonely. I don't want her to go on alone. But now I changed my mind..." Margaret paused. "Your Majesty, I can Will you entrust her to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean - leave her in the winter city? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it is the fjord environment, Joan is afraid that he can only be active in a small area and talk to a very small number of people. And at your disposal, she can at least make a real companion. "The businesswoman nodded. "After all, I took her away from the familiar sea and couldn't lose her trust. Now I feel that there is no better place than you." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With your words, I am relieved," Margaret was pleased to mention the skirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lily yawned back to the bedroom, drying the wet towel on the hanger, and was about to look through the biobook for a while before going to sleep, but there was a mystery of the mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Lost... Lost... Lost..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned over White-eyed, pretending that I didn't hear the general, I didn't move to open the page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the voice of the other party is much bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The detectives lost... The detectives lost... The detectives lost..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You are finished!" Lilyton felt the blues on her forehead and jerked back. "Have you sleep well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" We lost, "Mystery month is holding a pillow, and my face is unwilling." Don't you feel heartache? I originally thought about how to win over her, but the result is a loss. See how they communicate. It’s not like how you can understand each other. How did you do this? Did they know it before? The number of expeditions is exactly the same as that of the detectives. The title of the first group is also...”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a failure, clearly that the other party has not yet contributed, you have already lost, "Why should I have a heartache? Who is with us is!" Lily interrupted, "I Once again, the detectives had only three people at the beginning. Now the challenge is lost. The number is still less than the other party. It’s a failure. You It’s early to disband!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she said, she snorted and moved her eyes back to the book, and decided that no matter how the other party interfered, she would never Take care of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the mystery month did not continue to entangle, and quietly behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has some uneasiness in her heart, is it too much for herself? Although this guy is annoyed, the starting point is good. If it is not a trouble, Joan does not know how long it will take to get along with everyone. In addition to the embarrassing conversations, the conversations were not wrong, and they did not cause other losses... might you be too harsh? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, a heavier thought jumped into her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery This guy is different from her. She used to be very cautious, and because of her ability problems, she was not scolded by Hakkar along the way. people. Now, the other party is not easy to become cheerful and lively. Will it be resentful because of her blame? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lily suddenly regretted it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swallowed and slowly turned around, and the words of apology had already come to her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what caught her in her eyes was a ten-yuan volume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw that the other party did not know when she touched her behind her, and raised her hands, and carefully handed the paper money to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing?" Lily was shocked by this move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please don't leave the detective group, I would like to use a bottle of chaotic drinks in exchange!" Mystery Month frowns, "If you even go, the detective The group has never had a chance to turn over!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that I am not, listen to people and do not work - Lily helplessly, the heart is also slightly I was relieved, but fortunately, this guy was not as vulnerable as she thought when she released her nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence for a long while, she reached out and took the other's ten-volume. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You promised?" Mystery Month was overjoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Lily knocked on the table. "There are a lot of things I have to do, there is no time to accompany you to the noise. But I can give you A reminder, and this banknote is a reward. If you don't take up my working hours in the future, I can also help your detective group to make some ideas, at least better than pulling a strange witch."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
