			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What the hell is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central atmosphere, the atmosphere in the air It looked quite dignified. The chief commander stared at the map on the long table. The eyebrow wrinkles became a deep ditch. "There is no red line or no omen. Is it so many devils are out of thin air!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the first time the alarm was sounded, the First Army combat troops were already there, but the confusion and uneasiness still permeated everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that this is a change that occurred under the warning of Sylvie. If there is no witch, is this not a fight? If the enemy can suddenly appear eight kilometers away, will it appear directly in the camp next time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the question is not clearly identified, no one can let it go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the tent, the fortress gun that had been quiet for half a night re-emerged with a thunderous roar, and the rate of fire increased to a peak - there is no saving of artillery It is necessary to reduce the enemy's vitality as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s impossible to change it," Ai Gesha said. "The red fog is a necessity for the devil to survive. This has not changed. Otherwise, they have swept the whole world long ago. Now the number of enemies is close to 10,000. There is no replenishment of the red line, let alone fight, and they can all have their lives!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "According to previous information, the size of this outpost can support more than a thousand devil activities," the iron axe indulged for a moment. "As you mean, there is still a supply point near us, but the magic eye does not. Found its existence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only think so-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, still There is a possibility," Itis interrupted. "Since we can make the supply line disappear from the surface, the devil may also think of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ruins of Takira dig a tunnel?" Ai Gesha shook her head again and again. "Don't say if they have a worm carrier, light. The passage that can serve more than a thousand devils is not a small project, which is not the same as the time when they first appeared in Takira. Not to mention such a big movement, Sylvie will be able to detect the difference."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't mean to start from your hometown," said Itis, who clicked on the map to be marked as a cross, "If they only started from the outpost." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" asked the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't think... is the position of the devil really awkward?" She rolled up the falling hair. "Think about it, if we are a The regular army - whether it is a human aristocrat or a witch empire, what is the current situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the questioning of the North Pearl, the people present They all turned their attention to the map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who can enter the central big account, not the staff of the staff department, is the commander of the military and the representative of the Allied Army. No one is unresponsive - soon, everyone I thought of a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big account suddenly sounded a cold breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this commotion was quickly overshadowed by the rumble of gunfire outside the tents - in the tremors of the earth, the participants saw the surprise in each other's eyes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the shelling sounds, Xiaochen Chenguang broke the silent road. "You mean...the outpost is the bait set by the devil?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the regular army, to destroy this outpost, you must reach the siege war, which means that they handed the road to the devil. When the other party reappeared at this time, it formed a natural double-team with the ruins of Takira. Under the attack on both sides, the first army’s end can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two kilometers of battlefield, just to accommodate the two sides of the war, from the map, its battle is like a huge pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will make sure we will come?" asked the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with most people, Zoe’s look has hardly changed. His face seems to be always indifferent. “If it is a federation, then it will definitely take action. Letting the devil build an outpost is equal to disregarding the expansion of the bloodline. It’s a suicide for the witch – the fall of a city, always starting with the inability to stop the enemy from expanding.” She paused. “Just, they have never done this before.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The times are different," Beidi Pearls, "This way, it can explain a lot of problems. The devil does not think that mortals can go all out to threaten the beast squad, then No winter city is bound to be a witch city, so this trap is set up. If you are lucky, you can even get out of the battle witches in the city. In order to let us enter the ambush circle, the devil not only gave up halfway attacks, but also actively shrank the scope of investigation. For the moment when the pockets are closed - what do you think, what about this assumption?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if this is the case, how does the devil escape Hill?" Miss investigation? "Sir Syrte in the offing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You may not know, her ability is not omnipotent." Isis replied, "If I remember correctly, her look and distance There is a considerable gap between the distances, plus the presence of fearful beasts, she usually can only observe at extreme distances - in this case, the eye of the magic may have overlooked a large area."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, everyone has faintly guessed the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I am not blaming Miss Sylvie," Itis sighed. "But we are too dependent on her."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic power is always a problem that witches can't ignore. In order to grasp the enemy's movements as much as possible, Sylvie needs to be vigilant all the time, using every magic power carefully. . The see-through formation consumes a lot, especially from the long-distance bird's-eye view in the sky, so it is obviously impossible to dig the entire fertile plains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the principle that the devil can only lurk in the red fog area, she should only scan the stratum around the outpost - and is limited by the line of sight, the depth estimate is also Not too deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha frowned. "We can verify this now." Then she activated the listening print, "Silvi, you can see Is the situation under the ground of the Devil's army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Underground?" Sylvia, who was guiding the shelling, gave a slight glimpse. "I can try it, but the magic... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." The voice of the seal is quiet. After a few seconds, then everyone heard her exclaimer, "Weird... The eyes of the devil's eyes are blocked - I can't see anything, only the darkness!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t help but stunned, and this result is tantamount to confirming Itis’s speculation from the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taste of being counted by the enemy is obviously not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time, there was only a roar of artillery in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪,啪,啪."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the iron axe suddenly slammed Hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the case, so I can rest assured." He slowly opened his mouth. "In the end, who is the prey, you have to rely on this hard battle. Decided."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a little bit good, the general commander," Isis smiled. "Although they guessed the wrong opponent, they did not. And it can only be said that the luck on both sides is not bad. Or, we are even better. Is it not the battle we hope to face the enemy on the premise battlefield? The shelling in the evening makes them incompetent. The first time to take action, and now the devil not only lost the bait, but also face the prepared sniper, how to see is a good start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North The pearls paused for a moment. "In fact, as I said at the beginning, we don't have to pay attention to the enemy's intentions. No matter what they want to do, just kill all the daring outs - and that's exactly what it is. The first army is good at it, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
