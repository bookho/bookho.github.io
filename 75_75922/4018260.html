			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This idiot daughter!" The Northern Duke Calvin grabbed the table. The teacup wants to fall to the ground, and halfway down and stop - the cup is made of good crystal glass, almost two or three gold dragons, he is a bit reluctant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After thinking for a long time, I slowly retracted my hand and put the cup back in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling of suffering and loss made his heart more depressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter written by Itis was spread out on the table - he never thought that his majesty would directly recover all the powers of the nobility, even more unexpected The usual daughter who can always take advantage of him for a cheaper meal should have taken down the conditions of his Majesty, and advised himself to recognize the situation and not to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;瞧瞧This word means that he seems to be a prisoner! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke hated to think, this is the daughter who turned her elbows out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, what happened?" The guard outside the door probably heard the noise, the probe asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roll, don't bother me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reluctant to vent the cup, Calvin immediately put The anger vented to the guard, and the door was quickly shut down. He gasped for a long time before he moved his eyes back to the letterhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you follow the King’s Majesty, you will not be the owner of the North, at least not as it is now. Just solved the cleanliness of the House and the Lista family, and finally managed to enjoy the feeling of being in charge of the whole world. I did not expect to return to the original point soon - no, it should be a step back from the original point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you not follow it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I will finish with Cole, he will be imprisoned forever in prison, just like the heir to the Duke of Lane. And my end will only be worse. How do you think the former Four Princes would treat a woman who couldn’t resist the Duke? I can think of all the humiliating ways that make men excited. When he gets tired, I will be thrown into the dungeon. Or military camp, your Northland pearls will be dusty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But don't worry about me, because you can't go anywhere, father. His army Soon the soldiers will be under the city, I bet your vassals and knights can't hold it for a long time, don't say the duke, even ordinary civilians can't do it. How do you make this choice?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Familiar tone--Calvin can even imagine the expression of sneer at the time Itis wrote this letter. Whenever she talks about failure, she always describes her end in a very calm tone, as if she is waiting for the day. As long as the daughter opened up to this aspect, it would be difficult for him to be able to stand up again. It is obviously a threat, but Calvin has never been able to raise the temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, Itis Kant is his own daughter, and the only crystal of his first wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although her tone is quite exaggerated, there is no denying the possibility of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the prince's style, he often heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, the Duke gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, are those dark steel machines really amazing as she said? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the three letterheads, the daughter used a full page to describe her in Bianbu Town - no, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than twice as much as Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She claims that they have unimaginable power and can easily do things that ordinary people can’t achieve. As long as they rely on the new king, Northland can introduce these. The territory brings a black iron behemoth that has changed dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she also suggested that he send a formal vows to his Majesty to express the meaning of surrender in the North, and at the same time send some literate servants to learn the rules and administrative methods of the City Hall, so as to avoid having to have nothing to do with the emerging system. know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, I hope that you can clearly and unambiguously instruct Cole to stay in the winter city, instead of letting him come back in a moment - so there is no such thing as him. Benefits. If you can, I will send him when he is an adult. If the title cannot be inherited, only the people who adapt to the New Deal can continue the Kant family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--Your daughter, Itis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calvin sighed and collected the letter and spread a new one. White paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Isis has made a decision, he has to believe her intentions, write a letter to His Majesty, and loyalty to the new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as a duke, he must be able to make his final efforts in his own way - if you can tie the interests of the two together, Carl The text will undoubtedly be much more secure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example... Let her daughter be a queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp There is no winter city border area, next to the Chishui River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is falling into the mountains a little bit, and the river is dyed into a brilliant golden color through the afterglow of the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequently smoked from the shack, if there is no porridge, the snake has drooled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closer, he even smelled a trace of meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am here!" Just entering the camp, the tiger claws saw him, "Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snake teeth walk to him, "Why, is there meat today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you came back too late to miss the notice, This is a reward for the Lord of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake’s teeth licked some numb shoulders, “What do you reward? The residential area on your side is still early "It's very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the completion of the Kingdom Road!" Someone gathered around and said, "The Bianbu District and the Changge District are finally connected together and listen to them." It said that it would take three days to travel. Now, if you ride a horse, you can arrive in one day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original snakehead nodded whenever a major project was completed. They can drink a bowl of meat porridge - like the propaganda on the square, two months into the Bianbu District, the construction team did not have to send a food, and did not deduct any compensation. Now he has accumulated 14 silver wolves in his hands, and by the end of this month, there are still seven more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can make a golden dragon, he can get a house in the town hall, thus becoming an official resident of the winter city, no longer no name Mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you want to actually buy that house, he will have to work for at least twenty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Snake has the confidence to find a higher-paying job later... such as a kiln worker or a mason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything seems to be really moving in the right direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only regret is that he still hasn't seen the blank paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you get the meat porridge, remember to eat faster," the tiger claw whispered in his ear. "Otherwise, I won't be able to grab a good position." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What...Location?" Snakes confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to celebrate the completion of the Kingdom Avenue, there is a new drama tonight in the square. I heard that it is called "City of Love", and the star of the West will also appear, God... ...I can't wait!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
