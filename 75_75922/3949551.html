			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the white paper is washed, wring the towel and hang it on a snow-covered balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as one day, the towel will be completely frozen. When it is used again the next day, just knead it repeatedly and remove the ice residue. Of course, she can also use the ability to quickly evaporate water in a warm room, but this will reduce the number of exercises per day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White paper knows that the magic in your body is counted as a countdown in the witch, so each one must be used accurately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was knocked out after cleaning. Almost every day at this time, Wendy sister will take her to the castle hall for breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coming soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White paper opens the door cheerfully, standing outside Sure enough, Wendy - she picked herself up intimately and sniffed on her cheek. "Well, yes, it’s clean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿嘿." The white paper squinted and pulled Wendy's hand toward the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been nearly half a month since I came to Bianbu Town. She is used to the lifestyle in the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t have to leave the shack early to find food, don’t worry about the firewood being stolen, and spend all your time filling your stomach and heating. Instead, it is magic practice and learning. This kind of life, she only fantasized when chatting with her companions, can not worry about survival at all, I am afraid that only the sons and ladies of the big aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White paper did not expect that he would have such a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty’s palms are soft and warm, this feeling has never been experienced in a slum, just like someone always remembers and cares for himself... she hopes Always stay in this warm place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a dream, she would rather never wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the hall, the white paper saw that the witches did not always sit at the long table to eat, but surrounded by a wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blinked curiously, but was embarrassed to ask Wendy what they were doing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter seems to see through her thoughts, laughing. "Sisters are testing their "combat power." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Combat power? "The white paper is slightly stunned. "That is... what? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The eccentric rhetoric that comes out of His Royal Highness, you don't have to care," Wendy bent down and lifted the little girl up on her shoulder. Did you see the silver-white metal piece? It is said to be the relic of the Witch Kingdom for more than four hundred years, and it is also the weapon used by the supernaturals to fight. Only the powerful person can activate it. So the Highness put it In the hall, so that everyone can test their level of magic, or ... to satisfy the curiosity of the sisters - one can illuminate the four magic stones in one breath, which is equivalent to one-minded combat power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." White paper feels extremely confused, the witch kingdom? Extraordinary? Magic stone? The words that I have never heard before make her feel puzzled for a while, but this does not affect the shock brought by the scene in front of me - I saw the witches take turns to put their hands on the metal sheet, so that the gemstones inlaid on it are embarrassing. The light, like a colorful star, looks incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can light up two yeah," shouted at lightning of his own age, her shoulder still holding a fat pigeon, remembering on white paper It was also a witch, and it seemed to be called Mai Mai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two and a half!" The pigeon screamed triumphantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, are you actually higher than me? This is impossible!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also Want to try?” Wendy laughed. “I don’t know how to do it now. You haven’t learned how to inject magic into the magic stone, let alone activate the seal. But your Highness rules that this is a course that witches must take, so you quickly There will also be a glowing stone for practice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, boy," Wendy smiled and rubbed her cheek. "First eat, eat hard and practice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking the porridge, the white paper returned to the Witch House and began daily practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter tells her that everything in this world is made up of small balls that are invisible, and that material changes are also the separation and joining of small balls. Your ability is to speed up the process, not simply melting the ice or letting the hot water cool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I can’t quite understand the meaning of these words, she still meticulously follows the requirements of Wendy, feels the magic contained in her body, and releases it evenly. -- The slum life of the early years made her understand that she can live a good life with everyone because the power of the witch is needed by His Royal Highness. This is also her only value. If she wants to be abandoned, she must do her best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the white paper felt a pain in the abdomen, and the magic trembled in the body, as if to break through, she couldn’t help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Wendy asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, nothing," she shook her head. "The magic just seems to be out of control."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Uncontrolled..." The other person thought for a moment, "Do you remember when you became a witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably winter, "White paper whispers, "I can't remember the specific days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's already late autumn, and it's not a few days before winter. Wendy converges with a smile. "After the awakening day, the magic of the body will become active. This is also a sign of reflexion. You should rest first, I will call the nightingale, and she can see the magical changes in your body." "She went to the door and went back and added, "Reassure, for the witches in Bianbu Town, this is not a life-and-death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter’s guess was confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White paper ushered in its second awakening day three days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lay on the big bed, looking at the witches around to visit, listening to their words and comforting their words, suddenly there was a tear Impulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain of being burned by magic in the first awakening of memory seems to have become less unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because your practice time is short, you can't guarantee that you will completely eliminate the pain of reflexion," Wendy said, sitting on the bed and stroking her hair. "But Compared to the suffering of adulthood, this pain is nothing, you can be patient. Remember, don't give up the idea, and you can't let yourself lose consciousness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nod to white paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t dare to answer her words, fearing that once she opened her mouth, she couldn’t help but bring out crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t want everyone to see how humiliating they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When living in a slum, crying is the weakest performance, and only those who give up the struggle will make this move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White paper closes your eyes and waits for the moment to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she opened her eyes, the window was white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-phagic process is much weaker than she imagined, so that the various rescue methods that everyone has prepared are not used. When she woke up, she felt that the magic of the body was full, and the whole body seemed to have undergone subtle changes. The eyes could see farther and the hands and feet were more powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When cleaning the cheeks, Wendy’s knocking on the door sounded on time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am coming," the white paper happily opened the door and pulled her hand, but this time the other did not take myself to the castle hall, but went On the third floor, the office of the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
