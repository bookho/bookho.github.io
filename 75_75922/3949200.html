			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Anna's sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa heard the steps from the stairs Sound, busy running to the door and looking at the probe, but disappointed to find that the person is the Prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is still working, probably coming later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Work?" Nanawa recently heard the word from the prince's mouth. "Do you mean burning those gray mud?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the moment, this is the case. "Nowa pouted back to the table, and I also had a job. She thought, stay here and treat those who were injured in defending the town." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, Anna is not there, is it boring?" Roland smiled and pulled out the chair and sat by the fireplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Nanawa held her chin and was honest. She didn't want to treat those injured, just...just, it was terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembers the first time she treated Brian, who was soaked in blood, the reddish-brown blood clots solidified in the chest, and the mouth was like dehydration The fish, one by one, spit out red and white blood. Then... I fainted myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really shameful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa looked up and sneaked at Roland and found that he had leaned against the chair and snorted. It seems that the prince is also tired. She thinks that building the city walls, training the soldiers, and protecting the town from the evil beasts are also his work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he asked to come here, she hesitated for a long time, but she did not refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will also encounter something that will make you want to live, even if you are struggling to live." - Nana Va does not understand this. The meaning of the sentence, but when I close my eyes, Anna will appear in her mind - the blue eyes are like the lake, slowly surrounded her, which is why she promised Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to be as strong as Anna’s sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a footstep sounding downstairs, and Nanawa jumped out of the chair and wanted to see if this was when Anna came back, but she was Only the invisible hand stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly wait, more than one person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa patted the chest, dissatisfied "You scared me, night sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was quickly pushed open, and was responsible for the second floor of Brian, "Miss Pine. Please take a trip and someone is burnt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, have to work? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa took a deep breath, "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went downstairs The two guards were busy carrying a non-stop screaming man to the bed, standing next to a small man with an anxious face. Brian stepped forward and tied the injured hands and feet to the bedside. The guards then set up the small man and walked out of the room. He also handed the curtain for the partition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Roland squinted and went downstairs and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Highness, the North Slope Mine sent a seriously wounded person, it looks like it was burnt."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince walked over and glanced at him. "It’s a steam burn. The first machine won’t go wrong? What about the people who sent him?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In the foyer," Brian pointed to the direction of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will ask the situation, I will hand it over to you," said Roland, who went to the exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa slowly squatted to the man and used the light to aim. I saw that the facial features on his face were all in a mess. The red skin should have turned into a pale white after dehydration, and it was hung on the face like a rag. The neck is full of large bowls of bubbles, some of which have been broken, and the exuded mucus is soaked with blood on the pillow. Under the swaying fire, his appearance is even more terrible than the devil in the nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
