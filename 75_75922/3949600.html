			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big Brother, this... Is this really good?" The firehead touched the cloth on the body with some uneasiness, "Chief Knight said, uniform. It is our status symbol, we must wear neatly on duty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And it is punished if it is dirty, not to mention wearing it at all," the whistle does not Stopping the ground and looking around, like being afraid of being seen by peers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Donâ€™t be embarrassed, wearing is enough to symbolize, Black Bronze is standing in the snow for a long time, hundreds of steps know that there is a policeman there, how "Watching people?" Vader spit. "You are a Bianbu town, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said one, two Suddenly came the spirit. "My father is an hunter. He used to live in the old street. The technology is good. He can shoot the fox in the woods." &nbsp;&nbsp; "I am also, the old man always said that hunting is unstable, it is better to mine, he even prepared me for the hoe. If it is not the prince of the prince to become the lord, I am afraid I have to stay in the mine. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be seen," Wade shrugged, and only the children of the Orion family would take such a nickname, "Since it is a small town, it is better than Should I be more concerned about the order of the town? Even I am not afraid of punishment. Are you afraid of anything, is it more serious than maintaining the rules set by your Highness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." The two men hesitated for a moment before they made up their minds. "You are also speaking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"And Big Brother, you are not an outsider, have you already got your ID card. Your Highness said that all the people who got this card are his people." The whistle muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid smiled, stopped talking, and continued to stare at a row of caves on the east side of the temporary residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a police officer for nearly three months, he has fully adapted to life in the West. The "patrol team" that originally thought that it would not defraud and not defraud basically had nothing to do, but did not expect that things that were busy every day could not be completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receiving refugees requires the police, handling civil disputes requires the police, and even arresting those vicious criminals and spies is actually the task of the police... and the first army seems to be apart from In addition to fighting the evil beast, he did not intervene in the security operations in the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very different from what he originally envisioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jinsuicheng, the patrol is almost a supplement to the city guards, taking on some dirty work, but the benefits are not much, which is also the habit of many players. Additional reasons for looking for windfalls. But in Bianbu Town, the police and the First Army are more like systems that are not related to each other. The former is internal and the latter is external. What is more surprising to Vader is that their target of action is more than the direct designation of the superior, and more reports from the people - yes, the town Residents have changed his perception of ordinary people. These lazy and stupid people will take the initiative to target those suspicious people and report them to the City Hall. Whenever a foreign merchant ship arrives in a small town, the Ministry of Justice will always receive five or six such reports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vader quickly realized the enormous power contained in it - no spies can be completely out of touch with the outside world, or fully integrated into the aborigines as soon as they arrive Among them, unless he grew up there. When everyone becomes a vigilant post, what other enemies can hide? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course not every arrest will have results, like the sneaky ones caught in the last attack, the result is actually the nobility of the morning. Vader was prepared to be punished, but he did not respond at all. It seemed that he had turned a blind eye to his beatings of the nobility, which strengthened his view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Gold" appeared! "The fire is whispering.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care for him, pretend to be snow-sweeping," Vader said quietly. "He didn't bring the goods, just To investigate the situation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold is the code name for this arrest target - the Ministry of Justice received reports two days before, and the serfs were in private food, and Carter was very Pay attention to it, immediately give the task to him, ask people to get it and get it, and call it a gold hunting action.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
