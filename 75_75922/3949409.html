			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The granite steps of the Yongdu Wangdu Temple have been stained with blood The sweet taste in the air is a bit pungent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many corpses lying on the ground--there are gods, devotees, and own people, as well as Mojins. They are all dead, most of them have burnt marks, broken limbs and internal organs are everywhere. Farion knew that it was the impact and burning of the dead snow powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time he steps up, he feels a sticky feeling at his feet. The will of the church and the believers can be described as crazy. In the face of the many slaves who have been strengthened by drugs, they still do not retreat. They use the flesh as a shield to entangle the enemy, just to fight for a fatal blow to their companions. Opportunity - Although the pills can make people full of strength and fear of pain, the heart, neck and head are still the key points, and the Queen has no extra armor to arm these cheap slaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no snow powder, the battle may not be really good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we won... Farion’s heart is as hot as fire, and we are winning! The flag of the Queen of the Waters has been flying in the city, and the strongest defense of the church has not been able to resist this attack. As a result, the Black Sail fleet got rid of the stagnation of the corner of the Grey Fort, and did not have to be exhausted in a little bit of exhaustion with Tiefco's endless war of attrition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is in the hall of the temple. The ground is full of shattered glass fragments and cross-flowing blood, but he does not care about it, go straight to that name. Standing in the middle of the hall, in front of the woman who is flying high, she kneels down on one knee. "Your majesty, the four gates have all fallen into the hands of the black sail, and the king of Yongdong is yours."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Work hard, get up." Garcia handed his hand to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farion gently held the Queen's hand, a symbolic kiss on the back of the finger, then got up and stood on the side of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strange etiquette," Kabbah said on the side of the cold, "You didn't touch her hand at all, why did you want this look?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is so abrupt that he can't help but frown, but the other is the patriarch of the sandstone clan, and he is not good to publicly blame her for being rude, so cold Channel: "This is a common etiquette between the nobles, representing courtesy and respect. It is rude to meet. It is normal for you to understand the sand people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is it?" She raised her eyebrows and pointed at her neck. "It is obviously an ally of allies. Just after the end of the battle, I will put this kind of thing on me. The courtesy and respect of the mainland people are still It’s really confusing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaba’s neck is surrounded by a circle of iron bars that bulge in the middle and look like an ornament, but Farrell I know that there is a stone of God's punishment. In addition to the special key, it is difficult to unlock the iron bars by other means, and the key is in the hands of Garcia. The other party is a witch, naturally she should be cautious, but she does have a lot of effort in the battle. Without her command, the slaves with strong snow powder are afraid to rush to the strict defense formed by the believers. He opened his mouth but didn't know how to refute it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, don't argue for this little thing," Garcia interrupted. "Don't forget the purpose of our visit - compared to the vast existence You can't stand a stone even?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just said it," Kabbah shrugged. "I hope you can cash you." Commitment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is the basis of our cooperation," the Queen smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do next to Black Sail?" Fareen asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next step is to say later, let us watch the show first." Garcia clap his hands and tell the pro-guard, "Bring her up." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the two armored guards pressed a woman who was tied with both hands into the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is about thirty years old, looks ordinary, a brown messy scattered on the sides of her cheeks, wearing a golden church robes. This kind of exquisite workmanship and material-style clothing is generally only worn by the bishop of Hermes. At this moment, there are several broken pieces on the gorgeous robes, and the surrounding area is stained with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” said Miss Bishui, who raised her lips. “I have already confirmed it to the local nobility. She is one of the three bishops of the church, Heather.” She turned her eyes to each other. “How, I’m right. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Heather did not answer, but Farion could see deep ridicule and disdain from her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, Garcia also felt this. She chuckled twice. "I also think that you will not surrender, so in the spirit of kindness, I put You bring it to the temple and send you back to the kingdom of God here. You can slowly plead for the redemption of the gods, or you can ask me for forgiveness. I will cut your fingers, limbs and facial features a little bit, so that you can fully Experience the pain and helplessness of the people in the clear water port."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then?" The female bishop unexpectedly said, "Is the army of the church crushed into powder? Said that I plan to drift over the sea forever, never to land?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to worry about this," Garcia gestured to the guards, "compared, The army of the church is now attacking the city of Wolfheart. Hermes is like an undefended city, which is more important than my destiny. I may not be able to set foot on the land of the new holy city, but under the plateau The old holy city can still be ruined. You should have heard of the Styx water in the southern tip of the Grey Fort. It is easy to ignite. It’s hard to be extinguished. I brought a whole boat this time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard pulled out the dagger and approached the bishop who was pressed to the ground, clean and neat Cut her two fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather bit his teeth and didn’t make a cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Waters set foot on the main staircase of the hall, sitting on the wide throne, holding the chin with his right hand, showing a cheerful expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......There are three fingers. At this time, the opponent’s left hand has become a bare pulp, and Heather’s sweat on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have to do this?" Kabbah shook his head. "If it is not to shock the enemy or torture the intelligence, such pure torture is unnecessary." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need?" Garcia laughed. "You should tell her this, know that the witches who are in the hands of the church will be How do they treat them? I guess you won't be interested in knowing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha..." At this moment, Heather lost his fingers Suddenly laughed. "You don't understand the greatness of the church. You don't understand how important the Holy City is. You are always with ignorance, but you don't know about the coming destruction! Hermes will let What you see is what is the real power - the person who is against the church, except for destruction, has no second ending!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Garcia raised her legs and smiled. "Then I will wait and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the Archbishop dies, Have mercy shouted a word. But what surprised Fryen was that she did not shout the name of God and sent her to the redemption of the gods. In the end, when Heather lost too much blood and was about to lose consciousness, his expression was cold and terrible. It was not like being punished. Instead, he was watching a farce that had nothing to do with her. Through the eyes, Faryon looked as if To the future that I have been destined for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling made him feel inexplicably depressed, almost almost breathless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cut her first grade and hang it at the door of the church," Garcia said after confirming the death of the bishop. Then she looked at Farinne. "Then we can talk about the next step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty," he forced the discomfort in his heart. "Would you like to attack Hermes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but not the whole army." She spread a map of the leather she carried with her. "On the Black Sail fleet, only a small number of sailors and some Eastern slaves were left behind. The fleet was steered along the river and headed for the old holy city. And we went straight south, crossed the Yongdong border, and the destination was the Wolf Heart City." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf...heart?" Farion stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I reached an agreement with Wolf King Wolf," Garcia said bluntly. "If he can help him defeat the attack of the church, he will assist me." In the whole winter, if the church does not withdraw the army, the strong snow powder and the Styx water loaded on the ship can make the old holy city into the sea of ​​fire - unlike the new holy city, it is a city without walls, not enough The manpower cannot stop the slaves from attacking in all directions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
