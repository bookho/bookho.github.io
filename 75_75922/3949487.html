			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tilly Adult!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Nightingale, walk into the Lord's Castle, the Five Kings I didn't expect the first one to come out to meet with Sylvie. She ran to herself happily, didn't go up, and bent over to hug herself. "How come you are, it's still autumn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" There is no difference between winter and winter," Tilly laughed. "What about other people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lian is building a house for the fugitives, Evelyn and candlelight At this point, they should still be in the industrial area, honey is training the messenger in the back garden," Sylvia said with his fingers. "His Royal Highness has sent people to inform them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, I think you will see them soon," a sound that sounded familiar but strange, sounded from behind Sylvie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly looked up, a gray-haired man was smiling at himself, his appearance and memory did not change much, smile and look It’s completely no longer the feeling of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to Bianbu Town, my dear sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly’s thoughts surged, she had too many doubts to blurt out, but her face remained calm, followed by Roland Wimbledon into a look Like a study room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please sit down," the other party poured a cup of warm black tea and handed it to himself. "I haven’t seen it for a whole year. I know that you have a lot of words and want me." Talk, I am the same...but don't worry," he looked at the snow outside the window. "This winter is still very long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She holds The cup, without answering the words, sat on the red wooden table and looked at the four princes quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the opening remarks of the light, Tilly felt that it was not the brother of the impression that he could say - he was weak and timid, and the outside was strong, and the most important thing was to get used to escaping. Never think of a positive response. In front of this, Roland Wimbledon is completely different. He is trying to control the initiative of the dialogue. Although the tone is soft and gentle, it is completely the master of the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night," Roland is biased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Your Highness..." The voice of the witch was led in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, she is my sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Night Silence After a while, I showed up and walked out of the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only me and you now," he smiled and returned to the square table,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly is silent for a moment, "Who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought that the other person would hesitate, or pretend to be a mystery, did not expect him The answer was very quick. "I am your brother, Roland Wimbledon, and the four princes of the Grey Fort." Then he smiled. "I know that I have changed a lot, but I am willing to explain it to you slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly suddenly remembered what he wrote in the letter--"As for what made me make this decision, what made me no longer like the past?" Everything is indifferent, and these trivial things can be elaborated when they have a chance." It is this sentence that prompted her to make up her mind to come to this remote town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but raise her mouth. “I will listen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole story Not complicated, but very exciting, after listening to Roland's entire experience after being sealed to Bianbu Town, Tilly found that her teacup was empty. She took a long breath and revisited the narrative. Simply put, a witch named Anna touched Roland. Through the rescued witch, he saw the evil of the church and the confusion of the people. Then Garcia's assassination made him feel the darkness of the royal power. Even if he was hiding in the corner, he still couldn't escape the maliciousness. He finally decided to change it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section sounds a bit dramatic, but it is barely an explanation, but the problem is that the strange knowledge, whether it is a steam engine or a musket, is impossible. I know because of the momentary feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
