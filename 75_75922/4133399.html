			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the hall, Roland was the first to see this famous actor and playwright. His hair has been half-white, and his cheeks are mostly surrounded by fluffy beards. His body is a black dress with irons, and the tie is so meticulous. It is like a figure coming out of a portrait, full of rich atmosphere of the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you hang his big head on the classroom wall, there are no disagreements in the bottom with two famous celebrities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the age is already big, the other’s eyes are still stunned. After the ceremony, his gaze has been on Roland’s body. Do not avoid. Obviously for the drama master, it is not the first time that the royal family has been interviewed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, he is Lord Kajin Fez," Barov said with a sigh. "The highest achievement of the Grey Fortress drama, its reputation is The four kingdoms have a certain influence. In the old kingdom, I was also a frequent visitor to the Central Grand Theatre, in order to appreciate the performance of the Kajin Theatre."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Look at you happy... Roland secretly licked his mouth, and it is already the hand of the king. Can't be more stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To pay tribute to you, Wimbledon squats." Kajin raised his chest. "I think I may know now that you have not been able to see the new drama." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Roland sat on the main seat, "talk and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You...too young." Kajin replied slowly. "Younger than beyond my imagination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean, If you don’t have a certain experience, you can’t appreciate the drama you wrote?” If you first became the lord of Bentham Town, I heard that this kind of meaningful answer, he was afraid that he had already revealed the color of dissatisfaction. However, staying in this position for a long time, the language confrontation is now difficult to make Roland care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the slow tone still shows his attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The side of Barov is already secretly giving Karkin a sneak peek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Your Majesty, I am young, not about the age, but the state of mind." Kajin Fiss shook his head. "It's not from At the beginning of the zero, it is not at the end of one hundred. I have seen many aristocrats who are in their prime, but the spirit is old. The same people who enter the leap year may not really grow old.” He laughed at himself when he said it. Laugh, "I thought I was young enough. I can see that you understand that it really has no boundaries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should Do you think of these words as a boast?" Roland raised an eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mental youth is not measured by good or bad, sire." The accident is that Kajin did not follow the common sense," Spiritual youth is accompanied by progress, fearlessness, curiosity, etc... It can motivate a person to move forward, and can also make people lose themselves, sometimes even ruining them, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, Kajin---!" Barov whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, sorry, I just said it casually," the master of the drama returned. "When you are older, you see more people. There will be some strange thoughts, please forgive me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem," Roland waved, and he felt a bit more impression on Kajin. Let's go back to business. I listened to Barov and said, "Would you like to take up the script I wrote, or join the Star Flower Troupe directly? Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;卡金The answer is very straightforward: "I want to know more about the shadow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that after being rejected by himself, I want to achieve the goal through this roundabout way. What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you perform some drama that you sneered at?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't look down on those dramas... ..." He explained, "I just think that a drama should be carefully prepared, and the actors can continue to improve. Otherwise, it will waste energy and talent, and live up to the expectations of the audience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
