			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, when she does not want to train, she will enter the deepest part of the labyrinth of the underground, go Take a look at the magic core of the high hopes of the Tacula survivors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the complete sacred instrument? Are you sure it is useful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest The core looks like a simple spindle, close to the high-level witch's experimental tower, and dozens of white brackets like magical ribs. The extraordinary is also obvious, there is no hanging object or support around it, but it can float in the air in the labyrinth hall. Under the faint glow of the core, the ground is not only a monotonous fire red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I have been studying it for 385 years!" A group of sarcomas drilled from the top of the hole and landed beside her with tentacles. "The more in-depth research, the more it feels that it belongs to the creation of the gods. By contrast, the sneak peeks of the gangs are not shit, the magic stone is printed? 啧啧 ...... simply the magic of the fur is not I feel that if we can make this ruin four hundred years ago, there may not be a second battle of gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One mentions the magic core Celine will become very excited. She has to pat the rough skin of the other side. "Have you verified the other cores?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, Shah even used the illusion instrument to show miracles in the mortal kingdom thousands of miles away - ah, you may still be sleeping at that time, so you have not seen this moment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Thousands of miles away?" she was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, far beyond the reach of any ability, the infinite mark is not worth mentioning in front of it," Celin waved the tentacle road. "This is the power of the magic core. It allows the witch to have the ability to limit itself. The mortal who is scared by the miracle is the best proof. It is the direction we should move forward. Instead of what a damn god fines! Long live Natalya!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there is no God penalty plan, we can't continue," she reminded One sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... well, Akaris is also a long lived," said Celine, reluctantly muttering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I listened to Pasha and said that it would take a day to start the sacred instrument, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the chosen person! This magic core is too large and complex. Without a heavenly person, it will always be a dead thing, not a new god!" Celine used tentacles Hook her hand, "So our hope falls on you, please be sure to find her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If she does exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this problem, the sarcoma’s voice instantly sinks down. “Yeah...if she does exist. Why can’t I be a good candidate?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the Star City was defeated! They were defeated by mortals!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the news came, the magma of the underground was boiling, and both the long-sleeper and the watcher excitedly waved the tentacles of the whole body - this is their only expression. heart The way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not everyone is excited about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible?" For example, Aer's dance style means shock and anger. "How can the guys lose to mortals?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the source reliable?" someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will commission the Chamber of Commerce to conduct an investigation," Pasha made a quiet gesture with the tentacles. "You stop, don't smash the hole!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s weird, they all look exactly the same, all of them are huge sarcoma shapes plus tentacles that are covered with skin, but she can easily tell who is who. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasha dropped a huge body and dipped it into the lava. "Take the tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the sarcomas that can still move down, the sounds are ringing," Jingtaqila."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surging magma calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the message is confirmed, I suggest to recycle God's legacy immediately," Elena said. "The Star City is not worth having it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that will inevitably conflict with God’s fines, and I don’t think they are unprepared for it - even if the Star City is defeated by the mortal hand, it does not mean Hermes was so badly wounded," said Elsie. "Who knows how mortals win? Perhaps it is just killing a hundred-person gods and punished them. It is a great victory." Maybe not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people agree with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Another group of mortals will help us understand," Pasha said. "But the most important thing now is to find the best. Barry. Lothar has set the stage and just waited for the actors to appear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the line can find the winner, the devil will be annihilated. The witch will surely usher in the most brilliant moment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She went to the exit Stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large hall, the dome of the half has been crushed by the earth, and there is a patio in the center of the temple, which leads directly to the surface of several tens of meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white light scatters down the patio, forming a soft beam of light that illuminates a square of land at her feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location facing the patio is two graves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no trace of dust on the tombstone, which is in stark contrast to the dilapidated ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, for centuries, people have been cleaning this place, and they have planted a circle of white flowers for the people in the tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bent down and kneeled on the grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the place where the greatest witches are buried, no matter how disagreements they had during their lifetime, how fierce disputes broke out, but ultimately they were for the witches. continue. And after they die, they are still close together and never separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation has three seats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The never-falling star, Queen Akalis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dazzling day-to-day Queen Nataya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May God be with you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the prayer, she stood up and gently nodded her head toward the dome. "I am ready, let me go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tentacles stick out from the shadows, roll up her waist and ascend to the patio. The sky of the palm-sized sky is getting bigger and bigger until it suddenly occupies her entire field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She licked her eyes and allowed herself to adapt to the change of glare and then slowly opened it. The long-lost ground world was fully presented to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can only send you here," Pasha's tentacles hovered in the hole. "This body can't see the sun."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," she bent down and said goodbye to the tentacles. "Wait for my good news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Right, you can't use the original name for the time being. The mortal chamber of commerce has arranged a new identity for you, and a nickname for identity--76."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
