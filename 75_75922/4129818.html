			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God, it’s really you!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwai took a bag of heavy golden dragons, and when he came down from the viewing platform, a very familiar voice came from his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and couldn’t help but raise her mouth, "Hey, tiger claw!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Ha ha ha, I haven't seen you for a long time, Kwai!" The big man hugged her and patted her back. "When I took your name, I thought it was the same celebrity. I didn't expect you to Winning the chief knight and dawn dawn, it really surprised me! Wait... This hand, are you fat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwai smiled and pushed him away, The response gave him a punch in his chest. "Go to yours, it’s normal than the skin except before. Is this normal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I It means that the fat point is good," the tiger's claw whistled. "At least it looks more like a woman." He looked at the sunflower up and down. "But really, your appearance has changed too much... ...I was not sure when I was on the stage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there?" She shrugged. "The hair grows longer and eats much more." It’s a bit. You don’t grow anymore. ? A lot of it "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" This is my practice every day to stay out of the site, "the latter proudly raised arms!. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurricane...snoring...Kwai, wait for me," Xiao struggled out of the crowd and panted. "Hey, this is not a tiger claw." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see, this guy has almost no change, still so small," Tiger Claw also gave him a warm hug, "Don't tell me You also ran all the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, cough...slightly," Xiao smiled. "I came over by the caravan owner's carriage. If I didn’t want to go with me, I didn’t want to go there.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you a businessman?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a mess." He embarrassedly touched the back of his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this guy not knowing a few words?" Kwai said, "The primary education class is also learning a little faster than others. After the assessment is passed, A Chamber of Commerce has taken a fancy and sat in the house every day to deal with the books. The days are too comfortable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out. Fortunately, you are coming, otherwise we How can it happen to be so close together?" The tiger claws laughed. "Go, let's go to the winter without a winter, and celebrate it for the sunflower!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"But yes, but..." Xiao looked around and looked at it. "Is it a snake tooth? Didn't he sign up for the competition?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenton felt A jump in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she had long wanted to ask this question, but it was not too eager to behave too much. At this time, she pretended to look at the tiger's claws as if nothing had happened. "It won't be that he is too far away from you, do you go back first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He...one ran to hide the forest to repair the railway. "The tiger's claws are lazy and replied. "Although the reward is good, I will send it out if I am not careful. What is the meaning of earning more? I used to live in the sewers. Now I have a house that is just right." Still not satisfied, I have to pursue a double room, I sometimes can't understand what he is thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that can provide a family A warm and comfortable place to live, rather than simply sheltering the wind and rain, the heart of the sunflower is sour and sour, "Of course, for the sake of white paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "White paper?" The tiger claws are inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you won’t forget even the white paper,” Xiao Xiao said, “She is our companion.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but what does this matter with her?" Tiger claws confuses, "White paper now joins the Witch Alliance, living in the castle area, does not need We provide the house. And the snake tooth guy is also, obviously seeing the white paper several times, but dare not go up to say hello, but also dragged me to hide aside, and now she does not know that we are here." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiger claw shook his head helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“噗——哈哈哈哈哈,” Kwai’s mouth laughed. “That’s a fool!” I don’t know why, she suddenly felt relieved. Many, even with their footsteps, are brisk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kwai Sister, whisper," Xiaoxiao said, "The people around are watching us."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Kwai did not take it seriously, but waved his hand toward the crowd, and exchanged a good laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have undoubtedly regarded her as a champion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so good..." The tiger claw exclaimed, "Two years ago, I couldn’t imagine that there would be such a day."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks to fame, the one hundred golden dragons are the focus," Xiao has a different opinion. "If you use it for business, the income is definitely higher than the work. Even if you don't know anything, you can find a business association to vote together. If you can grow up, you basically have to lie down and collect money-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I want to buy a house. "Kwai interrupted, "in the border area."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诶?" Xiao Xiaodao, "This is obviously a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! If you start from scratch, you know How long does it take for a hundred golden dragons to be picked up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, but I have already decided," Kwai did not hesitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about your work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I have to buy a bicycle, She said along the way. "You also saw how easy it is to ride. If there is a bicycle, it should be a day... No, I can rush back to the long song area from here in the morning. And there are also many The letter is passed on both sides. Maybe I can make more money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." I looked at her for a long time, and finally like surrender I sighed, "I’ll just let you, anyway, I have never convinced you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwai smiled, but the mind flew back two years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day of separation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four stood on the dock. She once asked the snake tooth, "Will you come back?", but I still couldn't get an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, she felt that she might never see each other again in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance between Bianyan Town and Changge Fortress is so far away, even if it merges into a city, in her eyes, it is also separated by the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know where they have been to the farthest place is just a junkyard outside Changge City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city of Bentham is a distant place in consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before being tempted by the bounty of the Games, Kwai was the first to embark on Kingdom Avenue. In order to cheer herself up, she also forcibly pulled it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the distance between the two places refreshed her imagination - compared to her own first place, Kwai was even more surprised that she and the snake The teeth are not so far away. There was neither a mountain road that wandered around, nor a paved road. A straight black stone road connected the two places. For the first time, she had the feeling of being a city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, why should she wait for the other party to come back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you haven’t been in the past? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like what King’s Majesty said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called "impossible" may be the shackles used to break - who knows if it will be another miracle before attempting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find a pub, I invite you to drink enough." The sunflower took a picture of the money bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
