			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Tilly left the office, Roland gave a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, it’s a very stressful thing to be nonsense in the face of a smart person, especially if you have to maintain a sincere and sincere expression. Fortunately, the report of the nightingale gave him a chance to breathe - the sleeping island witch had all returned to the castle, and Roland took the opportunity to end the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, in the face of your own witch sister, is there a special feeling?" The nightingale turned to sit on the table and looked down at the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter turned a blind eye and didn’t have a good air. "Is it a special feeling of stress?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I thought it was a touching reunion," she grinned.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My relationship with her is not good," Roland sighed. "When I was in the palace, I often bullied her. When I grew up, it was no different from a stranger. It was already a surprise for her to come here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? "She means profoundly. "You can't get along with other strange witches. I think you believe her." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's because I don't want you to see me lying, Roland didn't answer, refilling his teacup and leaning slowly on the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In short, you will understand later. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night reached out and touched his lips. "You will tell me everything, right?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... um. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This promise I accepted," she chuckled, then disappeared in front of Roland.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Roland leaned back on the back of the chair, recalling the entire conversation process, looking for possible leaks - this is the "best fit" explanation he can think of. The experience of many years of work tells him that the more lies he makes, the more he can't stand the scrutiny. Therefore, when he deliberately hides, accidentally finds ancient books, or the hermit teaches such a statement, as long as he continues to ask questions, it is difficult to justify himself. In addition to being their own sister, the other party is also the leader of the witch organization. Before the formation of stable allies on both sides, any lie that is exposed will bring a heavy blow to trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he chose to tell the truth about the details that might be exposed, and the extra knowledge was pushed to the sudden memory - although it sounds incredible, but contrast Even more incredible crossings, at least not too many negative effects, and can not be falsified. If it is the latter, can she accept a completely stranger from the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as they bite the identity of the four princes of the Grey Fort, no one can deny it. And what she wants, I am afraid, is just an explanation made by myself. Roland knows clearly that a good leader will not always be entangled in the past, and joining hands is the most important thing. This winter will allow her to see the broad prospects of the West, and the sincerity of her cooperation is a successful meeting. As for the relationship between them, there will be a lot of time to repair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, the castle hall held a grand banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common pepper steaks, omelettes and white bread are not mentioned, all kinds of white wine, fried bird and mushroom, dumplings and ice cream are all on the way. The taste has been upgraded to a new level, and the concept of fancy platter has been introduced on the plate. A large dish of sauce is filled with a small piece of sauce-filled staple food. The visual effect is excellent. The index finger is moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a staggered, cup-light candle, the dinner ended in a harmonious atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is the more formal talks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room, the fireplace burns, Roland and the Witch Alliance members sit in a row at the long table, and Tilly sits in a row opposite the Sleeping Island Witch. Due to the sensitivity of the identity, the wheat stubble is simply turned into a pigeon shape on the chandelier above the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tili took the lead and said: "I want to help Bianbu Town to resist the invasion of evil spirits, but also intend to pick up the five witches sent before. She told the recent situation of the sleeping island. "In the coming spring, Yinyuewan will move into the island to join a group of ordinary people. The extra housing and food needs to be solved by lotus and honey."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
