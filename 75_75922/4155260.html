			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waking up from the dream, Roland immediately called Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The detailed information on the floating land, I have basically understood. It is indeed the creation of the devil, and they are called "the god of God." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly couldn't help but see her from the moment she brought the news to now. Where did the intelligence come from?<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, I have some special channels," Roland naturally knows the doubts in the other's heart, but the fact that the monk is trapped in the dream world is too difficult to explain, he chose Straight out, "Information may be biased, so it can only be used as a reference, the actual situation has to rely on you to confirm. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then briefly told the origin of the god of God.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, Is that actually a floating city? "Tilly was surprised.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Roland nodded. "But it is much bigger than a city." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Wakiris, the combination of the obelisk that makes the red fog and the magic core can produce extremely amazing results - it does not Participating in the creation of the god of God, but also knowing the whole plan. In order to obtain stable core parameters, the devil has done many experiments, including the test of the city of Tabun a hundred years ago almost destroyed the entire city. The magic of the moment instantly tore the stratum, the buildings have risen from the ground, collapsed on the way up, countless bad devils were thrown into the air and then fell, turned into a beach mud.<br /><br />&nbsp In order to block the news, Wang eventually classified it as a magic accident. Despite the heavy losses, the plan not only did not stop, but accelerated the pace. In addition to the gradual approach of the war of the gods, the devil urgently needed to get rid of the red fog. The limitation is also a big reason. The disaster at least let the top executives see that the plan is not impossible to achieve.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of God is the last thing they get Results.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; magic deep underground for several kilometers, and then tens of kilometers of land together to support the stability of the foundation. From the sky overlooking, it is a floating land, and looking up from below, it is like a The mountain is wide and narrow, and it stands on the top of the dome. By adjusting the magic of the core instrument, the god of God can not only float up and down, but also travel in the sky like a boat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Because of this feature, the devil's top management also regards it as the only way to counterattack the heavens and the sea. Once they seize the human territory, they will be able to get another round of rest time, and there will undoubtedly be more gods. Ascended to the sky, with a large number of madmen directly to the sky and sea.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These information also made Roland realize that the progress of the other side in the four hundred years should not be underestimated. They and humans have embarked on a completely different technological path, but that does not mean that they are backwards.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic is undoubtedly a potential The power of the god can be seen from the plan of God's creation. Whether it is tearing the earth, throwing thousands of buildings into the air, or lifting a land, turning it into energy is an amazing number. Now the devil's experiment is more inclined to empirical theory, but quantitative changes often bring Qualitative change, once these experiences are transformed into systematic scientific theories, their strength will inevitably advance by leaps and bounds.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same for humans.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the war, it is very necessary to establish the Department of Magic Mechanics as soon as possible. Even if he doesn't know anything about magic, he can at least guide future generations to carry out research on this power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the essence of science. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything that exists is the object it observes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I don't know where your intelligence came from, it sounds like that." Tilly thought, "So, you." Have you come up with a way to deal with the god of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, this thing is hardly afraid of any artillery fire, the first army should save its own living power for Lord. Secondly, the empty knight will be the key to the next battle.” Roland slowly said, “The method of dealing with it cannot be said to be no, but whether it can be successful is still an unknown.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
