			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland completed his promise on a sunny afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a book of the ancients. Pine is the Viscount, the territory is divided south of the Chishui River, and the town across the river. It is still a jungle today and belongs to the area to be developed. In order to make him abandon the autonomy in the territory, Roland promised to give priority to the development of the territory of Tigu, and the industry established on the land, can be divided into certain shares for the Viscount and his descendants. Of course, Roland uses mouth gun skills to describe it as a good thing that neither manages the industry nor lays down money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tigu readily agrees with this - he didn't like it at all, and in his opinion, there is nothing more interesting than riding a horse. But now that she has a daughter, he puts his energy on hunting. In addition, the industry in the original territory of Tigu has long been declining. He simply asked the prince to send people to help him sell the land east of the fortress and move the whole family to live in the town. Roland naturally promised to come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person is Brian, who gave him the knighthood and asked him if he chose to land or serve in the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose land, you can no longer join the first army in Bianbu Town. If you join the army, you must be promoted to other people, and you will be rewarded with land for reward. Brian chose the latter without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, Roland also had a rough map of land use planning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Chishui River as the boundary, the land sandwiched by the desolate mountains is a residential area, with a narrow area of ​​about three kilometers and a wide area of ​​seven or eight kilometers. In the future, you can build a community, or you can use it as a reward land and reward it to a promotion officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the Chishui River, it is the future industrial zone and agricultural zone. The land can be extended to the south, but it is still a piece of wood, and it is still far away. There are undulating hills. When the population meets the demand, Roland must start to open the woodland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fascinating forest west of Bianbu Town is also an important development point. There are all kinds of treasures in the forest, such as wood, edible fungi, wild animals and herbs. In addition to being used in construction and industry, wood can also be used as a fuel. The forest is so large that Roland has let the light probe through it. It has not seen the end of the flight for 30 kilometers. It is all used as firewood and can be burned for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is the open space between the lost forest and the desolate mountains - also a restricted area where no one is involved, quite wild. According to the trend of the boundary line between the mountains and the forest, the area of ​​the middle folder is extremely broad, almost much larger than the gray kingdom. In the face of such a land of nowhere, Roland was itchy. But he also knows that he can't take care of this place for the time being. At present, the most needed for Bianbu Town is the population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the castle office, he recruited painter Soroya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the work done recently to assist the City Hall?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never I painted so many paintings a day," she looked more spiritual than when she first saw it. "It’s basically finished today. But it’s a bit strange to leave only a head-sized window when painting."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let your magic pen scare the townspeople," the prince smiled. "Although they know that there are witches, such close contact is still prone to accidents. So simply take some hidden means so that they don't know that you are a witch. It will slowly become better in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soloya's camera ability gives Roland citizens The registration plan has brought about a new upgrade. The City Hall vacated a room for the project as an archive to store information about the townspeople. Similar to the household account, each piece of paper is written with their name, age, residence, blood relationship and so on. This information Barov had a simple statistics in the winter, and this record has expanded a lot. The biggest change is that all the characters in the account are accompanied by "color photos." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the request of Roland, the City Hall set up a small room in the hall for single entry and exit, wrapped in linen, only left in front A square window for Soroya to see each other. When the witch paints a portrait in the house, the other party will not see the magical magic pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how to let the residents of the territory come forward to declare information, Roland’s method is very simple, and the recipients can get ten copper eagle subsidies. The money is paid by the City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
