			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland although the first army was tweeted twice a week, but never tried to march at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a dangerous thing to dispatch troops at night. It’s easy to be seen by the beasts and vipers, and it’s easy to get lost. Lifting the torch is a natural target. Therefore, he had to wait until the next day to let the team start, and follow the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure the smooth operation of this operation, the prince decided to follow the first army. Of course, he chose to ride the township number compared to the horseback riding and the buttocks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hummingbird has been able to control the light weight of the 12-pound gun within a fixed range after half a month of training, considering the longer enchantment process, Roland Arrange for her to transform the artillery at dawn, so that the first door lasts for the longest time, and the remaining doors are successively decremented to ensure that the four-door light-weight failure time is as equal as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to the ability of the hummingbird, the township can now carry four artillery pieces and members of the artillery team at one time. The huge cement boat is full of people - in addition to the artillery team and Roland, the town number is Anna, nightingale, Nana, leaves, echo, hummingbird and Tigu. Pine, Wendy is responsible for providing power. The steering man is Brian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that in addition to the books that are not good at fighting, Soroya, Lily and Mystery, the witches in Bianque Town almost come out. Originally, Anna didn't need to go to the battlefield, but her firm eyes made Roland finally unable to get down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The land force was the first army's firearms army, led by the chief knight Carter and the iron axe, lightning took on the whole process of positioning and tracking. A group of people quietly followed the enemy, just outside the range of the patrol. Once the lightning finds that there is a detective ride, the army will stop moving forward. Along the way, they also captured a large number of scattered mercenaries and freemen, but at this moment there is no way to deal with these surrendering enemies. After disarming, they are taken care of by the players who have not been assigned to the muskets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the first time that Roland has led the "big army" to conquer the enemy. He stood at the bow of the town and felt the morning breeze blowing in the face. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you laughing at?" Anna suddenly appeared beside him, looking up and asking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Roland instantly put away a smile, "Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? "She handed a handkerchief, "scratch the saliva."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Roland suddenly felt the urge to jump into the water, "Thank you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lightning reports to the other party, it is already the setting sun. Compared with the uninterrupted investigation, it is clear that after a great defeat, the morale of the coalition has dropped to freezing point. Just after dusk, the knight who was investigating could not wait to rush back to the camp, for fear of missing the horse meat at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s troops are stationed on the shore two kilometers from the Duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no discovery along the way, and the annihilation plan was already halfway through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, just wait until the day is light, and you can complete the encirclement when the enemy has not yet started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the first time Roland spent the night in the wild. He is more inclined to sleep on the boat than the camps where the reptiles are rampant. The wooden shed where the guns were parked was emptied, and the members of the gun group unloaded 12 pounds of guns into the camp. The township became the temporary palace of the prince. In addition to Roland, other witches stayed on board for the night. Everyone will be covered with a shed and lie down side by side with the shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland wanted to hold on and found that the witches were more concerned than him. Except for Anna, they all suffered a lot of suffering, and they were displaced. In the days, sleeping in the wild is a commonplace. In a short while, everyone went to sleep, and only Roland and Anna could not sleep. The former used to have a soft bed, which was difficult to adapt to the hard deck bed, while the latter did not know what to think, and kept looking at Roland sideways. When the prince turned his head, Anna always closed her eyes and pretended to be asleep, but in the moonlight, she could still see her eyelashes shaking slightly. If it wasn't for the other people, Roland really wanted to pinch the other's tiny nose, forcing her to open her eyes and hold her back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the two stayed up almost overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
