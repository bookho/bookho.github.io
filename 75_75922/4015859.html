			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The welcome banquet was arranged after dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eldest son of Dawn. Moya’s eldest son received them warmly in the palace hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy is still in contact for the first time a dinner of such a high standard - the entire hall is lit up by candlelights and oil lamps, and the position of the chandelier hanging from the dome of the hall They all have open skylights, and countless fires are like stars, but they don't give people a feeling of sultry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long white table with a stepped white cloth is filled with a variety of glassware. The bright red wine reflects the ruby-like reflection in the candlelight. Glossy, and silver mirrors and gold wares are everywhere in the hall, reflecting the grandeur of the entire hall, which is as luxurious as the Grey House. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the most attractive thing to pay attention to is the aristocratic women who walked between men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are young and childish, and some are mature and rich. Whether you put your hair up or on your shoulders, you can see the same color as the original hair color." The satin is like a decorative object buried in the hair. Reminiscent of Denise's appearance, it seems that this is also the popular style of the morning nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, most of them wear a close-fitting satin, flowing when they walk, the perfect curve of the body. And unlike the popular robes of the Grey Fort, most of these clothes stop on the knees, and the shoulders are exposed, which is like deliberately tempting him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Joel’s heart cheered and his choice was correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the woman of the Grey Fortress is also concerned about some subtle and restrained sentiment, then this is an unobtrusive fiery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, most of their enthusiasm is for those handsome guys and knights, not for nobles like him who are not outstanding enough, but this is hard to beat. Hey, he has never been attractive by appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the dawn kingdom," a young, pale-skinned man walked to him in front of him, "Roland. I have already read the introduction letter and the instrument. So, is he now getting the entire gray fort?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that this person must be the owner of the dinner. , His Royal Highness, Anpein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy is busy with the chest, because he represents the gray castle royal family, so there is no need to kneel down. At the same time he bowed his head, he was also secretly surprised. If the banquet was hosted by the eldest son, it can be said that the king’s government was busy, and he couldn’t get out of it. Even the letters of Roland’s majesty were directly ignored by the eldest son. Point can even be regarded as a diplomatic loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first answered the other’s question, then asked hard, “I don’t know your father...”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is ill, he is very ill," Anpein sighed. "This is why he can't personally entertain you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Very, I am sorry to hear this news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing... This is already known to the Glow City. One and a half months Before, he suddenly fainted at the banquet, and he never recovered. He could only stay awake for two or three hours every day, and he was still asleep during the rest of the day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Half a month ago... It was almost exactly the day when I set off from the Grey Kings. I was comforted. "He will slowly get better, please don't worry too much."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," the prince smiled. "Let's enjoy this party, then I will let the ceremonial officer prepare you for a place to stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;& Nbsp; "Thank you for your care," when the other party was about to leave, Joel suddenly remembered his business, and quickly said, "Yes, my dear Sir, I don't know the alliance between the former Dawn Kingdom and the Grey Fort -" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know something about this, but now my father is temporarily unable to handle government affairs, or wait until he is better."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that I am quite talented as an ambassador. For the first time, I have not made any mistakes with the royal high-level officials. Unfortunately, I encountered a small accident on the primary task. However, this does not matter. Anyway, he will live in the city for a long time. It is impossible for Moya IV to continue to be sick for several years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this time, I still pay more attention to the beautiful women in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We met again, Mr. Ambassador," thinking, his familiar voice suddenly came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu was shocked and turned around and found that the person was really Denise Payton, the businessman who had been happy with himself. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come you--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, we will see you soon She smiled and raised a glass of red wine. "Come - for our reunion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jorda rushed to look around, for fear of having a certain The nobility is squatting here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you looking for my husband?" Dennis raised his eyebrows. "Reassure, he is not qualified to come here."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the owner of the Peyton family, not him," the other party Concealed and bluntly, "The maid at home is enough for him to enjoy. If you think of something fresh outside, you can't do it without my approval."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case ......About the hanging heart fell back. It seems that Denise is the heir to the Peyton family. The woman’s practice of continuing the family is usually to recruit some of the fallen aristocrats into the government as a companion. The name changed is naturally the man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should tell me earlier," he pretended to be relieved. "I don't want to destroy a pair of pure love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Dennis said, "When you reach out to me, you can't be pure." She paused. "After the dinner, you still Are there other arrangements?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I think it shouldn't be there," Joel took her waist, "If you invite me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I know there is a good place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everything is for you, Dear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the banquet, Otto pulled the big prince aside. "I don't understand, Your Highness, even if Moya is sick, you can also take the covenant first. Why should you put this on hold? The alliance with the Grey Fort is the meaning of your father. The church is so aggressive, we should not fight alone. Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that my father asked you to look for Tiefko. Wimbledon instead of Roland Wimbledon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our alliance should be the king of the Grey Fort. The news brought by the ambassador also proves this, and Roland is the new king of the neighboring country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anpein. Moya nodded. "The visit to the Grey Fort is hard for you, but I have my own plans for the alliance. You don't have to take it anymore."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't understand," Anpein interrupted. "I am for the morning." The kingdom is thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is for the safety of the kingdom that we need someone to contain the attack of the church!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, don't worry about this again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anpein’s voice could not help but rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am rude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
