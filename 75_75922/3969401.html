			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stood on the roof at the top of the bridge command room, looking at the back row The long fleet of one-word type is very embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although apart from the flagship Roland, the rest of the ships are slow and clumsy cement boats, but when more than a dozen ships together, it still looks spectacular. The white smoke rising from the chimney has grown into a long line. The river is also swaying from both sides because of this huge fleet. It feels the ups and downs of the first wave of the ship, and it has quite a momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the flagship gunboat is the most dazzling star in the queue - the towering bridge and slender shape make it completely different from ordinary sailboats and cement boats The weaponry includes a 125mm main gun at the front of the hull and two Mark 1 machine guns at the rear. The special high-pressure steam engine and propeller drive system allow it to run at a speed of 12 kilometers. In this era, it is definitely a river. The overlord of the basin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to be in a good mood," the night smashed the wind and the head of the wind, "because you can return to the place soon?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wanggong? No, I will never go back," he shook his head with a smile. "Westland is my home, I just feel that I can quickly quell the dispute." "Happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm... half is a lie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but He almost forgot that the other person could discern the lie. "Cough, well, I actually feel that I am very satisfied with the so many ships in an evil month."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time is true," said the night, "but it sounds a bit boastful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I don't want to Tell the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand," she chuckled twice and walked to Roland. "In fact, I didn't blame you, if not with My words, you . Operators sprinkle a little nervous, I would not mind "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" ...... "Roland secretly Fu Fei Road, do not mind if you do not specifically point out ah. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I haven’t said thank you yet." The night owl whispered to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"End the dispute, calm the gray fort, whether it is ordinary people or The witch can live happily under your rule," she said slowly. "I know you will do it, but I didn't expect that day will come so soon."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not so fast, even if Tiffel is overthrown, the nobility will also have a counterattack and dying struggle, and it will take several years to fully integrate the Grey Fort." Roland spit out, "after all, history Going forward in the spiral, there is still a long way to go to achieve the ultimate goal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s far beyond my imagination, I was still Worried about seeing this scene with your own eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What a stupid thing," he glanced at the other person. "Do you think I will let you go?" "There is no danger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am a fighting witch, it is a matter of course to be active in the front line, and I want If you break the existing rules, you have to pay some price," Nightingale turned his head. "I prepared this from the moment I swear allegiance to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Unfortunately, let you down," Roland shrugged. "The price will certainly be there, but it is basically paid by the enemy. Besides, I have to thank you for this."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" she said differently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I have not met the witch, I will not be so determined to get out of this step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If it is not Anna, he will not immediately make a decision to save the witch. If the world has no magical power, he is afraid to stay in the barren border town, and to live a primitive and simple life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
