			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back home, Camo Spoel saw it at a glance A black envelope on the dining table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" He looked to Serra, the busy wife in the kitchen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, yes, the afternoon town hall official came," the wife wiped the grease on her hand and put a savory broth on the end. The dining table, "said that His Royal Highness is going to let you go to the king, the ship responsible for the pick-up will arrive two days later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was not looking for his brother there. Trouble, let me do something, it’s a waste of time,” Camo frowned. “It’s not a week since I couldn’t reach it. His request is getting more and more excessive.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is your prince, your lord of the winter city, dear," Serra smiled and shook her head. "And the city hall official said that in order to show the importance, he also gave You have written a letter. This is already a rare honor. After reading it, remember to keep this letter in good condition. Later, you may be able to pass it on as a heirloom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;What heirloom, if it is the full version of "Medium Chemistry" is still almost the same, Kaimo grin, "First Dinner, eating say ...... he better have a good reason "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; After a simple dinner, he got into the den, open the envelope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small note that fell out and was almost one finger long. Obviously this is a secret letter passed by the pigeons, and the outside cover is added after the town hall officials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemo held the note with one hand and groped for a moment on the table, pinching the monocle on the bridge of the nose. Reading for a long time under the dim light of the candle makes his vision less than a day. Fortunately, the life in the town has been greatly improved. Five or six candles can be lit in the room at the same time, but I don’t know when it will be bright at home. It is as bright and clean as a chemical factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content on the note is short, only one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember the Wangdu Alchemists Association? Now you have the opportunity to tell them what is real alchemy."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kemo breathed a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wangdu Alchemy Association is the place where all those who are determined to embark on this path and pursue the truth of all things are most eager to go. Of course, he is no exception when he was young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the wife knows that he has submitted an application to the Wangdu Alchemy Association - using his alchemy formula "Solution Liquid" As a stepping stone. However, during the review process, Kaimo’s formula failed unexpectedly. He could not get the brown-yellow acid that smoked after two trials. At the time, the alchemist who was attending the review, Wrighten, was furious and said that he was deliberate. To waste the valuable raw materials of the association, not only did not give him the opportunity to try the third time, but also ordered the guard to snatch his purse and blast him out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the entrance of the association, Lightening sneered and took five silver wolves out of the bag and left it in front of Kaimo, saying that it was the toll for him to roll back to Chishui City. The rest is the compensation association's loss. After that, he turned and left, leaving Kemo with a back and a great shame. This incident became a scar in his heart, except for his wife, who did not disclose it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a stomach back to Chishui City, Kaimo did not give up alchemy, he spent the whole day in the workshop, trying to find a new alchemy formula And they proved to the Wangdu Alchemy Association that their vision and level are just like this... I didn’t expect this to be ten years. Until the age of thirty, he found a second alchemy formula and was promoted to an alchemist in Chishuicheng. . And if you really become the chief, it will be another six years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this period, Camo regarded the Wangdu Alchemy Association as the biggest rival and had several industry exchanges with it. But the performance of the other side is like a proud swan. They don't even agree with any alchemist organization except them. They think that the alchemist in Chishuicheng is just an apprentice level. At best, it is a disciple, and it is not worthy of this title. Most of the so-called newly discovered alchemy formulas are old things that the association has figured out in more than a decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the association’s chief also dismissed that there was no need to build an alchemy workshop in other cities. This skill required a lot of money and manpower, and it was not the general lord who could play. Affordable. If there is a need for alchemy, you can directly ask for them. If the lord himself invests, it may be that tens of thousands of golden dragons will fall down, and they will not be able to splash a splash of water. Ten can only produce a pile of waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
