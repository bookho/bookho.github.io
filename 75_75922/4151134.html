			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the West Line program goes well, life should have crossed the edge of the mainland and infiltrated into the human domain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the birth tower in the Great Rift Valley is no longer a secret, even if the opponent is slow, it should be reflected. Why is Hekzod still indifferent? Is human being too weak, can it be dealt with by one person? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakirith felt that it was impossible to think about it. If the other side weakened to this extent, Erskuk would not be defeated in the fertile plains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear to the heart that too long isolation has caused it to lose its ability to judge the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience makes the nightmare feel great uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a human...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks to the other end of the platform, only to see Roland Accompanied by two females, watching the game with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn! Does he have no business to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he has a way out of here, then maybe his only chance - the inheritance and knowledge of mankind is undoubtedly brought out of the world by him, he There must be some kind of communication channel with the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the other person leaves the conscious world, he has the opportunity to capture that opportunity. After all, in the king’s ruler, it has repeatedly perceived the king. Contact with the field. It is precisely because of this ability that it dares to follow the fluctuations of the fragments and go to the depths of the consciousness to find the traces of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the other party has been active in this world, and it has not given it any chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the king of mankind be able to idle to this point and ignore politics for a few months? It is better to waste time on the meaningless martial arts conference, and not to read a few more books. The only explanation is that the pressure on the front line is too little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is still Heckzod’s fault! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ups and downs, Wakiris suddenly noticed that Roland had left the two and walked alone to a corner. And there was a hooded female standing there, as if she was deliberately waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It came out of the crowd with a careless look, but his eyes were always on Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they simply talked a few words, the female pointed to the direction of the exit. Roland seemed to hesitate, but eventually nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to the association? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris has planned to do so, but somehow, it always feels that the female has a familiar atmosphere. It was this strange feeling that made it take a few more steps and glanced at a closer position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what makes Wakiris’s cold hair stand up – in dim light, it sees a similar West The face of Talis, or the "岚" of the martial arts association! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it difficult to be hidden in this world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland can enter and leave this place as a human male, also because of it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news is too amazing, and Wakiris can no longer follow the impulse to hold his heart, and quickly follow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland and the suspected Thousands of People did not walk outside the martial arts hall after passing through the safe passage, but turned into the underground garage, and the nightmare was as light as possible. Far behind the two, until they entered a human defense refuge channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wakiris followed the past, he found that the passage was only ten meters long, there was no ramp inside, and at the end was a closed cement wall. There is also a warning sign "Not yet completed, no entry". It is clearly a dead end, but the two are missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vakiris reacted instantly, but it was too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After it turned and rushed back, Roland had appeared behind it, blocking the only path. And there are several females standing beside him - seeing the different ways of using the martial arts, Wakiris has no luck in the last trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that all the women standing next to him are witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It finally understands where the familiar familiarity comes from, and that is the nuance between magical fluctuations and natural forces. If the witch can also come to this area of ​​consciousness and have the power of the original, then its exposure is only a matter of morning and evening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the other person can quietly hide so many people to set up, sneaking into it for monitoring is just a breeze - this is just a little Think about it. All its disguise is aimed at the contact on the bright side, and the witch with different ability is just a joke. I am afraid that in the past four months, its path has long been touched by the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We met again, Miss Wakiris," said Roland calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris has no openings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, anything is said to be self-deprecating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it always wonders why the other party can let the witch come to this field, it is no longer important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party deliberately set aside in this secluded place, the purpose of which is self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing it can do now is to die in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightmare of the monarch agitates the magic of the whole body, and the body leans forward slightly. As for the magic stone ability and the magical technique, there are several in front of a group of fighting witches. The odds are not at all considered. In any case, it is impossible to surrender to the enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I ask you to drink coffee from the Kajid Peninsula?" Roland said again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"-" Wakiris has almost stepped out of the steps, it is stuck in place, the upper body is still tilted, it seems to stop It is quite blunt. "You - what to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please drink coffee." Roland repeated it again, "though that doesn't count as real coffee, but some A similar special drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris stunned him for a long time before he spoke out his doubts, "...why?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to guess what the male is thinking about - reality is different from here. The coexistence of ethnic groups and human beings is nothing but an illusion of illusion, since the other party has confirmed its true origin. It should be impossible to let go of yourself. If you are not greeted by death, then it will only be worse than death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because some things are spread out, it’s better than squatting." Roland slowly said, "especially in the case of a battle of divine war is not the ultimate battle." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Battle of God...not the ultimate battle...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiri Can't help but see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It did not expect to hear this from a human mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long silence, it returned to the alert position. "Where do you want to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Not far from here, it will arrive in a few minutes." Roland snapped his finger and the engine sounded from the back of the car. "Get on the bus, I have already booked a seat."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party did not deceive it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selected location is a high-end restaurant in a building, sitting in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows, you can see the silver-clad city skyline, floating in the hall With soft music, the atmosphere is elegant and serene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
