			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reaching this conclusion, Roland was relieved a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the underlying combat power, the devil does not surpass the operational effectiveness of conventional hot weapons. At a distance of 500 to a kilometer, machine guns and artillery are enough to smash everything. The enemy is attacked, and the spear attack is obviously not suitable for the war. It takes three to five seconds from the magic stone to take effect. As long as the bullet capacity keeps up, the madman won't even have the chance to throw a spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that at least on the frontal battlefield where the two armies meet, human beings absolutely have the power to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you were born in Takira, how good," Aegusa looked at the arms of Roland and exclaimed, "The average person in the fertile plains is more than gray." The castle is a hundred times, and so is the witch. If everyone has a long gun in their hands, perhaps the devil has already rolled back to where they came."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland laughs Laughter, but I don’t think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, more than 400 years ago was the witch-led empire, assuming that there is a weapon that allows mortals to have the power to transcend witches, and the high-level federation will readily accept it. presence? In any era, witches are a minority - from the glory of the road to the fertile plains, there are thousands of humans, but thousands of witches, and those who have been oppressed for a long time will be willing to embark on the battlefield. ? Once the power is reversed, the disintegration of the ruling class will inevitably lead to civil strife, and the idea of ​​fighting for human survival will be extremely vague even after the awakening of nationalism, not to mention that a group of people who live a slavery can possess such lofty Ideal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, these words will not be spoken in public. Ai Gesha is only a researcher at the Quest Society, and it is better not to let her involve political affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the injury test, Anna cut off the devil's limbs again and put it in the iron cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so good?" Ai Gesha asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head. "Today, come here first, and try the trauma test tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Testing the resistance of the devil's parts to the shooting, as well as the effects of chemical drugs, madness pills and dream water," he indulged Dao, "Yes, the composition of the red mist also makes Lucia try to separate and see what can be obtained."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the devil cannot be kept for a long time, otherwise there is Nana's healing ability, only a small amount of devil samples can get more comprehensive data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha yawned, "As you like, but I need two witch assistants to make the seal, and the materials must be prepared in advance. Once the devil dies, the blood won't last long, so it's best to start dissolving the stone of punishment when it is still alive." She paused. "Right, what kind of imprint do you want to make?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as the magic stone is enough, can any one be made?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, She nodded. "Failure doesn't consume the stone itself. It makes me at most... No, nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland raises his eyebrows, "What do you want?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not care, just a mistake," Ai Gesha grinned. "At most, you lose some ordinary materials."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the other party does not want to talk any more, he did not continue to ask, "Let me study the "Magic Stones" first, and tell you the answer tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbs p;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight is destined to be a sleepless night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis Kant stood by the window and looked at the city in the night – merchants often said that candlelight means wealth, the brighter the place after night The richer you are. She thought that the brightly lit scene would only be seen at the pub or theater in the inner city of Wangdu, but here she knew what it was called Changming Changming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
