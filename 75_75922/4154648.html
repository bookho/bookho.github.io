			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" Nigan was impatient. "Blood smell, do you think you are a dog?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this guy doing in the end, what is not like a normal spirit - with a little lightness and jokes in the tone, the average person will talk to the stranger who met for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s normal, he’s still interested in playing with each other, but getting out of Shenchi Bay is a priority. The best way to deal with a fool is to let her go thoroughly. To shut up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neggen increased the strength of his wrist to convey his thoughts to his elder brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter has not been released yet. "I think... you probably got it wrong. It used to be a harbour, killing fish and drying fish is not a rare thing." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The difference between human blood and fishy taste is probably as big as the difference between heaven and earth." The woman is not moving, "if only A smell can also be explained by a wound, but the bloody smell on your body is too much and too complicated, making it difficult to ignore. Some are very old, probably a few months apart, while others are very new, at most Two or three days ago - they are now coming out of your clothes, and they are constantly coming out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the clothes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigan couldn’t help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most knights, a light and strong armor is definitely the most valuable asset. Careful maintenance can often be passed down for generations. The Murray family also This is the case. They gave up the desolate land of the winter, but did not leave their armor and weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to be noticed, the two men covered their large coats and robes on the outside, but it was not unusual in winter to wear thicker. They won't be able to go into the air until they are murdered. In addition to being more flexible, don't worry about the blood from smudging the clothes. After a little wiping, you can restore the armor and clean the oil. Play a role in conservation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this should be something that no one can find, how could the other party know? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it... she really smells on her nose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigan’s heart burst into uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, holding his hand suddenly released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only saw the eyes swaying, Talos’s figure had already rushed to the woman - the elder brother did not pull out the weapon, for the well-trained person, The fist and joints can cause death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of this attack is completely fast. If you switch from your own to the shot, you may not be able to react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single ability and skill, the long brother is definitely the knight who is ranked first in the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the other person is a fool, a madman or a real smell is different from ordinary people, now it is already a dead person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the sound of the throat was not shattered, he only heard the two whispers of "Peng". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman raised her elbow and flew the iron arm that grabbed her throat, and then took the left fist of Talos with a single palm -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neggen’s eyes almost come out of the box! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the skill of killing, the difference in strength between men and women is enough to decide everything, not to mention the older brother’s strength and strength, being single-handed The first move is to see the move! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the two played against each other several times, but Talos never failed to kill his opponent. When he separated again, he finally tore off his robes and pulled out the short sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother, together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niegen realized that the brother of the knight had made the judgment that he could not take the other person with the power of one person at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" He pulled his teeth out of his dagger and bent over the side of Talos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who is not important to me, what matters is that you don't seem to be ordinary escapers - then it is necessary to explain the reasons for your lying." "The woman spread her hands, as if she said that she had no problem with empty hands. "If you surrender now, you may still suffer less. But killing is a felony. According to the law of the Grey Castle, once you confirm that the blood on you comes from innocent people, the ending In any case, there is only one dead end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy... crazy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to be persuading, but every action and every sentence is pushing them into a dead end - which has a dead end in front of the opening Sincerely said? Since you know that you will die, no one can handle it. In other words, the other party is pushing them to do it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More to say no benefit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Talos slashed his dagger forward, Nigan also followed, pressing the woman’s shelter from the side, and also preventing her from turning around. Run away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the other party seems to have no plans to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only did she not even try to cry out loud, but she struggled with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only after personal experience, Niegen knew how terrible the other party was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She’s every shot is so strong that she needs almost all her strength to fight, even the seemingly light weight block must be firmly gripped. Close to the first handle, otherwise it is easy to be smashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t imagine how the other’s body might have such amazing power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't hide your hand, she doesn't pose a threat to us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower's low He made a slamming back from the shock. Yes, they are wearing armor, and there is no sharp edge in the other hand. Even if you eat a fist or two, it’s no big deal, and it’s no harm to them by hurting and hurting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He threw a dagger at the woman, was easily flashed, opened his arms and flew directly to the target-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly a self-seeking death in the normal situation, but now how can she resist herself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sharp pain bursting on Nigan's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt his nose fall into the bones, the rust in his throat, and the line of sight suddenly became blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, really hurt...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you are finished! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He clenched his teeth and tried his best to close his arms. This range is far greater than the short sword and the dagger. If you want to avoid it, you have to destroy the existing defensive posture, and you will definitely see the flaws during the period! He believes that his brother will definitely seize this opportunity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, because the action of avoidance was too large, the whole body of the woman fell down, apparently unable to stop the next invasion of the eldest brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taros stepped forward, picking up the sword, and a gray light slanted into the woman’s head - the latter’s head lifted up, like this The snake smothered a blow with a blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no time to relax, the woman who leans back first does not scream like the expected, or directly slams her face to the ground, but borrows With the strength of the body, he kicked two feet in a row and flew him and Taros out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigan even felt that it was not a kick, but a siege hammer! With a loud bang, he slammed into the four-wheeled vehicle behind him. The armor on his body could not offset the front and rear pinch. The force that was introduced into the body made him wow and vomit blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
