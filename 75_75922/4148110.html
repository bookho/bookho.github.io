			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called "potion" does not have to be a pill to take effect. She has never told the nobles that their magic can be attached to any object - swallowing Small pills are easy to control, but they also ignore the crucial point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that private banquet, Dylan showed his ability to all food and drink, and only in this ridiculous occasion, the nobles will guard against her. drop to lowest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that when the pleasure accumulates to a high enough level, it can cause death as much as pain. It was too late when the participants realized that the pleasure was too strong. They licked their chests one by one, twitching and falling down, even if they didn't eat much, they all had soft hands and feet, and they looked like they were enjoying the ultimate happiness in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female slaves in the house were frightened and fled, and the guards could not stop, Dylan and Momo also ran out of the manor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the road to exile in Tibet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the news of the Great Migration of the Grey Fort, the two talents decided to go to Shenchi Bay to try their luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be the case..." Wendy reached out and took them into her arms. "Are you suffering a lot from this road? I promise, These things will not happen again in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...do you not give up on us?" Dailan bit his lip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should you dislike? Because of the past experience?" Wendy whispered. "If I say this, I was almost treated like this by the church. No. Any reason to blame the victim in this matter, not the perpetrator."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But our ability...will only bring misfortune to people." Lancome tightened his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not what you have to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But once you experience that kind of happiness After that, I will never forget that the requirements will only get higher and higher. In the end, apart from pursuing pleasure, nothing will be taken care of... If I stay here, I am afraid..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Afraid of the King’s sire can’t control, or regard you as a potential demon?” Wendy said comfortably. “Reassure, our sire... How to say, though not quite like a king, but It’s definitely an unusually good person.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dai Lan lived, “unusual...good guy?” She still heard the royal family use this for the first time. Words to describe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meaning is that you can never guess his thoughts, nor can you use routines to judge his actions. So any prior fears and fears are meaningless. Trust is the most important thing.” Wendy’s voice suddenly became very soft, “the sisters of the co-help club were also rescued.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silence moment Later, she looked at Momo. "Yes, you just said "you" ability, is it Momo too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the two hesitated For a longer time, Momo took the initiative to open the door. "Before the former owner didn't want me to use the ability again, I dug up the alienated eyes after I woke up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter has noticed this strangely. On Momo's face, a dirty rag slanted around the half of the forehead. She thought it was to cover scars such as burns or tattoos, and I didn't expect the results to be more serious than this.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party said slowly to remove the head. The rags reveal the hollow eyes below.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they don't know, it only makes me lose half of my vision, only the lock of the gods Can really block it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter can't help but sigh, the witch who can make the magic and body fully integrated, is called the extraordinary. And Momo's situation is obviously extraordinary. Irrelevant, in all likelihood, the ability happens to act on the "visual", causing the eyes to be innocent.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nobles did not put Momo's ability at the beginning. Put it in my heart, until some accidents happened later, let the master put her hand on her. Dylan whispered. "They called Momo the son of hell and used all kinds of punishments on her. She almost couldn't survive." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
