			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the heart of the snake tooth sinks to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let-open--" fear pinched his throat, and he opened his mouth, but his voice was very raw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to let go of her? Well," one person took off the stool at the foot of the sunflower, and her body immediately tightened. The ropes plunged into the neck of the sunflower, her feet twitched, and the tied hands clenched and loosened, but all struggles did not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tiger's claws rushed up, and the result was slammed on the back of the head with a stick, and the whole person suddenly fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it wasn’t for waiting for you to come back, she died early," Kanash’s crone sneered. "What a good excuse, diarrhea? You probably don't know the boss." Deliberately arranged for the man to stare at you, he knows that you are a group of stray dogs difficult to discipline, do not give a look at the color really think that the blood hand to help a little rule."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was wrong," said the snake, "Please let her go! She has not stepped out of this room!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But this little nephew lied to me," the other shrugged. "She still insisted that you are looking for shelter from the wind. If you don't recognize the two teeth, what is the use of this person? Give the opportunity to you." Retaliation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants his own life, the snake tooth realizes. He looked up hard, and the struggle of the sunflower had gradually weakened and the body began to pick up. He forced himself to look away and put his attention on the short sword at the waist of the confidant... There is only five or six steps between the two, and if you can rush to grab the sword -<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the rope is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kwai fell without a hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the hell--" The confidant frowned, but the words were not finished yet, a blood line was ejected from the side of the neck, and the nearest mouse was sprayed. A face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake's teeth looked at the scene in front of him with a stunned look. What happened in the brain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, there was a fight outside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! Here is the site of the blood hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is...someone Come in!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, my hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn, Give me out to do her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet, monster! Help..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nash's men glanced at each other and pulled out their weapons. However, they had not rushed out of the house. A half-corpse body flew in from the gate and directly knocked over the two guys standing in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the snake tooth saw the true body of the attacker - it was a woman with a handsome appearance, the black pony tail was randomly behind her, wrapped in her body Under the black robe, the eyes are a rare golden color. Just sweeping one's own eyes makes him feel that the blood is almost frozen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now let go of the weapon, hold your head and kneel down, you still have a way to live." The woman stretched out three fingers. "I counted three times and did not follow suit." People, die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene is only quiet for the time Soon someone shouted, "God, this kind of goods...absolutely worth one hundred golden dragons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is together!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Catch her, the boss must be rewarded!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take off her hand "To be alive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget it, you are still dead," she raised a fancy sword with a strange size and strange shape. Rush toward the crowd. Snake teeth can hardly believe their eyes. The sword was actually cast from iron. No matter what weapon, it would break on the top. Even the lime powder and the dark cockroaches have lost their effect. Her speed is as fast as a whirlwind. These very effective hidden weapons in the past can't hit the target at all. A group of people don't say resistance, and even escape from her hands can't. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swallowed his mouth and hurriedly climbed to the side of the sunflower, gently placing his hand on her nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmth of the breath slowly flows out...She is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth only felt a sore nose, and the rest of his life felt that he could no longer restrain his emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement is true! These people are sent by the prince of the prince to the organizers of the Qing gang! They are all able to survive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squatted on the sunflower and burst into tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more soldiers wearing brown uniforms rushing into the house, the battle is very It’s almost over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the still alive mice were ordered to stand in a row and walked out of the house door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...the head hurts a lot," the tiger claws groaned and groaned. "It’s so swollen."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not good to be killed by a stick," Snakes glanced at him. Until now, tears still left in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Kwai took a look at his neck, and the blue marks on the top were clearly visible. "I thought I was dead." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go out and tell you," Snakes shook his head. He is afraid of what he is saying now, and he will cry again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, it’s up to you." The guard at the door twisted his arm behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth did not resist, followed the other side out of the gate, and saw a white robe woman standing outside the yard, it was like the other one who killed the god in black. One side is normal. Her face was shrouded under the hood and she could only see a pair of golden curls hanging down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After answering the question of this adult, you can go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes "The snake teeth honestly responded, and the strength demonstrated by this group of people completely shocked him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you killed someone?" Her voice is crisp and sweet, like from another world, "Rape? Robbery?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stunned, the other is the invisible person who reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," she nodded. "Go to the square, etc. Let's give dinner to His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth stopped after two steps and asked for courage. "Are you... a witch?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." I thought I wouldn't get an answer. I didn't expect the other party to make a positive decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, these people are just Kanash’s men," he bit his lip and said in a breath. "He hasn’t returned here for four days, it must be And the blood hand is hiding! The blood hand is the real leader of this place, you must not let him go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, they can't escape." The other party smiled lightly, and the tone was full of unquestionable confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean...the prince’s Highness sent to hunt the mouse leader Is it a witch?" The tiger's claws widened their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not only witches, but also many ordinary people," Snake said the bizarre thing he witnessed. "My previous guess was true." The presidency has accepted the existence of the witches. Like the ordinary people, they can make public appearances without any worries, and even fight side by side with everyone!" He paused and said in excitement, "If the white paper is really I sent it there, and it’s definitely not too bad.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, you still want to see her?" It is said that witches are rare talents. If you go to find her, it will only embarrass her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
