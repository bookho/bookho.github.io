			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco entered the arched round house at the top of the main tower of the Bishui Port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the common castles, this tower building is taller and narrower. In addition to handling government affairs and sightseeing, I am afraid that even the convening of the ministers will not be possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furnishings in the room have not been moved, as if the main talent had just left, they will return soon. Directly facing the entrance is a red-brown square table. The books on the table are neatly arranged. There are also a few unfinished manuscripts in the center. The quill pen is inserted in the ink bottle and can be lifted. Write it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped forward to the table and sat down on the large chair. The chair is covered with a cool pad made of bamboo, which is very suitable for relieving the heat of summer. There is also a large bucket of water next to the chair, which is obviously used to place ice and cool down, but today the weather is a bit gloomy, the dark clouds on the sea are very low, and the room is not stuffy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco leaned over and put his face on the table and sniffed, a faint scent into his nostrils - this is Garcia The favorite blue-berry scent, produced in the cold wind ridge, has a unique sense of coolness compared to roses and rosemary, like the melting of snow in the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only if you use an item for a long time, you can make it taste your own. Without a doubt, his sister always sits in a chair like him on weekdays. Put your hands on the table, listen to your reports, or write a decree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of this, he couldn’t help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha...ha...haha...hahahaha——————————” At the end, Tefco leaned back on the chair On, look up and laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finally won! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiacia gave up the clear water port and gave up the Southland, which also gave up the gray castle throne. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he inquired that the Black Sailing Fleet continued to go north along the coastline, he immediately summoned his men and men, driving more than 5,000 slaves, rats and criminals to the South. West Asia’s old nest, the clear water port, launched an attack. The only resistance came from the sand people in the southern corner. I don't know what kind of promises these people got, and they all rushed forward. And the trouble is that they also have mad pills. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle lasted for nearly half a month, and Tefco took advantage of the large number of people, disintegrating the opponent's counterattacks again and again, and constantly eroding the defense of the sand people. Nearly 3,000 people died in the war of attrition. If they were not affected by the pill, this group of rabble might not dare to step on the battlefield, let alone fight the brutal and fierce sand people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the battle was that he crossed the layers of the body and boarded the Lord’s Tower in the clear water port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Queen of the Water" has become history, and the southern part of the Grey Fort has finally returned to his control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello?" Probably heard his laughter, the knight outside the door pushed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem," Tiefko got up and turned to indicate that he followed himself, then climbed the terrace from the side door of the round house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slightly salty sea breeze blew in the air, the robes were sizzling in the wind, the dark clouds in the distance were getting denser and thicker, it seems that a heavy rain is approaching . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s a pity that he thought that he had intended to witness the port, the wharf and the tower of the three sisters in the flames, and it seemed that they could not do it. In the past six months, he has been leading the army, and he has not been in the king for a month. All the government affairs are entrusted to the former prime minister. Although the Marquis of Wick looks very loyal, the loyalty cannot stop the temptation forever. In addition, Gordon Wimbledon is the best example. He must return to the kingdom as soon as possible to stabilize the undercurrent of the political situation, and the rain in the south is just a few days, he can't wait until that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will return to Wangdu tomorrow morning," Tiefko said. "In addition to the guards and the Knights of the Kings, other knights and mercenaries." I will hand you over to you. Sir Ed. Howth, take care of the South for me, and don't let the sand people step on the gray fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
