			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glowing City Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get off today? Can't you stay here for a while?" Horford looked at Andreia, who was coming to resign, and his heart was mixed." Otto, they don't want to leave with you just to leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have been away from winter for a long time, there are people waiting for me there. "Andreia said frankly, "And nowadays, when the old and new kingships alternate, they should not be time to banquets and play as family successors. Since they are friends, it is enough to meet once." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is indeed different from the past, the count thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She grew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About the negotiations with the Grey Fortress...Do you have any suggestions?" Hofford indulged for a moment, "I want to hear your thoughts." This is very important for the family's decision-making."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know much about government affairs - in the absence of winter city, the person responsible for handling these is not a noble, but It is a freelancer who passes the exam. If you want to find out more, it would be more appropriate to find Hill Fox. He has always had more or less contact with the West." Andreas paused. "If you must say me." If you do, don't make the same mistakes as Ampein."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hovde smiled bitterly, "If you have witnessed what Roland Wimbledon has. After the power, I dared to continue to fight against the Grey Fort. It was impossible to describe it with stupidity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only is power..." Andrea shook her head. "The upcoming war of gods is about the fate of all mankind. At this time, the infighting will only accelerate our demise - whether it is the gray castle or the morning sun. The law exists in the catastrophe. If this is the case, how can the family get the most benefit, you must know better than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continuation is the best interest." Horford quickly understood what was meant by her daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the hope of continuation is now on the body of Roland." She applauded, "so control the order of the morning, firmly stand in the gray fort On this side, the concerted effort to get through the battle of God is the only suggestion I can give."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Quinn nodded slowly," ...I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Andrea turned around, he couldn’t help but stopped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to go off, there are still a lot of things to do afterwards." You don't have to worry about my safety. The god witch will join me in returning to no winter," she said with a sideways face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, what I want to say is... sorry, daughter." When this sentence was spoken, Horford suddenly felt that he was a lot older, but in his heart. It is also a lot easier. In fact, there are many things he wants to pour. For example, when she sent her away, it was really for the family. Can’t say that there is no protection for her at all; for example, he regrets not discussing this with his wife beforehand. If he comes, he won't necessarily do it in such a rude way; and when he hears from Otto that she is still alive and has a good news, the joy of her heart...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Earl Quin is more aware that the damage has already occurred, and even if those words are spoken, falling into the other’s ears is nothing but shirking or making up. This is the price of choice. Andrea has grown to the point where it is today, and he can't be too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the talk, the old count closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... then I am gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daughter’s footsteps are getting farther away, Finally disappeared in the ear. Although he did not hear the expectant father, but the same, the other party's tone was not as cold as a few days ago. At least this time, she did not call him the Earl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So good, he thought, this is just a farewell, and there will be a reunion later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice of ten years ago made him lose a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hofd Quinn intends to correct the error with the same amount of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After leaving Bailangwan, the ship entered the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anpein put down the map in his hand and looked out the porthole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This route is one of the main shopping routes to the Wolf Harbor, and you can see the merchant ships from time to time. Occasionally, fishermen’s boats will come together and sell some fresh fish and vegetables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is still a king, the three-wheeled sea boat that is driving around him should be the flag of the king’s house. If you want to eat fresh food, you will naturally have a waitress. It’s only up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything blames the damn traitors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a week since he was rushed to the throne, and he has been thinking about resuming the journey all the time. Even if you can't take the King of the Grey Fort, you can't let the three big families comfortably lie on the city that belongs to him and enjoy the fruits of rebellion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeated considerations, Anpein finally selected his first stop, the Thousand Fortress of the Wolfheart Kingdom. It is close to the dawn of the morning, and it is rumored that its lord has a blood relationship with the morning monks, and should not be too mean for the Moya family. The most important thing is that the aristocrats in the two places have a very close exchange. If someone wants to use his identity to do something, he can easily contact him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t look at the lords’ desires before, in the final analysis, they are all for the benefit. Now he is no longer the ruler of the Glow City, and naturally there is no basis for conflict. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only that, but his bloodlines can be a tool for them to gain new benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to retaliate, Anpein decided to temporarily succumb to himself, and when the time is ripe, those who despise him will surely taste the bitter fruit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of this, he felt a lot of heart, and there was a sense of hunger in his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s good to eat some fruits first. Once you leave the coastal area of ​​the morning sun, this route will be much deserted, and he just heard the sound of the fishing boat connecting the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anpein shakes the string in front of the table - it connects the bells outside the house, and as soon as the ring is heard, the maid will come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there was no response outside this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brow wrinkled immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you fall into a maid who dares to be lazy? In the blink of an eye, he was killed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if it’s her negligence, it’s not bad to use her as a warning. In addition to the members of the Moya family and the knights who pledge allegiance to the accomplices, others are becoming less and less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to let those people know that even if he is on a ship, it should be no different from the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anpei got up and walked out of the room, only to find that there was no one in the aisle, not only the maid, the sailors, the guards, the slaves... all disappeared. The cabin was terribly quiet, leaving only the rustling of the sea to beat the hull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold hair on his back is upright -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something is wrong here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did he be abandoned? No... It’s impossible, even if the mercenaries and servants want to abandon him, the family-trained guards will definitely stand up and stop them. The two sides will not have a voice when they argue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anpein is going to climb from the stairway of the master bedroom to the deck, where there should be a sailor in any case. Just turned around, he saw a bloody short sword on his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
