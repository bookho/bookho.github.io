			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project team did not mention the new fighter. Without considering the electronic equipment, the upper limit of the monoplane is higher than that of the biplane, but the final write The one-year plan is still based on the transformation plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This judgment is made by Chief Wu, the chief technical officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also learned a new concept from the conference: time efficiency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is, any engineering product on the assembly line will increase productivity over time, even if it does not change itself, this phenomenon will spontaneously appear. The reason is that processing is a good job, and workers will become familiar with the way the production line operates, including the interaction between people and machinery and the interaction between people. This has nothing to do with literacy. It is more of a lazy nature. Everyone will take the initiative to find a shortcut that is the easiest to accomplish, and even improve the irrationality of the process. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the production speed and pass rate of an industrial product in the late stage is not only much higher than the early stage, but also the cost is much lower, which is why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want an empty knight to form a scale as early as possible, then the production line that is up and running should be kept unchanged for the time being, which helps workers to be familiar with the machining and operation process of the machine. It will not let the equipment drag the hind legs of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improvement of Skyfire is mainly in the body modification, more powerful engine and new weapon system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is not to mention, the Skyfire is completely a product of Roland’s antique machine drawings in the dream, relying on experience to find out the product – even though the maximum speed does not exceed For a 150-kilometer biplane, the aerodynamic layout is not a problem, but it does not mean that it has no benefits. Quite the contrary, with the support of wind tunnels and simulation techniques, modifying the work of the airfoil is the least expensive and extremely easy to improve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The engine is obviously the most important thing - as the saying goes, as long as the power is enough, the bricks can be super-maneuverable. Once the power goes up, other improvements are all right. . However, even the most basic piston machine, considering the low level of technology after the end of the day, but also the durability and performance, is not so easy to design. It is said that the relevant team has completed seven or eight trial production plans in one breath. It takes time to determine which engine to use as the optimal solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much concern with the new weapon system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s said that the technology is not high, the military has a lot of mature and has been eliminated, such as 20mm cannons, removable missiles Rack and so on. What to install and how to install it depends on the first two improvements, which are content that can be added at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the technical indicators given by the project team, the two-type biplane will have a cruising speed of 250 kilometers and can be used to mount two 100 kg auxiliary fuel tanks. The voyage is more than one thousand kilometers, and both the climb speed and the ceiling limit are significantly higher than the Skyfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the improved biplane can go from the rear to the front line in one day, or from the front line to the large rift on the continental spine. Taking into account the rugged terrain of the source of the desolate mountains, the ordinary army is difficult to pass, this parameter is undoubtedly of great significance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is the bomber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the most expensive and controversial project of all programs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a matter of half a day to discuss the problem of dealing with degraded demons. The reason for the opponents is simple, bombing the ground target. The live, biplane can also be dry, nothing more than a little load of oil. However, large bombers need more professional landing and landing, more maintenance personnel, and will certainly bring a lot of pressure to logistics. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it scores higher on the bombing, it needs the fighter to provide escort when it can be dispatched, but it reduces the utilization of the Air Force as a whole - flight fear The beast has limited means of facing flexible and maneuverable fighters. It is not the case that it is replaced by a clumsy bomber. As long as it does not count the impact of life, it can bring extremely serious damage to the aircraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, there are special demon-like people in the enemy who are similar to the martial arts, which further exacerbates the uncertainty of risk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
