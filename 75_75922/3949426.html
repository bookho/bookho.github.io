			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your, why is my brother still not having any news yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide's words let Tiffco gave a slight glimpse. Indeed, it was two months before Lehman Hoss’s looting of the West. If you counted back and forth, you should report the situation or return to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although several of the tasks assigned to Lehman "have the right to control the West as much as possible", but Fefeco knows clearly, that is 1,500 After taking the pills, people are almost a waste. It is not possible to rely on them to occupy the western environment. Therefore, the main purpose is still to seize the pills in the fortress church, to find out the detailed process of the Duke’s battle, and finally to attack the border town and consume a round. Roland has a living force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trick is used to deal with Garcia can be said to be tried and tested, even if there is no attack on the clear water port, the militia team used to consume opponents is completely annihilated, the Cavaliers leading the team also Most can return safely. As long as a group of useless people are assembled, they can continue to launch attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but why did Lehman Hoss and the Cavaliers have no news at all? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe he delayed the return because of the attacking town, or he was on his way back," Tiefco said slowly, the persuasiveness of these reasons is obviously Not strong, but he didn't want to say the most likely answer in front of Lehman's brother. "Maybe when I return to Wangdu, I can receive the news from him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, can you please?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me his message?" Tiefco nodded. "Of course, I will send the messenger."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new king is holding the railing and watching the occasional light in the dark clouds. The thunder seemed to come from far away, but the voice was not big, but it was dull and honest, as if it was directly hitting the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide’s question has made his heart’s joy fade a lot, if Garcia Wimbledon’s rebellion is taken for granted, Tilly Wimbledon The departure of him made him disappointed, then Roland Wimbledon’s move was completely ridiculous. I thought that this incompetent younger brother did not need to pay attention to it. As long as he had been bored with the life of a poor town for a while, he could not even come to Wangdu, but the actual situation was completely beyond his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; staying in Bianbu Town, safely through the demon moon, defeating the Duke of Ryan, capturing the long-song fortress, and even making Lehman’s 1,500 militia completely lost contact How did he do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this younger brother, Tiffco did not know much about it. When he was a child, whether he was Jiaxia or Goron, he didn’t like to play with him. When he was an adult, he even I only saw one side at the court banquet, but his stubborn deeds have been endless, and even his father did not like him. Is it right from the beginning that he is hiding his own nature? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco quickly vetoed his own ideas, even if they were smart, like the five sisters, they only showed their ability to learn and react, and their childhood personality and Ordinary girls are no different—how can a person know how to cover up and deceive if he is born? He must have encountered something after going to Bianbu Town, which made the change now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco shook his head and left these distractions behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, squat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, nothing," New King took a breath "The storm is coming soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what he encountered, the population and location of Bentham Town is doomed to have no way to go - no port, There is no fleet, and there is a wild land behind it. He can only stay in that corner until he is exhausted by his own offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you insist on going tomorrow?" the Cavaliers asked worriedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you encounter some rain, stop and how to meet the real storm?" Tefco turned. Roland. Wimbledon will soon fall down at his feet and beg forgiveness. The crown of the king of the gray castle will surely be worn on his head. However, these are just the curtain. The movements and intentions of the church are becoming more and more obvious. One day, the gray castle will fight against the church, and that is the real challenge. "Go to your business, and get back to the king as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
