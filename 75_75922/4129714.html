			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this is really wonderful," Barov said with a beard. "It turns out that even running can be so exciting!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Indeed, when I saw the scene when the three started to go in, I felt that my heartbeat was a little faster," said Long Song, the governor, Pei Luo. "Unfortunately, only one person can get it." The commemorative badge has to be said to be a pity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really regret?" The boss smiled slightly. "The long-song player who won the medal, I would rather have more than a few times to focus on the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where, Miss Kwai is just lucky enough. If there is no accident. Next year's Victory Day Games will definitely get you what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... I am worried about that accident."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha, often things can't be called accidents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔... A match results can be hidden machine front, the two men really come together, Roland glanced around the talk of Barov and Pelor, mind could not help myself. Ming next year, the difference is nearly 20 years old, but there is no sense of generation gap, it is worthy of being a veteran in the political arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the first few people have already known, everyone has been a lot easier, and they talked about the game while waiting for the rest to reach the end. Undoubtedly, this kind of competitive project that fits humanity's pursuit of its own extreme psychology is inherently highly affable and attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true of the atmosphere in the witch seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the group of girls who were eager to try, Roland couldn’t help but raise his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way for witches to participate because the gap between the two is too great. In order not to dampen the enthusiasm of the masses, such rules are formulated - not only with magic People, even the goddess of Tahira's gods, also refused. But now it seems that it is a matter of time before the superpower field is held. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what they would look like when they used their abilities in sports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world sports meeting, is this the same?" Anna’s voice pulled him out of his thoughts. "In the first half of the game, you look quite Absent-minded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there are no commentators and live broadcasts," Roland exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean, let everyone know the progress and details of the game at any time?" Anna’s eyes suddenly lit up. "How did that?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This explanation is complicated," he smiled. "Do you remember the TV I said..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are not used to the later generations of the viewing mode, in fact, this game can be said to be perfect - a large number of respondents, a variety of styles of players, the process is brilliant, the ending is unexpected. Whether it is Carter wearing a knight's cloak, or Mo Jinshamin, a cos-wolf woman in the eyes of the public, has stirred up enough topics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the news from the book, the winner of the winner Kwai is also quite dramatic - she used to be a black street mouse, after the liberation of the long song, became a A glorious postman, running all day in the streets of Changge Fortress. It was this job that gave her the favor of the goddess of victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although pure contrast strength, Kwai and the other three have a big gap, but the champion is the champion, not to mention the result, Roland is more concerned about the impact . And her aspirations are undoubtedly reminiscent of the slogan of labor changing destiny, which is the example that no winter city needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky was full of red clouds, the first sports meeting also basically came to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents who arrived in succession gathered in the audience, forming a black sea of ​​people, everyone looked forward to, and excitedly waited for the final award ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
