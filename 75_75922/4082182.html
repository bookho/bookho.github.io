			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next three days, news about the front line continued. When he heard that the nightingale magic was exhausted and he was in a coma, his heart was tightened a lot. Fortunately, the other party did not have any serious problems. When the news was delivered, it was basically restored. He also sent a message to him, so that he did not have to worry about himself. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the exploration show that there is indeed a remnant of underground civilization in the snowy mountains, but its preservation is far from being intact in the desolate mountains. Most of the caves have collapsed, and the remaining compartments are filled with spoiled food, eggs and corpses. Not far from the underground lake, the Takira witch also found the magic core that had been damaged. The valuable literature was almost never left. The only harvest at present is only one original carrier and two phagocytic worms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Roland feel a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the multi-eyed monster on the lake is just a beast, but it happens to be a nest suitable for a family, it’s nothing strange. of. But the other side is obviously not an unwise IQ, driving the worm to devour Aegusa's lab and the Blackrock Pagoda in the Devil's Camp are not related to predation, plus the strange worms that are found in the ground and wrapped around the devil and humans. There is a suspicion of deliberately collecting information from both communities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when the first "bug corpses" were shipped back, he noticed that the victim's broken skin was not caused by corrosion, but was stored for a long time. The waxing phenomenon that appears below. This indicates that the corpse in the worm sac has been in existence for a long time, not as much as preparing for the ration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This behavior of making other creatures into specimens is obviously only for intelligent individuals. If so, why should it toss the remains of the remains? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or to say...the things that the Takira witches value, the monsters don’t care? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at the "live photo" that Soroya had drawn, and he thought about it for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the monster finally falls into the water, the strong hatred revealed by the hundreds of scarlet eyes that remain is like the essence - I don’t know if it’s an illusion, compared to one The magic eye that began to appear at the top of the cave, it seems to have something more in the eyes after it was hit, as if it was just a simple gaze, and the back is very bright, especially the two pictures are put together. When comparing, there is a feeling that the two are not the same monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the lake at the bottom of the ruins, Sylvie has confirmed its flow—the water that leads to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And according to the level of skill he currently has, once the enemy breaks into the whirlpool, it is completely lost. What can be done afterwards is only the collapse of the remains of the ruins, and the groundwater veins are completely sealed to ensure the safety of the rear of the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is no good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of Lightning mentions that Fran is bound by a colloid that is squirted by a reptile, and that the worm is covered with the corpse of the corpse. The worms are of the same type, and the mucus in their body seems to be able to solidify quickly under certain conditions and produce a strong cohesive force, just like a spider. At the same time, these reptiles have no intelligence at all, and they are not attacking. Ai Gesha has already studied it and confirmed that it does not belong to any species in the fertile plains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, this reptile is most likely to be brought by the "monster". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland doesn't care where it comes from, he cares about the glue that can solidify quickly, and according to the description of lightning, there may be artificial breeding possibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the reply, he asked Ai Gesha to make a detailed report on the harmfulness, predation range and living habits of the new species; Plants and fungi are also in the collection task, especially the fruit that emits dark and chilly light. He is particularly interested in giant mushrooms that are comparable in size to adults. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Roland was preparing to look at the wonders of the world at the bottom of the hole, a knock on the door was heard outside the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Felice who walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said after the ceremony, "Your Majesty, President Pasha hopes to talk to you about the relics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
