			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Six months...Is this track to the depths of the wild?" After listening to Roland’s plan, I have seen many "miracle" bars. Rove still dared to widen his eyes. "The Ministry of Construction is building an ordinary road connecting the borders and long songs. It took more than half a year. Now the distance is at least five times that of Wangdao Avenue. Are you sure that Mr. Carl can do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene also sounded a whisper, and Kingdom Road was the first super large after Roland took over the long song fortress. The project, which used as many as 2,000 workers, was regarded as a meaningless act in the eyes of many people. The new road has to go further, and with the limitation of the construction period, it is difficult to satisfy even if all the workers in the winter city are not invested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction Minister Carl Vabert himself did not say a word, as if thinking about the feasibility of the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows what these officials are thinking about. After all, there are still many urban construction projects. It is impossible to put all the resources on the railway, but in fact it is more It is much more convenient to lay the roadbed meteorites on the cement gravel pavement where the materials are graded and repeatedly crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the seemingly complicated rail installation, it is the quickest part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen Anna’s black fire soldering demonstration, a component like a track that connects two breakpoints at a time, averaging less than ten seconds. Compared with the traditional bolt or hot-melt connection, not only the quality is better, but also a lot of manpower and materials are saved. In addition to the lack of the feeling of the old train, the sound can be described as perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the experimental track in front of everyone is a quasi-seamless rail. In addition to the joints left against the steel's own temperature stress, the entire top surface forms a smooth straight line, and the wheel barely feels tremor when it rolls over it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, Anna only took half a day to complete the process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Roland is confident that the duration will be so short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the workers spend ten days laying out the road base, the leaves may take five days to put the sleepers and rails, and Anna can only one day All welded. If you don't deliberately accumulate the quantity, that is, take the wheat in the morning and go back to the castle to eat lunch at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he didn’t elaborate on this. After all, not everyone knows the witch’s ability, and the other half is only a rough estimate. When he first arrived in the Winter City, he went straight to the wolf woman and the meeting. They couldn’t find Tilly to ask the witches who came to sleep in the island. If there is a suitable ability, the railway progress may be faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Roland didn’t say much, the officials turned their attention back to the train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train itself is undoubtedly much more antique than the modern railway. A complete front is divided into two sections. The first half consists mainly of the fourth-generation steam engine and transmission, and the second half is the coal storage vehicle. The cab is in the middle. In addition to controlling the speed and sounding the whistle, it is also the driver's responsibility to add coal to the boiler by manpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the train is affected by the expedition, it is still in the semi-finished stage, but it is still much better than the other world's first steam locomotive. For example, steam directly works on the crankshaft rather than through the flywheel belt, and on both sides of the wheel, the linkage mechanism without dead ends is used instead of the single-wheel drive by the gear set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of design, Roland simplifies all kinds of cumbersome functions, almost directly put together several major components together, if you look at the future Its inadequacies are more like stars - the brakes need to be twisted by the human hand and the cab is rigidly connected to the girders. The driver can fully feel the "tilt" of the steam engine when working, without any power equipment, notify the crew It needs to rely on whistle or scorpion, etc... But here, it is already the best solution that can be solved without the existing technology of Winter City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the original steam engine, first solve the problem, and then improve step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, this thing... can drag multiple goods?" Chemical Minister Kemer Stoul curiously said, "Compared to the cement in the river." How is the ship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
