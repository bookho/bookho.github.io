			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is all because of Heckod's betrayal! Dear King, please let me kill it!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a deafening roar of bloody roar in the Holy See. It can be seen from the blue veins that ignited from the top of the head and the hot air ejected from the mouth. It is a real anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other Maharaja's face is also quite gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Nasopelle is expressionless and even wants to laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a bunch of idiots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has warned them long ago, but unfortunately, in addition to innocent, other monarchs colluded with the Supreme Lord and took the initiative to do it. This matter will be suspicious. Even if it showed the memory to the king, these monarchs only suppressed the superficial doubts. I am afraid that my heart still wonders if it has angered the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it looks like a "monster" assembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, they did not wait for the explanations of Heckzod and Cerroshhi, but they came to be the "God of God". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it strange to blame the traitor now, don’t you think it’s too late? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The question is, can you find where it is?" The innocent did not care about the bloody face. "Nekzod may now hide any of the continental spine." A corner, and the same family of Tianzhu City is also likely to be forced to fall to it. In this case, without investing a lot of manpower, it is impossible to find a trace of a Maharaja. Then again..." It glanced at the other side coldly. "Even if you find Heikezod, don't forget that there is Cerroshhi around it, and whoever kills who doesn't know it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You ---!" If this is not a holy seat, I am afraid that blood has already started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Respected King, I don't always understand..." Chaos squirmed with a fat body, "Does humans really find something about God?" Evidence? Otherwise, how can it be with humans in the style of Scorpio?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They all do this, you are still guessing the reason for the betrayal "The mask shouted," "Whatever the reason, Heckzod has a lot of opportunities to report to the king. But actually? It goes from leaving the West Line to the bottomless world to collude with the silence. I have never been in contact with Wangcheng from beginning to end! Obviously, this is a long-planned rebellion! If it is not my ability to make a new breakthrough, I am afraid I will die in the hands of Cerroshhi!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Maharajah was dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fragment of the memory that Wang has drawn, and it is impossible to make a fake, and Heckzod once wandered in the northern end of the Shuguang territory and was confirmed by the sentinel along the line. No matter from which point of view, it is not like a decision made under haste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that's it... Nasopelle raises his mouth slightly, memory can't be forged, but can deliberately erase part when shifting - and it chooses What is hidden is the clue about Wakiris, and the report to the king is also the body that has done the hand and foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that this step is very sensible. If other monarchs find that the two people’s rebellion may involve Wakiris, whose whereabouts are unknown, the situation will only be more complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the date of obtaining human heritage fragments may have to be extended later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It never wants to waste a little more time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mask is good, or focus on the floating island of humans. They are obviously directed at Wangcheng." Please shout, "The enemy is suspended in midair and surrounded by firearms. It is not suitable for bloody and dead-minded monarchs. I only want to stop them when I want to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innocent and abomination, like the dead, are promoted by the psychic warlock, but it is more inclined to close combat than the mentally controlled person who is strong in confusion and control. This can be done from its costume. Look out - the basic humanoid appearance, wrapped in a black leather jacket, wearing a armor under the body, like a sharp edge of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
