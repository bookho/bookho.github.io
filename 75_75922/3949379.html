			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was full of various test items on the office floor early in the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From solids to liquids, minerals to ingots, inorganics to organics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look very happy." The night squats, picks up the small soup bag in the plate and throws it into his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, there is another new witch in the town, and her ability is so incredible," Roland picked an eyebrow. "In addition, don't think I didn't see it, did you just steal the guinea pig?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are several more," she wiped her mouth, "Lucia's ability Very useful?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The use of greatness, whether it is decomposition or reduction, can make great progress in smelting and manufacturing.” Roland said excitedly. "With Anna, you can increase the strength of the machine several times. Even if you don't have energy, just make a few masters by hand, which is definitely a qualitative improvement for the production level of the town."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine tool used in the factory of the Grey Fort Industrial Company is now processed by Anna. Although it is extremely accurate at the beginning, it is limited to the defects of the material itself. The wear and deformation of the machine tool in the production process is becoming more and more obvious. It is a common phenomenon that the cutter is broken and broken. These machines can only be used for a maximum of one or two years without Anna's supplementary maintenance parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucia has the ability to precisely control the composition of materials, using high-strength cast iron, steel, and even alloy machines to improve service life. Processing efficiency and processing level can also reach a new level. For example, the revolver gun, which can only be produced by Anna for a while, can also enter the sequence of mass production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" The nightingale jumped back to the table. "But she doesn't seem to think so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Because she hasn't really realized the value of her ability, it is the same as the mystery month." Roland didn't think. "If Lucia can finish reading the "Theory of Natural Science Theory," I will definitely not have another Such an idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The night snorted silently stuffed two fish in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lucia finished breakfast, came to the office and the ability test officially began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked forward with anticipation that she turned each test piece into a pile or a small pile of different substances - iron ingots and iron ore became Silver-white particles, if you look closely, you can find some variegated powder on the side. The grapes and steaks did not change, and the dumplings turned into water, meat and flour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was halfway through, she suddenly stopped, and some embarrassedly said: "I seem to... exhausted the magic."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at the nightingale, and the latter nodded. "The magic stored in her body is very small. It looks like a smoggy smog, but this color is the first time I look at it. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What color?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...grey," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland returned to his desk and waved at Lucia. "The magic of the witch is growing with age and training. You have no adulthood. This step is very good.” When the little girl went to the table, he pushed the parchment that had already been prepared to the other side. “Since you decide to stay in Bianbu Town, sign this contract.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia looked down at the end of the contract and couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. "One month, one golden dragon? Your Highness... Yes, but my ability has not been tested yet. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has nothing to do with your ability," Roland smiled and shook his head. "As long as you are a member of the Witch Alliance, this contract will last forever." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if the ability of the witch is useless?" she asked incredulously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can also understand this," the prince said. "But I believe that any witch's ability has its own unique use, but the discovery is different. That's all. So you don't have to worry that you can't use it." He paused. "In addition, you should have heard the real reason for the magical phagosome from other witches, so in order to ensure a smooth ride through the awakening day, you have to do it every day. Repeatedly practice your abilities. After dinner, the book teacher will teach the witches in the living room, and you have to go to the lectures - although you have mastered the literacy, it is necessary to learn the elementary mathematics and natural foundation courses."
