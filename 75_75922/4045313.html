			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, I plan to build a landmark building in No Winter City," Roland continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Placemark?" Carl recovered quickly after the excitement. "Do you mean a striking building like a monument or a bell tower?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can also call it a spectacle." It is the top character of the original Wangdu stonemason, and can respond so quickly to the new noun. Roland nodded first and then shook his head. "But I am not prepared to build landmarks that have no practical value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army suffered the most serious damage after fighting the church, despite the iron axe report It is said that the morale of the army has not been frustrated, but the family grief caused by casualties cannot be avoided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to strengthen the confidence of the people, especially the people of other places, he thought of the spectacle that can be amazing. Of course, some wonders in history are built entirely to satisfy the private desires of the rulers. There is no benefit to the builders. Even if they can demonstrate national strength, Roland will not do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I plan to build a residential building on the south bank of the Chishui River, behind the industrial park."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Carl did not speak, he apparently realized that this building is definitely not ordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is very satisfied with the calmness of the other party. "It will have about 15 floors. According to the calculation of one layer of three meters, the height of this building will exceed 50 meters. In other words, it is close to the height of the four old kings' walls - that is the most magnificent project you have ever participated in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sucks The mouth was cool, "Your Majesty, this is a Tongtian Tower!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Itâ€™s just a normal high-rise building." Roland Laughing, "But in this era, it is not too much to use as a landmark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The height of the fifteenth floor means that it will far exceed the castle, just enter Without the winter city boundary, you can see this tall building at a glance. It can not only symbolize the strength of no winter, but also make up for the problem of housing shortage. After all, the high-rise housing volume ratio is much higher than that of the bungalows, which is why more and more skyscrapers are coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can the house really be built so high?" Carl seemed to have some doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For concrete, this is far from the limit." Roland indulged in a moment, "I will personally guide you through it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the interlacing is like a mountain, the mechanics and structural principles are still universal. Before proposing this idea, he has already done too many considerations: the height seems to be amazing, but it is not the case. For example, the Pyramid of Khufu, built more than 2,000 years ago, is more than 140 meters. The stone is up. There are also more than one hundred and thirty meters of wooden pagodas in China - as long as the support is strong enough, height is not a big problem. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to save materials, the wall column volume will be reduced as much as possible to meet the stable conditions. Without the current cement production in winter city, there is an excess of cement. A good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the structure of the tower-like design of the multi-story podium, although it will occupy a part of the extra land, can greatly enhance the structural stability, but also Reduce the difficulty of construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called structural instability is more than the column, the level is not enough steel, as long as the foundation is solid enough, it is difficult to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last difficulty is the concrete watering work - this Roland has also been considered, that is, let the wheat python bring the hummingbird to take off, the hummingbird carrying the tin can Pour concrete from the air, the efficiency is not much lower than the pump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Carl had experience in building a witch building, it was also a concrete structure, this time just to expand the scale a bit larger. And when the bamboo ribs and iron wire will be replaced by real steel bars, and the Witch Alliance as a technical support, he is full of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Time is up, let's put the pen down," the book knocked on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
