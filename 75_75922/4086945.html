			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, a strangely shaped cement boat slowly left the Wintertown Pier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s flat on the deck, and it’s sturdy and covered with linen, like a moving hill. On both sides of the chord, there are not only soldiers armed with live ammunition, but also more than a dozen sacred witches who serve as escorts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ship is the Victory, it is responsible for the soul instrument to the snowy mountain, where the Takira witch will complete the transformation ceremony, attached to the worm Above the carrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the need for confidentiality, there was no ritual before the departure, nor did the whistle sound, even the loading work was quietly completed at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stood by the wet brick pier and watched the ship leave. Once the conversion is completed, no winter city will have three worm carriers, and both the municipal construction and the desperate defense project have sufficient strength to carry out the implementation. This is a good thing, but he is not as happy as he imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two witches who volunteered to be converted were called Jasmine and one was called Laila. After recovering from the real world in the dream world, both of them are just girls in their early twenties. They look like Tilly, and their temper is very active. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland in line with the plan to let them enjoy it, with the volunteers and Felice and others, deliberately went to the playground in the suburbs. Ferris wheel, roller coaster, haunted house (Jasmine also missed a ghost head that fell from the sky), and the big pendulum played all over again, and the food was not limited. If it weren't for a while before the robbers, he couldn't afford to pay for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two days, Jasmine and Lyra were full of surprises and disbelief, but never asked more, where to go where to go. When you are sitting on a roller coaster, you will scream like everyone else. When you eat the strawberry sundae, you will laugh as happy as the girl next door. It looks just like ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t know the answer in advance, no one will believe that the two have made the decision to give up the human body and resolutely sacrifice their own for the devil. lifetime. It's like the choices made at the bottom of the relics four hundred years ago, when they faced the core of the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they finally woke up, their look was calmer than Roland expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to comfort two people, but if he is in the throat, he can’t say a word. Let them reconsider whether it turns into a phagocytic worm? This is neither in his interest nor in the interests of the united front. In addition, the rest of the words seem meaningless, more like the hypocrisy of things that are not related to oneself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, it was him who was comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has clearly remembered the words and eyes of the two at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Jasmine said with a smile, "and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We No regrets," Laila added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, he seemed to hear the heartbeat of the two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t like it all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they don't regret it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello?" Felice, who was off the line, looked at him. "You... don't you go back to the castle?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has only come back, the victory has disappeared at the end of the field of vision, leaving only a little smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed his thoughts and took a deep breath. "Is there really no way to cut off consciousness after possessing the carrier?"<br /><br />&nbsp ; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis seems to understand what he wants to say, a little lighter, "Divine witches and carriers are different, the former has a certain basic consciousness even if they do not transfer the soul, the witch does not say Convergence, it is better to say that the controller is more suitable. But the carrier is different, it is a special container, once connected, it is closely connected, although it can go to sleep when not in use for a long time, but it has not been realized completely - at least They can't do this in Pasha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's right," Felice nodded. "Without magic support, such a huge body can't move at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So maybe one day, We can also find ways to get their souls back to the world of dreams," Roland looked up and looked at the deep blue sky, slowly speaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment of silence, Felice looked with his gaze. "Well... maybe they will wait until that day."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The western jungle covered by snow is a new visual experience for Lorca. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She listened to the traveller more than once and said what the snow looks like, and it’s equated with the cold white sand in her mind, but when I see it with my own eyes, It was discovered that the snow was much finer and more white than the gravel. Even the purest river sand in Yinchuan is not as clear as the snow everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world seems to have changed a layer of color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the evil moon is over, the ashes tell her that it takes at least half a month to really wait for the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is good, she thought, so that she could see a pure white Syracuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the voyage, there is almost nothing that can be done. Luo Jia has visited the steel ship inside and outside, and has never been able to find out if it can The reason for the wind is automatic. Even if I asked Andrea for this question, I couldn't get a definitive answer. I only knew that there was a machine that kept boiling water. I was dragging the hull. As for how to drag it, the defendant only had Luo Lan and Miss Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former does not talk about, the latter is also considered to be a member of the "Winterless Power List" in the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong ability, and at the same time, he is very knowledgeable. The Princess of the Flames has a deeper impression on the name Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when talking about this with Andrea, the latter sneered at the disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Combat ability ranking?" She rolled her eyes. "The man and the wolf are different. One person is stronger and less powerful than the group. The strength of the individual, is it not the general knowledge of the lower beast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wolf is also a group action," Luo Jia corrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, then switch to other animals, such as tigers, snow leopards, etc..." Andrea coughed twice. "In short, Anna is no. The roots of all the strengths of the Winter City, the reason why the First Army was able to defeat the watchdog and the Iron Whip clan, a large part of it relied on Anna’s ability. And I guess she must have told you that she almost lost to "An ordinary person's business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the surprised wolf woman, she showed such a look, "And the ordinary person is holding Anna's weapon - stripping these to talk about combat ability, is meaningless. If you want to become stronger, I suggest you apply for a special weapon to your Majesty," said Andrea patted here. The long gun behind, "If you can put those big pipes on the back of your transformation, it is more effective than any combat technique."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Luo Jia does not How to agree with this statement, but still silently remember this suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, my father often said that it is the right thing to listen more and more, but don’t forget your original intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the anti-water boating and the soaring river, the speed of the iron boat has slowed down significantly. On the fifth day of entering the West, the wolf girl saw a beautiful and strong pigeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few laps in the air, it flew straight toward the ashes of the bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when she thought that she could add a meal at noon, she found that the latter smiled and took out a piece of fried dry food and licked it to the other party. The pigeons licked the ashes of the ashes, like old friends who had not seen them for a long time. Until it spoke, Luo Jia realized that it was a witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕,咕咕!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
