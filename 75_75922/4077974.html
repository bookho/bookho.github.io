			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New City... Built in this place? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddi can hardly believe his ears. The more the Yinchuan is going south, the smaller it is. The black line is almost completely engulfed by the yellow sand. This is also the origin of the exile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without water and oasis, how can you survive in this desert? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire ship’s sand people are all stunned by Thuram’s words, and more than one person has raised the same doubts as him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without water, we can make it ourselves," Thuram replied loudly. "Before that, the leader had found a source of water that could be used." You can see it when you get off the boat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snoring has not subsided, but has become bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Create?" Someone said, "How to make?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yinchuan is the land How can we do this with the gift of the mother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Three Gods are on, only the gods can make the desert an oasis..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we can't do it, can we still go back to the South?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, you won't I want to leave us here, and one person ran back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of everyone's doubts, Thuram hesitated for the first time. Simbadi noticed that he had sneaked a glimpse of the gray-great man behind him and gritted his teeth. "The great chief is omnipotent. He said that it can be made. You can obey the order! And the silver moon promised, if I can't achieve this. You can not only return to the clear water port in advance, but also get a full reward for three months!" He said that he took a whip around his waist. "Of course I will not leave early - if anyone wants If you are lazy, you are ready to taste the taste of the iron whip!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that...Sinbad realizes that Thuram is not the manager of this team. Those who are standing in the back of the gray-skinned people are the real masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the sacred duel, he heard about the power of this group more than once, and unlike the clear water queen, even if they fight in front, they don’t lose the big clan at all. warrior. But here is the endless cape, even if they can beat the watchdog overnight, it is only a negligible part of the boundless sand sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether it is a North Korean or a Grand Chief, I am afraid that the power of the desert is far underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are no more choices on board. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about half an hour, the stone boat slowly leaned against the shore, and Simbadi dragged the sore and tired body off the boat until his feet fell on the soft sand. At that moment, he felt the ease of a long absence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is finally no longer shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, what is that?" Muli pointed to the depths of the land, "Sentinel Tower?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He looked at each other's eyes, only to see a black iron frame standing in the yellow sand, it seems not far from the coast, its top is flying two flags, one side is bright red, the other side seems embroidered Complex patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s normal, Simbadi will be thinking about why only the girl who talks occasionally will stay with me, but now he has no strength to think about it. The question is, "Someone... got here first?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's check it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; "Will," he shook his head. "It’s better to wait for Tulam’s instructions to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sanders who fall into the water Still let Xinbadi remember the new, he does not want his own people to be punished by the iron whip in the public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Murly, finally found you!" The people of the same family gradually came together, "Sinbad, are you here too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha ha ha..." This caused a low laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddi is embarrassed to bow his head. He is indeed the weaker one in the family, whether it is strength or courage. Usually I was told that it was okay, but in front of Molly, he felt a bit hot on his cheeks - in fact, he was not as good as Molly in the days of sailing on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, there is an iron tower there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did they put such a heavy thing? Moved here?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Probably a boat? I heard that the Grey Fortress has a fairway that leads to the endless cape.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will we camp there tonight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should be wrong, endless cape is more dangerous than oasis Many people must be guarded at night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fishbone clan has a total of more than 20 people, which is the least of the clan, but this scale has been called It’s all green and strong. One of them, Karon’s peers, is one of the best. He looks tall and handsome, not only has his skills, but also is loved by the patriarchs. When he speaks, he attracts everyone’s eyes. “I He has been involved in the exile of Tiesha City. Whether it is a sand worm or a drug lord, it is much bigger than the oasis. Even the rumored giant armor that dominates the earth is also active in this area, so everyone must be vigilant. At that time, try to set up the tents with the gray castle people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think the words of Tulam’s adults are true? The big chief can really be in the desert. Did you create a piece of water?" someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not a good thing," Caroline snorted. "If he really has this ability, he can become a desert rule without a sacred duel." Then, why bother to do so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do?" Everyone can't help but stir up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, the great chief will not spend so much effort, just to throw us into the exile," his calm voice is full of confidence, "this The second action may be just because of his temporary rise. After the gray castle people found that it could not be realized, our work will be over. As for the three-month salary, the proud sand is absolutely unreliable!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, otherwise who will believe them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you say this, I will be relieved, as long as It’s good to go back.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people nodded, only Sinbad did not reconcile, he agreed with the first half of Caron’s, but the latter half There are still doubts - the Grey Fortress does see the desert, and the plan to turn the endless Cape into a town is doomed to fail. It can be seen by soldiers who wear uniforms and look serious. He faintly thinks that the Grand Chief is not Just talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, people have begun to move toward the tower, the team has become scattered, and Thuram is still talking to the Grey Fortress, it seems to be all about it. Do not smell it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we also going?" The tribe proposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is," Caroline nodded. "If you camped near the tower, you can grab a good position as early as possible. Come with me." He also looked at Molly with a special look. "Do you need me to help you with your bag?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter hesitated and shook his head, "Sinbad Say it's best to wait until Tulam is ordered to go again... Didn't he always insist on discipline?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not on the boat, Even this he has to manage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sinbad, you won't be scared by the endless cape?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He may be still fainting now." The man who had jokes before him shouted again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was just worried--" Simbadi looked up and just wanted to argue a few words, and a rush of whistle interrupted the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
