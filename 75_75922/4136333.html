			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha..." Simbadi took a slap in the mouth, didn't like opportunistic, and got nothing? Even the small clan, most of whom have heard of the names of the fjords - not everyone is good at sailing, but almost every one is a natural businessman, and it is still the kind of no benefit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a lot of Mojin people in Tiesha City who are deceived and laughed. All the sand people know that they must have a 12-point spirit when talking with them, and Daqing Everything that happened in Hong Kong confirms this statement. In the face of the other party's rhetoric, he does not intend to believe in one word. "Is it finished? I still have something to do, you can find someone to go to the name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simbadi made a look at Molly, indicating that she was going with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait!" Rex yelled. "Not free, I am willing to use Golden Dragon as a reward - no matter what the end is!" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sinbaddy, you just listen to him," Moody also grabbed his hand. "I think the things he did are really interesting." It’s not like an ordinary liar.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensing the temperature from the other’s palm, Sinbaddi couldn’t help but feel the heart pounding twice, “But ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten Golden Dragon! As long as you tell me the specific location, I will give you ten golden dragons!" Probably want to prove that he is not lying, Ray Xx took a golden dragon from his arms and put it in front of him. "This is a deposit! If you can help, I will pay twenty more, how!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Sinbaddi’s slight glimpse, it’s a rare thing for the fjords to pay for the goods first, and a total of thirty Golden Dragons’ rewards? After a little bit of thinking in his heart, he understood how big this amount is. If you work alone, I am afraid that I will not be able to get it for ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I also want to buy some new clothes for the children in the family..." Molly glared at the big eyes of the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the double offensive, Simbadi finally lost. "Well, I know. If you dare to lie to us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no loss to you," Rex bounces the Golden Dragon Simbadi, "You can get a golden dragon in just a few words, there is no more cost-effective trading than this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the fjords are There is indeed a set of people who are confusing, and Simbadi catches the flying gold coins. "What do you want to know from me? Why is Molly going with you? What do you mean by the name?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has to start from the beginning," Rex cleared his throat. "Let's talk as we walk. First I want to ask, what impression do you have on the sea?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impression?" He hesitated, "The mother of the Three Gods, the land where all things are born, and...the mood is erratic."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it is mysterious," Muli said with great enthusiasm. "Nobody knows how wide and how deep it is. Even in the extreme south, many areas have not yet been involved. If you change to the sea, I am afraid I will not be able to explore it for thousands of years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right, but for the fjords, it is more vivid. The impression is - treasure house." Rex laughed. "The seabed is quietly placed in countless treasures, there are boxed golden dragons and silver wolves, and there are also lost ancient ruins... they have no cover, just waiting for people to pick them up. It’s not surprising that you get rich overnight. So who can own this treasure, who can be the richest person in the world!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simple," Simbadi dismissed. "Nothing? The sea itself is the biggest barrier. You are not a fish. How can you go to the bottom of the sea at will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's right, this is the problem!” Rex's tone is quite exciting. “The purpose of the Wonder Club is to make the impossible possible. This time I have to prove to everyone that the strange thing is not a Crazy organization, not a cowardly guild! Although we are not explorers, they are not inferior to them. The role... no, it should be more than them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't quite understand what you mean -"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A great invention," the flock of the fjord can't wait to reveal. "I call it "diving gear." With it, humans stay on the sea like a fish for a long time! ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
