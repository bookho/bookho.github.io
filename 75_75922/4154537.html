			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...is the look of the world?" Camilla seemed to realize what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, if you roll the floor up, it’s a map of the world." Roland put down his pen and looked out at the foot. I don't know if it is a coincidence that a fleet of ships from the port of Baros in Spain, after seventy days and nights of sailing, finally arrived in the New World of the Americas, thus rewriting the territory of the world. Now, in the same way, Joan has first proved the general appearance of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the original intentions of the two are different, these findings are real – history will not only remember Joan’s name, but the expedition from now on, estimated It will also become a veritable name because of her "global sailing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that's all in the big direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Roland, the ability to pinpoint the bottomless world and the Tianhai world is undoubtedly the most important thing at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe’s discovery made him confirm that the reality of the ideology is not as far away as imagined, which is obviously good news. At the very least, the new bomber program and the improved version of the Skyfire have a clear purpose in designing performance parameters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Tianhai world above the ocean is somewhat out of reach. Fortunately, they are killing with the devil. Even if they go east, they will land in the first place. The West Bank is still far from the fertile plains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only one last question left," the nightingale whispered. "Who is the woman who happened to Joan on the island? There is no trace of human settlement. If it’s a god-like person, there is no reason to help her?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was silent for a moment, “In fact, this is probably the worst problem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Camilla did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In theory, if the battle of divine war is defeated, it will eventually be destroyed. Then the god is our enemy." He said hesitantly, " The watchers did not show the hostility they deserved, or their concept of good and evil was different from us, or... they didn’t put us at all. This kind of care, probably with the usual we gave the injured The bird is bandaged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two witches face each other and squat in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what followed was the chill of the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone understands that if a group of birds steal the grain, humans will not hesitate to cull them, but no one will ever As a real enemy, occasionally grab two chicks under the cat's claws. The latter approach has nothing to do with good and evil, but it is a personal preference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle of divine war continued for another round and round, I do not know how many ethnic groups are ruining under the watchful eyes of the watchmen, and for the birth and death of civilization, it will not Let the gods have a hint of embarrassment, and they save Joan, and it does not mean that human beings belong to a special category. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... is too terrible," Camilla Darry muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that my guess is wrong," Roland sighed. "But since I want to stop the battle of God, I am afraid I will not escape the gods." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly stop your stupidity, you are fundamental I don't know what I am doing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"--All things will be attributed to nothingness, and the accumulation of thousands of years will be destroyed."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't afford such a crime--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sentence that only echoes in the ear, as if it were a microcosm of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After paying such a price, it will let the battle of divine war continue to this day, how can it easily stop? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
