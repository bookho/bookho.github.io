"I don't know what the design bureau is doing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete everything I need," Roland laughed. "For example, now I want you to build a brand new tractor that must be simple and reliable." It is also easy to manufacture and has certain potential for transformation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There should be a lot of tractors on the market..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My request is of course more than that. The above is just the most basic framework." He shook his head. "First of all, except for the engine, every part has to be us." Produce by yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cost will be very high." Master Xie said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't need to be mass-produced, the price can be compared to some handmade products. I have several collectors who are willing to pay a lot of money to buy them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, there should be no automated machine tool participation in the production process, um ..." Roland looked around for the next four weeks. "These tools in the factory are now very suitable. I need to know the specifications and manufacturing process of each component. That is to say, the design bureau not only has to make it, but also Draw all the layout diagrams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the opposite side, he added, "Of course, I will recruit some freshmen to help you with your work. You just have to arrange for them to do things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's good...If you only rely on pen and paper, I'm afraid it will take half a year to come up with a clue. Come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last point, and the most important." Roland went on, "Make it You have to have a certain imagination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xie Shifu stunned, "What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I give an example, such as this tractor, which uses steam power - so theoretically it requires a large boiler and a compartment for storing fuel and water. But in fact, it does not have As a component, you can imagine its power source as a nuclear-powered engine, just like in a movie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."The other person’s look seems to be somewhat Sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore, when manufacturing a prototype, you must minimize the impact of this part of the 'theoretically needed, but actually non-existing parts', so that you can get it when you test the car. The most suitable data. I said, do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Master Xie thought hard for a while before he carefully returned. "What do you mean, should I imagine it as a product that does not belong to this era?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This summary is perfect." Roland screamed, "I don't know if there is any technical difficulty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no theory, but..." He hesitated, "I don't want you to say, even make it out." I'm afraid there is no practical value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no practical value, right, my collector's friends don't care about those things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xie Shifu breathed a sigh of relief, and then asked again, "That... Mr. Roland, I don’t know the chief Water is ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" it according to your retirement income to count twice as good, "Roland laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the car, Guardian lowered the glass and shrugged at him," How are you still satisfied?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I don't know how to calculate the cost of the factory..." Roland pretended to be polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These details are not mentioned, and it is an honor for the Sanye Group to help the martial arts association." Guardian waved his hand, " I will communicate with the other side and set it down. From today, you are their new boss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Roland wants to get together on his own, I am afraid that it will cost tens of millions to say less, and it may not be able to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Roland does not want to let go of any chance of licking wool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this really good? I wondered, the factory wants to resume normal operation, at least one more people have to be recruited. And in order to increase their enthusiasm The reward and punishment system has to be listed, and these require a lot of money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔..." Guardian thought for a moment, "I later transferred a finance to Hello, if you have any extra expenses, you can say it to her. But Mr. Roland, if the amount is too big, you can't do it. You know the Sanye Group..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "It's not that you have the final say. Rest assured, I won't make you embarrassed." The initiative to send financials is obviously a safe haven, at least to prevent him from burning money unrestrainedly. Roland raised his glass with a smile. "Thank you very much about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a matter of raising your hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The two cups came together in a crisp way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the Agricultural Machinery Factory was officially renamed as the Grey House Design Bureau. Although the appearance is still dilapidated, it is already busy under the temptation of promotion and salary increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the matter, Roland felt that the burden on his shoulders was much easier, When I went to the office every other day, my footsteps were lighter. I thought that he could continue to expand the project and scale of the Grey House Design Bureau. With precious design time left, I couldn’t help but feel happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this way, Anna doesn’t have to work every night until midnight, she can put more energy into her own inventions, which is a lot of things. Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps those employees will never know that the drawings they draw will become reality in another world, and they will fight bloody battles with alien enemies in the corner of the continent. To defend the last continuation and glory of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you smirking, sire..." The nightingale showed his figure in front of him with a contemptuous look. "I was so happy last night?" You won't do anything you shouldn't do in your dreams?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come...I am like that kind of person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night mouth, "In fact, it is normal, I listen to Felice, the ancient witch is not valued for these things, it is no different from eating and sleeping. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Do she really say that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, lie to you." "The nightingale squinted and leaned down. "Are you just paying attention to this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emotions is still a trap for phishing enforcement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can only say that you think too much." Roland glanced at her. "I am so happy because I solved a big problem, it is not you." "I guess it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, honesty is 95%, it’s true." Nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you now be accurate to the single digits of the percentage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, maybe It’s used much more, and I always feel a lot more sensitive than I used to feel.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What’s going on with that 5%? In advance, I can Didn't lie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe it's the incitement that you're subconsciously making." The nightingale raised his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃...Roland is a slogan, he always feels that this will be brought into the trap sooner or later, and will no longer answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," the nightingale chewed for a while and then said, "You haven’t seen the Red Moon recently."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
