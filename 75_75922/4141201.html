			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them gathered their eyes on the speaker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nightmare Maharajah, Vakiris, can be regarded as the most special one of all Maharajas. It was promoted very early, so that most of you have been taken care of by it; during the first war of gods, it was also the closest high-level contact with human beings, and even rumors that there are still believers in some cities. . Although the individual combat ability is not the strongest, it is also fully evolved, but it maintains its appearance after the first promotion - the skin is blue, the head has a horn, and the third is in the center of the frontal bone. eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you say that it is not like human beings, it has a dressing style, words and deeds and a distinct human style. It is also the first Maharaja to master the other language. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This basic and silent disaster is the two extremes - from the nightmare of the thin and delicate white robe can be seen. In order to show his image, each of the filaments on the robes is clearly visible, and the bloody figures such as the shadows are completely like two worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can put a lot of energy into this irrelevant place, the face is so easy to write, it is enough to see its mastery of the conscious world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was scared of it before, Heckzod would never say more than half a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the other party is also the only uncle who can’t see through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other people, the posture of closing the eyes in the sacred seat has long been marked by its disloyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More critically, Wang does not seem to have any opinion on this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? What did you find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I just thought of a Maybe.” Wakiris sat down straight, “First, whether or not there really exists a path of ascension that we don’t understand. Assuming that this male has the same ability as a witch, then this ability must be related to the ideology, and the extent of involvement. It must not be too shallow. Otherwise, in terms of the ability to silence you, it will not be suppressed to such a degree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red light below the silent helmet flashed As a matter of fact, "I have been guarding the fragments for nearly two hundred years. I have seen more than one human being, but most of them ended up with them escaping or being swallowed up. I can be equal to me, only one person in two hundred years, and in one Two years ago - but she is a female."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The witch's words are not surprising. What I want to say is that this person is male and female. It doesn't matter, the focus is on the ability itself. Perhaps even he himself is not aware that this level of involvement has already It is enough to leave traces in the ideology."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I only infer from the results, I agree with your judgment." Heikezod took the opportunity to speak. - After all, this is the area in which it excels. "But what does it mean? The conscious world is more extensive than Wang Yang. It is almost impossible to find these traces."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe." Wakiris can't help, "but I still want to give it a try - using the correlation between the fragments, maybe not hopeless. What do you think?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can't help but say, "Are you already aware of the connection of fragments?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The inheritance obtained from the underground civilization has greatly improved the ethnic group's application level of magic, including the resonance of the birth tower. At the same time, they also realized that whether they use the birth tower to talk or inherit the communication in the debris, they are all done through the consciousness circle. So in theory, as long as you start searching from one end, you can always find the other end connected to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is only theoretically - the conscious world is full of chaos and disorder, like a sea full of whirlpools, wanting to pursue a hidden under the sea The thin line can be imagined. In addition, the deeper the dive, the greater the influence of the turbulent flow of consciousness. It is necessary to do everything in its power to maintain oneself, not to mention the distraction to capture the "connection line". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This method has never been thought of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
