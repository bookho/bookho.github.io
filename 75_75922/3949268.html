			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Aosha clan lost in the duel to the iron whip clan in the back of the land, not only that, but also the patriarch was killed, the clan was exiled The end of the endless cape. As the patriarch's daughter, Zall Silver Moon, which is an echo, because of his outstanding appearance, was sold as a superior slave to a slave trader in Bishui Port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe was adopted by the Aosha clan because of his mixed-blood status, but no sand people regarded him as a real Mojin, so he was not sentenced. exile. On the contrary, because of his high martial arts, he was taken by other clans and wanted to reach out. The iron axe thanked the patriarch for his years of care, and he wanted to save the echo, and did not hesitate to reject other clan. After a hard journey, he finally arrived at the clear water port, but I did not know that the echo had been sold to the Grey Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, one person was saved by the witch and became a member of the Communist Youth League; one person was disheartened to go to the west of the gray fort. To this day, two people unexpectedly reunited in Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you plan to do," Roland indulged for a moment, "returning to the extreme south with the echo, reviving the Aosha clan?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Your Highness!" The iron axe snarled on one knee. "I have already sworn to the Three Gods. The rest of my life will last for you. I was only at that time... I saw Silver Moon at the time." Adults are too excited to control their emotions, please punish!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you?" The prince looked back, "I want to be a tribe Revenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The echo also shouted, "I thought about revenge when I was awakened as a witch, but now I have no such idea." She bit I bite my lip. "Please let me stay here... I have nowhere to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand, stand up," Roland didn't move. "You don't have to be like this. I haven't said anything." He paused for a moment, and the words turned. "In fact, it is not impossible to help you revenge."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The iron axe widened his eyes and seemed unable to believe his ears. The echo did not react much. It can be seen that she did not report any hope for returning to Tieshacheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not now." Roland waved his hand. This is not his whim. In the description of the iron axe to the extreme south, he heard something very interesting - the land is hot and dry, and the environment is weird. Especially the orange fire erupting from the ground can be burned for decades without extinguishing. A large ground fault can often be seen near the orange fire. At the bottom of the fault, the black river is lingering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orange fire or the river, Roland feels that this is not oil? And it's still flowing oil! How important this kind of black liquid is to the industry is not to be said. Half of the modern warfare is caused by it. The rise and fall of oil prices can affect the rise and fall of a group of countries and even change the pattern of the world. If you can intervene in the extreme South by the things of the Aosha clan, maybe he will get a stable source of oil. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Roland now has no time to take into account the disputes in remote places, so I have to leave a primer first, and then go on a set of "from ancient times" drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I get on the throne, I will consider asking for justice for you." Roland stopped and wanted to squat the iron axe. "But today you The behavior violates the first military discipline, shutting you down for two days, and you can reflect on it yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Highness," the iron axe excitedly replied . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The training continues," Roland said to the chief knight. "The next lineup is also your responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The card features should be under the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Brian thought that today's training session will end, but everyone is still sitting in the driving range, and no one is alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Carter left with the prince, the order was made to rest on the spot, not to disband. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s the patrol he’s been waiting for, this situation can’t be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
