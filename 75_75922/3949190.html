			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All stand up, the four princes are down," and did not rest for a quarter of an hour, the iron axe clapped his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna quickly returned to his position, the previous special training made him conditioned to obey orders, almost subconsciously, he has picked up The wooden poles are placed to prepare for the previous stab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince and his party walked up the wall and walked behind the team. Fanna Yuguang noticed that His Highness had slowed down when he passed his position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sighed in his heart, saying that it was ruined in the morning and ruined in the morning. This is really the truth. After finishing the aftermath of the night attack on the castle, I had to come to review the results of the recent training of the militia team. Poor self did not sleep for a night, now it is sleepy again and again. But he can't help but now that the team has been transferred to the stage of training. As the highest commander, long-term lack of appearance will lead to a decline in their sense of existence and the people will become unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... what should I say when I check it out? Roland thought about it, comrades are good, comrades have worked hard? If no one picks up the next half, this slogan will be very embarrassing, or casually pull a personal chat about the family, showing his corporal Li Xian, brushing the reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so planning to shoot a young man who looked pretty strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The training is hard, I feel tired and tired? Is it good to eat three meals?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the experience of the past news, the reaction of the other party should be excited and loudly answering "not tired, very good!" As a result, he was excited and excited. He turned and went straight on one knee and scared Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna feels that he has been taken care of by God, and the prince of the prince actually cares for his training in a friendly tone! Usually don't say the royal family, even ordinary nobles are not willing to say a word to them. He subconsciously imitated the knight's ritual to the prince's palace, and regardless of whether this ritual is appropriate for him, there is only one voice in his heart: in the future, when he returns to the old street, he can count as the number one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being asked to stand up, Fanna’s brain is still in chaos, and he can’t remember how to answer it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, when His Royal Highness asked what opinions or opinions he had about training, when he could come up, Fanner suddenly woke up a lot - this is a good opportunity! If you can let your Highness think that the militia team can't afford the responsibility of guarding the city wall, do you not have to worry about running or staying all day? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is carefully thinking about the wording in his heart, "Respect... Your Highness, the militia team is currently too few. According to the current training queue, wait for the evil beast At the time of the attack, everyone can only defend the range of less than one-third of the wall. You see..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the prince recruits more batches, training Time is afraid that it is too late, Fanna thinks. In addition, the weapons used by these people are also a big expense. It is difficult for Bianyan Town to scrape out the rifles used by 300 people in two months, and even 100 are very reluctant - so they still use wooden poles to train . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the prince can realize this, he may recruit a group of mercenaries from other towns as the main defensive force. At least they can go directly to the battlefield without training, and bring their own weapons and armor, which is relatively high price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought for a moment, nodded. "You said it is good. It is not realistic to rely on a militia team to guard the entire wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna’s heart is happy, Your Highness means... agree with your opinion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the four princes did not say what he was expecting to hear, but called the iron axe to the side. "The evil beast comes in a sense." It’s just a variant of the beast. They don’t have the ability to think?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, Your Royal Highness, the evil beast of the common species is no different from the beast, even Habits are basically the same...but mixed species, I don’t see much, I’m not sure.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s it, although from Chishui River to the foot of the North Slope With nearly 1,800 feet (600 meters) long, we can lure them to attack specific areas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
