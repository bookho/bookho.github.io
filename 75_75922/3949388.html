			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, Wangdu is outside the East Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale is hidden in the fog, quietly watching the group of ragged refugees. Under the echo of the echo, they were summoned in waves, followed by Cavalier Brian slowly moving to the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they don’t have to walk through the edge of the camps like the previous two days, and take the crowd away. A large number of escaping people have let the rest of the people notice this. As long as a wave of people is pulled from the edge, there will be people coming over. The guards on the wall of the city noticed what happened at the foot of the wall, but for them, those who escaped the stinking smell quickly rushed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole plan is progressing very smoothly. There are few fugitives in Dongcheng District, and the people in the North Gate are taking the initiative to move closer to this side. Before, everyone can sail smoothly by boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone is busy, only she seems to be more leisurely - the echo is surrounded by the "mercenary" who is responsible for the reception, Lily is the first Under the protection of the heavy army, the purified water was created, and its own escort work seemed redundant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when the "mercenary" spreads to carry a seriously ill patient who cannot move, she needs to be vigilant. At this moment, the nightingale saw the echo looking up at the magnificent Dongcheng Gate and sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" She went up and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, I just have some emotions," the echoed expression looked a little sad. "Before being sold to Wangdu, I suffered a lot of pain along the way. I thought that the Grey Fortress was so cold to me because of the identity of the alien sand people. Now it seems that they are equally ruthless to their own people, and there is not much difference between those of Tiesha City."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that the echo was bought and sold as a slave, the nightingale didn’t know how to comfort her, and finally had to pat her shoulder. “But not everyone is like this, there are many good-hearted people, like Sisters of the co-sponsors, such as...His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you say... Can Your Highness really stop the dispute?" Echo whispered, "Whether it is Are the mainland kingdoms, sand people, fjords, ordinary people and witches able to live together freely and peacefully without having to fight each other?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If yes If you are His Royal Highness, I think he can," the nightingale replied with a positive tone. "No. Some strange machines and amazingly powerful artillery give me this feeling, but he himself... I always feel that my Highness is not the same kind of person as us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He certainly is not a class with us. He is the prince of the Grey Fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it has nothing to do with identity," she shook her head. "I can't say it." It’s just intuition that this difference of feeling comes from. It’s only a man like His Royal Highness who can make so many bizarre theories... even the power of the witch, he wants to study it over and over again. I don’t think it’s different from others. Anyway, no matter how amazing things he creates, I won’t be surprised.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You really want him I have confidence," echoed and laughed. The sadness on his face suddenly faded a lot. "I hope that when that day comes, I can return to the extreme south."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence? From some aspect, but from a certain aspect... she is completely uncertain. The nightingale couldn't help but look to the west. When he didn't know what he was doing, what was he doing? Is busy with those drawings and strange machinery, or with Anna... She swayed her head and spread the distractions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, after the end of the day, I will be able to return to Bianbu Town. I will think about it at night, and I will ask him directly. Anyway, he can't lie in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning also slowly landed when he returned to the camp at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They patrolled the air with the big sun these days, which is really the hardest one in the team. Especially in order to conceal the body shape, the lightning has to put on a special "sky camouflage" jacket made by Soroya, and the body is wrapped tightly, even the hair is covered. This piece of clothing, which was given a strange name by His Royal Highness Roland, is obviously not designed for aesthetics. It is painted with a pattern of light blue and gray and white. It is almost integrated with the background when flying in the air. It is difficult to look at it without looking at it. Discover her existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
