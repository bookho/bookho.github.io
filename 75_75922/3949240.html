			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of training will last for two to three hours every day. After he finishes, he will return to the city wall and continue to do his old business. The guys in the same dormitory signed up for the firearms team, and now they are carrying new guns and standing behind them to show off. If it is not a discipline that requires no fight, Fanna can't wait to sew his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also saw something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the folks who joined the firearms train for a few days? I began to temper my shooting skills in the battle with the evil beast, and the artillery team? I didn’t even shoot a shell. Moreover, it is impossible for the heavy artillery to be transported to the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the top of the wall, the two people standing side by side almost filled the aisle, usually everyone used to run on the slope inside the wall, even if it is steep It is better than hindering teammates to do the javelin. As for the artillery... The two wheels are wider than the top of the wall, and the shooting is still downwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could it be that this thing is not used to deal with evil beasts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next exercise confirms Fanna’s conjecture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four artillery teams were brought to the river by the iron axe. He found that when I did not know when there was a huge "boat" in the Chishui River! No... He is not sure if this is a ship. The outer casing looks just like the stone that builds the city wall. It is wide and short. Except for the two bare masts, where is the ship? For this reason, the team of Fanner also argued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a floating bridge," the first to decide is the pomelo peel. He used to go to the long-song fortress with the sailing boat, often boasting I know a lot, "The deck with a few feet wide is obviously for stability! I saw it in the south. If it is a ship, how can it move without the wind? In the past, the river had made a lot of water, and the fortress was ten." The wooden bridges of the past few years have been washed away. The people in the city are replaced by pontoons. A bunch of wide planks are nailed to the boat, and then the iron ropes are connected in a row. How to get there is how stable!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The farthest place I have ever been is the long-song fortress, and I’m still going south," Rodney said with a smile. "If you want to pontoon, you need to build two masts, for fear that you won’t be blown away by the wind?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you look at the end, isn't the steering wheel placed horizontally? The pontoon can't use this." Nelson helps, their two brothers are always a nostril Exhausted, "In addition, the arrangement of the middle wooden frame seems to be a shed, but it has not yet been completed. This A boat, there is no doubt "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; in the end it is not the Savannah little interest in the ship, he only cares about the next training content. The answer was quickly revealed, and the iron axe asked them to catch the horses dragging the guns to the township number—yes, the name of the ship, or the name of the prince himself. After listening to the introduction of the iron axe, the pomelo skin suddenly stiffened, and the two brothers were proud of it - then attached the artillery wheel to the reserved blocking rod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two groups of blocking rods, four in each group, located on the centerline of the deck, arranged one after the other. Obviously you can load two guns at a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Vanner thinks, this is sure, they are not dealing with evil beasts - Chishui River flows from north to south, and in the hidden forest There are no such spacious rivers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first time on the deck, Vanner immediately felt its outstanding stability. The river flows through the hull, and the stone ship does not move as if it is standing on the ground. Only when the horse is caught up will you feel a little swing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also noticed that whenever a group of artillery completes a round-trip practice, the iron axe will record the time. Linking to the blocking bar on the deck, it seems that only two groups of the four teams can come in handy. When Fanner secretly told the news to the group members, everyone immediately took advantage of it, and each step used 10% of the effort. If you can't choose to be kicked back to the pike team, it's still a small matter to face the face, and the salary increase is gone, but it's a big deal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the seventh day, Fanner finally ushered in the long-awaited live-fire training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this day, His Royal Highness also visited the scene and watched the artillery practice. The four groups of people all had their chests high, and they walked up to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because everyone who has filled the ammunition has been quite familiar with it, the first shot was quickly started by the Fanner team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
