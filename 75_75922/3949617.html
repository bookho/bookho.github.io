			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representing the administrative integration plan, Roland took a few cups of tea and waited for everyone to digest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintaining the daily operations of a region requires a large number of people. Before the literacy rate is raised, it is inevitable to pull the nobility into it. After all, most of them have received primary education. Management is also a little involved. If there is outstanding performance, he does not mind to put it outside, to manage a city, or even a place, similar to the mayor, governor and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, Roland began to explain the next question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to fight crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his "new order" vision, there is no black street organization in the city, and everyone can find a job that can support themselves without having to To plunder others. If it is a highly developed modern city, he is not sure of this. The saturation of the population and the bottom positions will lead to a large number of unemployed people; but in the West, plus the long song fortress and the entire suburbs are only sixty-seven thousand People, infrastructure is still a blank, as long as they are willing to work, they simply do not work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much do you know about mice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean...Black Street Mouse? "Ryan Meade coughed twice. "I have dealt with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of dealing?" Roland asked with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Ryan seems to be a little embarrassed. "I used to be the leader of the fire gang, and competed with several other mouse gangs to grab the site." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey," a few people at the scene couldn’t help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was also amazed for a moment, the second son of an Earl’s family, would actually go to be a mouse? And the fire help... This name is too unconventional. He began to wonder if this person was really the birth of Earl Meade? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, this is actually the case," Pedro explained. "A few years ago, the Black Street in the Docklands was very rampant, with civilians almost every day. The patrol team was stunned and the patrol turned a blind eye. Sir Rennes couldn’t stand it, and he took his own guards and went to the slum area to draw a group of people and drove the rats from the dock area out of the site. He also wrote the daily battles as a letter to me who was far away from the king. He said in the letter that this is a great battle, no less than fighting the evil spirits, so I think..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perro, don't say it," Ryan accidentally revealed the horrible color. "At the time, I was just bored, just have some fun to pass the time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case, this is probably a "feat" made by a nobleman who is keen on the knight game in the second period. Roland thinks that the elk is fighting for childhood hobbies. Zi, there is nothing more to do with the feeling of being followed by a group of people. , And although not raised armies, but two sets of people fight if momentum is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about this gang now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I don't know," Ryan Touch After touching the head, "Since joining the Hermes defense line and fighting the real evil beast, I have never contacted the group again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Nod, "In fact, I intend to eradicate all the rats that are active in the fortress, so that every civilian can have a safe life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I bluntly said, "Ryan hesitated. "I can't do this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" He frowned. "I have the first army in my hand." Isn't the mouse more difficult than the noble knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so," the other seems to be cautious in choosing words, "they are weak and timid, lacking weapons and armor." I don’t know how to fight together. In the face of the Cavaliers, they are simply vulnerable. But... If you follow the practices of the rebels, if you become a mouse to clean them, I’m afraid that There will be no more civilians left in the fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
