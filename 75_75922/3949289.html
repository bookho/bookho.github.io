			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the room, Anna threw a bunch of green flames into a large wooden bucket full of water, and in a short while the water surface ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She undressed and walked into the bucket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the witches want to clean their bodies, they will come to Anna to help with the boiling water - after all, getting hot water from the kitchen is a very troublesome thing. After seeing this incident, His Royal Highness was quite surprised. It seemed that it was difficult to accept the repeated use of bath water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that Anna feels a little funny here. People in civilians are hard to clean their bodies once a month. It is really common to use the water repeatedly. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t even notice how much improved the appearance of the witches that he accepted. Anna shook her head, and Roland Wimbledon’s Highness seemed to be versatile, and in some places it was awkward. The story that she read from the book, shouldn't the princes participate in various banquets and social gatherings from an early age, and walk in the flowers? You can learn without sin, you can be timid, but at least good at communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this feeling unexpectedly reassures her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of knowledge in her head that is amazing to her, such as iron machines that run on steam, such as counting stones on the surface. There is also today's course - the world is made up of countless tiny balls, they are so tiny that they need to be magnified ten million times to be seen by the naked eye. Because of this, they are everywhere, whether it is solid, gas or liquid, whether it is human, flower or stone, it is basically a look like it is broken down to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbelievable, Anna thought, how did His Royal Highness know this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the body was wiped, she dried the water droplets on her body. Put on your clothes and sit back at your desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The textbook written by Roland is in the center of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a period of time in the book of Illusion. Anna borrowed this textbook from the book and wanted to watch it for a while before going to bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book starts with the common phenomena in life, like peeling onions, step by step, and some places are accompanied by vivid and interesting pictures. Unexpected novelty made her addicted to it, and Anna found it difficult to stop after she opened the first page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the previous content is still relatively simple, and the latter is more and more difficult to understand, such as the temperature section, cold and hot are small ball active Performance, the higher the energy obtained, the more active the ball, the hotter the macro. If your Highness is right, then your own green flame is also a pulsating ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candle gradually burned to the bottom as time passed, and the flame swayed twice and went out. At this moment, the book of illusion also happened to be in the time limit. The pages and writings gradually became transparent, and then disappeared without a trace. The darkness swallowed up the room until a green flame bloomed from Anna's fingertips, dispelling the night that poured into the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the empty desktop, she was a little lost in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising the right hand, the magical fire of Yubi is like a cluster of fluorescent light, standing still at the fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly wants to give it a try. If everything is made up of small balls, can it also become as small as a small ball? Anna closed her eyes and conceived it as a result of the accumulation of countless particles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame began to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It changes from a drop of water-like shape to a thin line, getting thinner and longer, and finally like a hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna felt this change, not far enough, she thought, the hair is still much bigger for the ball. It can also be made finer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my heart, although I thought so, it seems that the green flame is hard to change any more. The light of the flame body becomes dim, and the slender green light trembles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be no use of stacking, but concatenation... Your Highness has a fixed chain between the balls, perhaps you should reshape it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
