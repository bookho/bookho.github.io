			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a wonderful showdown." Hillvi couldn’t help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true." Tilly raised her mouth and looked at the big housekeeper with a sly look - even the careless Camilla was attentive at the last moment. Up, the eyes have not been deviated from the two fighting wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second machine took advantage of the upper hand to get rid of the tail bite, the ending was already doomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this point, the outcome is no longer important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw what she wanted to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the case of a multi-pair, the number of dominant parties has a great advantage. They can allocate height and speed more leniently until they push their opponent into desperation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this number does not simply refer to the sum of the forces invested by both parties. Then, as you can imagine, you can know that through maneuvering and transformation grouping, even if you are generally at a disadvantage, you can get more opportunities in the local area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the goal is a more flexible beast, it will undoubtedly be more important to cooperate with the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, she also noticed that the winner in the high place during the battle is more likely to win. If the enemy can be dragged into the fight, then the formation will be initiated by the high-altitude formation. An ambush may be the most ideal start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how many people are suitable for a team, how to change the formation when approaching the crossfire, this will be her next step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Tilly also knows that such training is always a contest between the two wings. To really determine the content of the next part of the Flight Manual, Go to the actual battlefield to check it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s gratifying to me that the growth rate of these trainees is even better than expected. As the progress goes on, until the “Tianhuo” is officially produced, the empty knight will I can go to the wolf heart and Yong Dong to try my hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, she will not be absent from this battle of revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unicorn only exists as a trainer. The new car that my brother promised should be already in production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the training, simply go to the castle to remind him to hurry up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last aircraft also landed steadily at the airport. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it was the student team or the trainee squad, there was a burst of applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now I know why you have to divide them into so bright sides," Hillvi sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I did have this plan, I didn't expect the effect to be so good. I thought it would take at least ten days and a half to see this scene." Li smiled and waved her hand to the eagle face and handed a new list to the other party. "Since all are back, let the next round of students prepare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Waiting for me for a while... She looks to the north, and I will soon be able to pay for the blood of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "呜 ————————————"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long horn outside the porthole, which means there is a boat meeting in front. Since entering the gray castle territory, similar sounds have been frequent, and Manfred can hear it almost every half hour. Now, the interval is almost shortened to half a quarter of an hour or even shorter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has never heard of it in the past, the Grey Fort is a developed country. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the general impression of the wolf-hearted aristocracy, although the kingdom is large, it can not be said to be a material blog, probably with the wolf heart. On the degree of richness, it is still the most eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But think about it is normal, the news can be very different from one village to another, let alone across two kingdoms. After all, the other side has defeated the church, and this is enough to prove that the king is extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just don’t know how long it will take to reach the legendary Winterless City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred thought of it, yawning a little boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sea journey is easier than he imagined - the ship arrived at the northern port of the morning and did not run non-stop to the next port, but will be crowded The cabin was sorted out, and people with signs of serious seasickness changed their way to the road, and the rest gave plenty of rest. The Chenxi people even set up a large temporary shelter in the dock area, which is completely ready-made, and the degree of cooperation with the gray fort is seamless. If it was not a flag flying on the wall, he almost thought that this was the territory of the king of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously in order to transfer them, the two countries reached an agreement... that is, I don’t know how much the price that Roland Wimbledon paid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blessing of this initiative, the bruises on his body are very fast, basically healed in almost a week, the magical pills that the two women gave him. Have not used it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know what they are doing now... Manfred touched the ball that was wrapped up in his arms, and the two men could not help but appear in their minds. Although they were quite embarrassed at the time and their bodies were dirty, he could still capture a bright color from the dry hair of the other side. If you take care of it, you should not be worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the two can reach smoothly, he thought, if they can get rid of the slave status, they can probably cut off the gloomy past and usher in a new life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Manfred heard a weird crow, as if something had passed over his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a messy footstep in the cabin above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Noisy..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What guys are doing? I can’t Do people sleep well?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone complained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred was in the heart, he rolled over and climbed out of the bed, looking out from the porthole probe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he did not misunderstand, the whereabouts of those people’s footsteps are basically the same as the humming sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outside is still a blue sky and an innocent sea, seemingly unchanged, except for a few big birds chasing and playing...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, what bird is that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred blinked and could hardly believe what he saw - when the "bird" was perpendicular to the sea, it was ribbed The horned straight wings and tail are not like normal creatures! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they fly over the ship again, he confirms that he is not illusory because he has been suffocating for too long, that thing is really not a living thing, but like The metal is made in general. Even more incredible is that he even vaguely saw people sitting still above! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred opened his mouth and tried to scream, but found that half of the words could not be spit out. How can this happen? Even though it has gradually accepted the existence of the First Army and the steamship, there has been some expectation for the prosperity of the Grey Fortress, but this scene still greatly exceeds his understanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is the kingdom, he actually gave birth to a feeling that the gray castle and the wolf heart are not in the same world... No, not only the wolf heart, it and the eternal Winter and morning are also very different, otherwise he couldn't have heard it before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did it start, other kingdoms have been taken so far? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Manfred’s thoughts were in chaos, the ship blew the horn again, but this time it’s much longer, usually reminding the migration Those are about to rely on Hong Kong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
