			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dungeon of the castle is not as damp and dark as the Bentham Town Prison, probably the Duke does not want to turn his basement into a haunted house, or smell it as soon as you walk down the stairs Disgusting smell. In general, the dungeon is still relatively clean. The decoration grades of different cells are also different, some are empty, some not only bring beds, but also wardrobes, desks and chandeliers. Probably the Duke originally used this as a place to hold certain nobles, and the basic etiquette was still to be guaranteed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also found a special cell in the corner, a large bed occupies half of the room, and the chain is suspended by a chain, but the chain is tied The ironwork is also wrapped in a layer of sheepskin, with a variety of whip hanging on the wall. It seems that the Duke of Ryan has also studied in some aspects. He thought that it is a pity that he would leave here in a few days and he could not try to figure it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xia Lafei. Hermon is the most valuable prisoner and is naturally kept in the best cell. If you don't look at the iron railings on the outside, you think it's a luxurious bedroom. Living with him, there are the princes of the Maple Leaf and the Run Wolf family, the eldest son of the Wild Rose family and the second son of the Elk family. These families, together with the Lion Lion, constitute the six songs of the Long Song Fortress - of course, Ryan One faction has been disintegrated by Roland, and his wife and son are kept next door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the prince appeared in the dungeon, the nobles stood up and waited for them to ask, Roland first said, "Count of Hermon, you can Come out. As for other people, when the ransom is sent, I will naturally let you go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father," Pedro saw the Earl's face rosy and rest assured He glanced at his friend and then looked at Roland. "His Highness, I didn't see the name of the Earl of Elk on the list. If he died on the battlefield, the eldest son of their family should still be in the capital, at home. There is no one who can do the main thing. Can you release Ryan Meade first and let him go back to pay for the ransom? I am willing to guarantee him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The eldest son of the elk family, are you talking about Jacques Meade?" Roland shook his head. "He is back. Not only has he returned, but he has been to the castle yesterday. But... I don't think he intends to pay this ransom." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Rennes dare not stick to the cage "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said that you have not been able to protect your father on the battlefield, you are the executioner who killed Earl Med."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did he say this, killing his father is clearly--" Ryan suddenly closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland doesn’t think, "You want to say that it’s me who kills the count, is that right?" He went to the cage, "Your father is in the demon." Before the month, I sent people to sneak into my castle and wanted to burn the grain. Now I follow the Duke and attack the territory with the big knights. I just counterattack and defeat the aggressors. So I am the murderer? Who should be condemned by the Duke of Ryan and the accomplice, the Earl of Mead? In addition, if it is not the statement of Hills that you know nothing about the burning of food, now you are a dead person."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Ryan couldn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness," Peir asked worriedly. "If no one wants to pay a ransom, would you kill him?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That won't, I have always been kind," Roland snorted. "Probably bring back to Bianbu Town and dig a 20-year mine in the North Slope Mine to redeem it." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the ransom..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being the second son, there is no chance to inherit the title, The price is naturally not comparable to the Earl of Honeysuckle, as long as a thousand worth of supplies." Roland looked at him with interest, "Why, you want to pay him a ransom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What value, a thousand Golden Dragons?" The Earl, who was released by the guards, interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your son will tell you," the prince made a gesture of action. "Let's go, there is nothing to be done here. As for Mede's second son." You don't have to rush for a moment, you can slowly go back and think again.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrian left the dungeon and went to the castle gate, the count suddenly stopped." Dear His Royal Highness, I know that the Duke of Ryan’s act is unforgivable, but... his wife and son are innocent. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
