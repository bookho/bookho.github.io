			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temporary shipyard next to the Chishui River is full of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows that this strange wooden vessel is being built in this wooden shed, its outer shell is like a huge bath made of gray cement - Once the kind of thing has solidified, it is no different from the stone. It is thrown into the water except for a bang, and even a shadow will not be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The craftsmen who came to this work gave it an appropriate name: a bathing boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the day when the first two sample ships were launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowds on the crowd are broadly divided into two categories, one is the new residents who join the border town, they are curious about the news, or unbelievable, hug Look at the fresh before the skeptical mentality, including fishermen and sailors from the east and south. The first class is local residents. They have long been accustomed to the miracles created by His Royal Highness. They also heard about the former "Small Town" and braved the snow to gather here, just to see the prince they worshipped. Your Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kakusim is the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When His Highness posted this news and a new recruitment order on the square bulletin board, he said that he would come here to see it anyway. Vader had no choice but to ask the Carter to take a vacation and accompany him to come here - here is not familiar with life, and the snow is serious, he really does not trust the other person to go to the place where the crowd gathers, if not If you are pushed and crushed with caution, it will be almost unhealable for the elderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too young to look at me, child," the old man waved his hand and motioned that he would not have to be with him. "I have also experienced great winds, albeit older. However, the body is not much worse than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Vader did not take it for granted. "I have already invited it anyway. You said that you are late." I just don't quite understand why you must come to see this stuff? Isn't it a ship?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you said it was made of gray stone Kakusim shook his head. "Will the stone as big as the bath in this year float on the water?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dexin thought, when he chatted with him, he did not know how to talk about the announcement of the square. "Perhaps His Highness is just exaggerating the rhetoric. Is there a part of a wooden boat made of cement?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That would be even more impossible," the old man insisted. "What do you think about this wooden shed?" "Building up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be...more than a month ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Wrong, it’s earlier than when you were recruited as a policeman. When we moved into the inner city of the town, it was still empty!” His beard shook. “It took a month to build a shed. In the first half of the month, the first ship was built?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, what's wrong?" Vader did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not!" Kakusim slammed. "In the name of Poseidon! I have never seen a ship that can be built in half a month." This has nothing to do with the size - as long as it is a sailing boat, it takes more than a month to process the ribs. It needs to wait for the wood to be completely air-dried and then steam-bent. This process is extremely troublesome and cannot be completed in a short time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vader said, "How do you know about shipbuilding...so are you familiar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I used to be a captain and a child. "The old man spits out his breath. "When I was young, I used to carry a lot of goods, walking through the sea breeze and the clear water port, and went to the morning sun and the fjord islands. Later, because Something...falls to this point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You never told me about this before." He widened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You never asked, child." Kakusim shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Vader turned his gaze to the shipyard. "So what you are really curious about is the skill of a sailboat in half a month. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
