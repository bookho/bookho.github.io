			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the book was retired, only him and Anna were left in the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland spreads a half-written textbook, intends to complete it, and mentions the quill, but has not fallen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that he always looked at Anna unconsciously, as if his eyes were attracted by her figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" The latter also noticed his gaze, put down the parts in his hand, and looked up and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, nothing." Roland shook his head slightly. "If you feel bored here, let's go to the backyard of the North Hill." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swears, "Not at all boring, I can do the work at hand here, and most importantly, as long as you stay with me, where? It’s all the same.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of slightly shy words, and only she can take it for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Roland smiled and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that Anna will not say something that is against the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first witch to come to the world, Roland has a deep understanding of each other's minds - apart from discussing academic issues and whispers between beds, In some cases, Anna always has a quiet and calm appearance, especially when she is focused on business. But he didn't feel dull at all, and speechlessness was also an exchange for both of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially occasional eye contact has revealed the meaning of each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland simply put down the quill, and he calmly appreciates the serious appearance of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her silhouette is a beautiful landscape at any time - the flax-colored hair ends are much longer, and she is about to cover her white neck, blue The color of the eyelids is still as clear as a lake. A fluffy buff sweater is set on the body, and the comfortable black flannel straight pants are youthful and lively. This set of modern clothing is naturally from his handwriting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to work in the office, Anna has previously cut the precisely adjusted proportion of the metal ingot into a palm-sized cube, then only the person to the castle Then use black fire for processing. When she saw a piece of metal ingot quickly turning into a full-page part under the black fire, Roland couldn't help but admire it. In a sense, the skills and processing level she showed was the same as art. different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and these seemingly inconspicuous small parts will eventually be sent to the factory, becoming a vital part of many machines or weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy to do this. He knows that the length and width of the black fire are controlled by magic, and summoning multiple black fires from different It is more difficult to cut the angle than to write different content at the same time, and the degree of spiritual cohesion is extremely high. I can devote myself to this job day after day, and I am afraid that only Anna’s serious character can be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the girl who originally practiced the flames in the castle garden, everything has changed a lot, as if nothing has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, one day passed quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When night falls, Roland is just sleeping, and the other world just woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He yawned and looked up at the desk calendar on the bedside low cabinet . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is pointing to Saturday, October 14. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the time lapse of the dream world is much faster than the real world, he does not enter the world every night. As long as you don't dream, the time here is still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the living room, the table has been set for breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the holiday, adults have more nightlife and sleep late," he walked into the bathroom and picked up the cup and toothbrush. "Are you going to go out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If I don't go out, I have to write homework!" Xiaotoutou replied, and then muttered like a self-talk. "What night life, obviously back earlier than me, I know that there is no friend, but Unhappy uncle who has no career..." The voice is not big, but it just happens to let him hear it, obviously it is the intention of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland almost got caught in the mouthwash, before the uncle was already too much, and now it has become an uncle? He looked at the mirror, and its appearance is not much different from the real world. How can it be twenty-three or four years old? Even if the vest shorts are so cold, it is not so unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can only be attributed to the child’s vision is too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided not to go with a yellow-haired hoe, "I will open the door for me, I will go out for a trip, I will not bring the key."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his washing, Jieluo has finished breakfast and returned to his room. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sat down slowly at the table and picked up the remote to turn on the TV. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the day he agreed to meet with Garcia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several months of tossing, the professional textbooks and materials that can be bought have been collected and piled up in his bedroom, and then just copy it in the past. However, the plan to explore memory debris has hit the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one in the soul building is willing to rent a house easily, so far only succeeded twice, the fragment of the memory is not worth anything. Content. When I think that there are more than 2,000 households in this building, it is difficult to provide such a large amount of money by selling armor alone. After all, he can't sell the armor as a real antique goods, so the possibility of attracting the police is no more direct than him. The chances of forcing a search into someone else's home are much lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, there are two more reliable ways: either increase the source of income or expand your fame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can be as famous as Garcia in the Block District, it will be much easier to rent or persuade people to move away; or to earn enough money to It is also a good way to buy the entire package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the point, the most likely means of achieving it now is to join the martial arts association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard Garcia said that as long as he participates in the task of hunting and killing the demon, there will be a generous reward, and if the powerful martial artist is willing to appear on the stage, the association will It will be fully supported. When she mentioned the reward, her expression was quite disdainful, as if they were doing everything to protect human beings from the devil, not for money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland expressed admiration for this righteousness and asked in detail about the specific rules of honoraria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his own right, he is not willing to pay attention to this responsibility and dedication, but his actions are similar to the weird organizations behind the conspiracy planners, not to mention the whites. Work. If it is not a few months of trying to explore progress, he will not decide to join the martial arts association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is ten o'clock, he puts on a set of clothes and is out of the door - although the agreed place is in room 0827, it is good to submit a formal application to the association. Naturally, it should not be too casual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but just waiting for him to go out of two steps, suddenly there was a tender scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was sent out by Jieluo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned, just turned back and saw Xiaotou’s face panicked and ran out of the apartment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter, there is a mouse?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a sudden increase in the house and the house. "Jie Luo pointed at the door and stuttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
