			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang En felt that he was unlucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is just an ordinary businessman, running for the profit of the past and between Hermès and Hermes And flannel is sold to the church, and brings back some talisman or statues that have been infused with holy water. This business is highly competitive, and he has also gained a foothold in the two places after nearly ten years of hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some money in hand, he wanted to expand his business, so he bought a house with a warehouse outside the new holy city to store the goods. When I was waiting for a big deal, I didn’t expect the situation in the north to turn sharply. First, there was a fierce conflict between the new king of the Grey Fort and the church. The demand for faith like the talisman plummeted, and he had to return empty. Almost one-fifth of the loss is lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as long as the fur business can still be done, it will not be lost, and the conflict will intensify, and the price of fur will rise. At that time, he believed that it was a matter of time before the church won. As a frequent visitor to the Holy City, he naturally knew how strong the church had. The knight who can walk in the kingdom, put it in Hermes, I am afraid that it is better than a trial warrior trained through strict training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, surprisingly, the church not only lost, but also lost. His business was also declared to be completely shut down, and the price was reduced by 30%. Until the order of the holy city collapsed and the warehouse of the inventory was looted, Dunn realized that it had become a dangerous place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, since I heard the news that the cathedral collapsed overnight, he felt that it was not good, but the luck of the heart always made him reluctant to lose It’s a good family business that is not easy to accumulate. The news that the morning army appeared under the hills of Hermes became the last straw that crushed him. The purpose of the group of people here is almost self-evident, and it is undoubtedly the wealth accumulated over the centuries. However, once you win the red eye, don't talk about fur, I am afraid that even his life will be lost here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After making a heart-to-heart decision, Dunn followed many merchants all the way to the south. After several days of stagnation, he finally safely withdrew to the gray fort. The soldiers stationed at the border did not bother them. They simply took a cross-examination and took them to a specially sheltered camp. Two days later, the team of the Duke of the Northland took them back to the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang Enyuan thought that this nightmare has finally come to an end. Although the business has disappeared in a few years, he is still alive, there is still a place in the city. The sheltered house, wife and children are still waiting for him, unlike his old rival, "The Ghost" Sokas, who died directly on the way to escape. Thinking of this, he felt a lot better in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a day, this sense of relief disappeared instantly without a trace - the two new king’s fighters found him and took him out Camp. He tried to give the couple a pair of silver wolves. When they wanted to find out what was going on, they were rejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it difficult for the other party to want to go through the plucking? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teng En couldn’t help but hold the purse in his arms. This is his last property. If he is robbed, it will not survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but don't you? He did not have the courage, and the murderous army that could beat the church was not something he could refuse. If you are annoyed with this group of killing gods, the end is only fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking around, Dunn couldn’t help but mourn, why is he so unlucky? So many businessmen, but they have chosen themselves? Was it because he threw the talisman and statue that could not be sold into the ravine, and was cursed by the gods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This desperate mood made his heart linger, and he didn’t come back quickly until a commander who claimed to be the deputy battalion commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, what... Trail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party did not get angry, but calmly Re-requested once, "I have a soldier who said that you know a small road that can go directly to the foot of Mount Hermes without going through the new holy city, is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's the one you told me - some merchants often use it to smuggle some high-value goods, and you follow them a few times," added another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is the end of the matter, and regret is useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, there is such a way, the locals call it a ladder in the clouds," Dunn replied with a hard scalp, "only after the annual snowing It will appear, it will not pass when it is foggy or raining, and it is said that there are several exits, but I only know the one that goes to the direction of the morning light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok," the leader nodded. "You take my people to go and take two trips. If you can pass, I will reward you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't dare "Adult!" Dunn immediately slammed. "How dare you want your reward, just hope that you can let me go home after the trip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Unfortunately, this doesn't work." The other party's words suddenly made his heart cool. "In order to ensure that there are no accidents, you must follow us in the next few days until the mission is completed."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but an adult--" Tang En’s words have not been finished, and five golden dragons are thrown in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a deposit, and there are five after the event," the leader interrupted. "You should be clear that in most places in the Grey Fort, ten golden dragons can What kind of things to buy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can buy a life, he swallowed, after so many years of business, the liquidity in his arms is not More than 30 gold dragons. The meaning of the other party is undoubtedly revealed - this is the purchase of life money, it is impossible to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...will you let me go?" Although it didn't make sense to know the question, he couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, as long as you do your best to do the guide work, I will send someone to safely send you back to the Everlasting City. You can rest assured." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twen’s suffering from leaving the camp, he found that he was accompanying him. Young nails, and a very old veteran. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can hurt me," he smiled bitterly. Judging from the look of the two, this matter should be just a coincidence, not a deliberate frame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can this be harmful to you?" The nail frowned. "Ten Golden Dragon is not a small amount. If you don't have a bad heart, don't worry." "I have any danger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, the head is still very reliable, he said that he will put it when you put it." The old soldier interjected, "Again, let's take ten golden dragons with a road. It's too late for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call me uncle Sang. You will be excused from the honor. If you want to use it, you will also say to the nail. He is the squad leader, which is higher than me." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, is that true?" Dunn couldn't help but feel awkward. He always thought that this young boy was just a bottom soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the previous name," the nails waved their hands in disapproval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The two can tell me what your deputy battalion commander is... What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We want to bypass the Hermes Plateau and stop the attack of the Morning Army under the Old Holy City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Squad leader!" Uncle reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, anyway, he will stay with us all these days. Properly revealing some information will also make him less thinking, which will help us complete the task." As long as he makes a slight change, I will kill him for the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nails made Dunn shudder, but the other half of the sentence Unbelievable--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop the morning army?" He widened his eyes in surprise. "This is impossible! The path is only two people wide, and some There is a collapse in the place, and it will fall into the cliff with a little carelessness. Even if you go from early to late, you will pass hundreds of people in a week. What do you guys use to resist the knights? Not to mention the church and possibly from behind. Initiate an attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
