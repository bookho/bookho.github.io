			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland and the witches ate into the castle hall when they had lunch and were ready to go back to the room to take a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, the civilians from the East have arrived at the dock!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So fast?” It seems that Tassa’s efficiency is quite high. He is pleased to think that there is no loss in the patrol team and black and white. But looking at the chief knight's sweaty appearance and tight brows, Roland felt a little wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the people on board have got a strange illness, Carter quickly described the patient's characteristics. "At the beginning, there were still a few people. Now it has spread to two or three ships, and even the soldiers of the First Army are infected!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patient has dark spots and can also be infected with each other? It sounds like a plague, the famous Black Death. But the plague bacillus can't make people's blood change color, let alone crack the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland's brow wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of Lily for the first time, but the ability of the other party can deal with this unheard-of-infectious disease, he is not sure, if it can not be cured, let her It is troublesome to get infected. He must make a careful decision, can listen to Carter's description, these people can't last long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, at least block the scene first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Roland ordered the Carter to "lead the first army to pull out the guard zone outside the dock, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. They: I will be there soon, Miss Nanava is already on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It's tricky?" asked the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not clear, the key depends on Lily's ability," he said, "Call all the members of the Witch Alliance. You can't sleep at noon today. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has considered all the way and has verified the effectiveness of Lily's ability. Previously, it must be kept separate from the patient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, her freshness is a summoning type that works without touching the target - this distance is the same as most witches, close to five Around the meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he recruited two carpenters and quickly set up a rectangular box-type room with the help of Anna. There is a partition in the center of the room, and a small glass window is embedded in the upper end to see the opposite scene through the window. Below the partition is a flexible curtain drawn by Soroya, with two small holes in the symmetry, allowing Lily to reach out. The soft sky-colored curtain will tightly wrap the little girl's hand, thus isolating the air circulation on both sides. Just wash your hands with alcohol and you should be able to stop the infection. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order of the terminal is controlled by more than 100 First Army soldiers on board, and it is possible to maintain discipline under the terrorist infectious disease. It is not that they will be strong. But most of the soldiers believe that Miss Angela, like an angel, will surely make them heal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the box is ready, a soldier who can walk on his own and black spots only appear on his arms is selected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked into the room as instructed, standing still, Lily stretched his hand over the partition and exerted his ability. Roland stood by her side and observed the situation of the other through the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The influence of magic is silent, the little girl nods and gestures, he asks, "How do you feel now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness Prince?" The soldier heard Roland's voice, excitedly raised his hand and saluted him, then squatted in place. "Oh, I feel the strength is restored. Scorpio, My Royal Highness, I feel much better!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also saw it - the dark spots on his hands are rapidly fading, which is definitely not a symptom of the plague. If you remember correctly, the black spots of the latter come from concurrent sepsis and high fever. Even after the plague bacillus is killed, these dark spots will take a long time to subside, and Lily has no ability to recover the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you have recovered, just call other soldiers. Enter ten people at a time. If you have any symptoms, you should come in and treat them once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes! Your Highness," the soldier took a moment and then prayed again. "Thank you, Miss Nana."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not Nana, this time It’s Miss Lily who saved your life.” Roland corrected with a smile. “If you are serious enough to have blood bleeding, you need Miss Nanava to heal you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes... is it," he touched his head. "Thank you, Miss Lily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the soldiers left, Lily married the prince. At a glance, "It doesn't matter if you return to Nana's head. I don't need to be thanked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, why did you just stand so straight? ? Roland looked at the shaking horse's double pony tail, couldn't help but reach out and rub her head, and the other party unexpectedly did not show protest, just snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is not a plague, what is the cause of the disease? He walked out of the box and the nightingale immediately leaned over. "His Royal Highness, I just saw a strange phenomenon, the blood flowing out of those people... there are signs of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Roland lived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the fog, it’s like a little star in the night," said the nightingale. "I have never seen such a small magical brilliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unexpected discovery, but anything that is related to magic is not caused by a witch or by a church. It is now at least certain that the disease is not caused by bacteria or viruses in nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know," the prince pondered for a moment. "If that's the case, take some blood to observe it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you may be infected!" She nervously stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured," Roland smiled at her. "Lily's new abilities have completely hampered the disease."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood sample was taken from a civilian who had fallen into a coma. He inserted a piece of black blood stained on the stage to adjust the object distance. As the scene inside the lens becomes clearer – if the symptoms that cause the symptoms are about the size of the bacteria, then you probably won't see anything. But when the focus overlaps with the target, Roland can hardly believe his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the narrow line of sight, several insects with tentacles and fat belly slowly swim in the liquid, and a mucus is ejected from time to time in the tail. Like a slender hair. They are about the size of a single-celled algae, but like the mother of Lily, the body is not transparent, and it is difficult to tell whether it belongs to a single-celled organism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the magic glow of the bug does not affect the ability of the little girl to function. When the blood mixed with the replica is dropped into the sample, the replica Even attack these weird bugs first and turn them into their own kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the First Army soldiers recovered, in order to avoid accidents, Roland ordered all the fugitives entering the box to wear a hood, led by the soldiers. . At the same time, another box room was also built, mainly used for Nana Va to treat those seriously ill patients. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment has continued from noon to evening. When more than 500 people in the ten boats recovered, a burst of cheers broke out in the crowd. Many people stumbled on the ground, shouting for the long live of His Royal Highness, and the sound waves followed by a wave, which could not be calmed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't seem to be happy?" The nightingale blinked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The person who cures the disease is not me, but Lily and Nana, is a witch," Roland shook his head. "It should also be accepted by everyone." They."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, it is not wise to tell the truth to the public before these people have fully accepted the witch. He sighed softly, hoping that one day the witch would stand up in front of the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale seems to understand Roland’s thoughts, and she patted him on the shoulder generously. “You don’t care, you’ve done enough. Besides, this day will come sooner or later, isn't it?" She paused. "Yes, there is a good news forgot to tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
