			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter flight decisions are not an easy task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the empty knights are equipped with wolf fur caps, fluffy scarves and windbreakers, the bare skin on the face can still feel the bitter chill from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the windshield of the Skyfire is located directly in front of it. When the wind changes or the aircraft makes maneuver, the cold wind will be mixed with snowflakes from all directions into the cockpit. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Goode can understand the necessity of this design. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of his head is a huge wing with a narrow line in front. If you want to observe the ground, the only way is to head out of the cockpit. . In fact, this is one of the things he and Finkin do most. The Air Knight is not as he had thought before. When the two sides arrived at the battlefield, they showed their weapons and their skills. If they did not know the enemy’s position in advance, Airborne light is very difficult to find targets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that in the kilometer, the Skyfire is almost the size of an ant, not to mention the figure on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the reason why the biplane needs to be equipped with two people - the two pairs of eyes always look farther than the pair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you find?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and asked backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About an hour ago, the flight team had crossed the wind and the sky. According to the map, if the enemy did not give up, it should be near this area. In order to find the target as quickly as possible, the four planes were centered on the north, and each of them spread out to form a fan-shaped search surface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the standard multi-machine search method specified in the Flight Manual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, as long as there is no deviation from the course, the four planes are enough to cover more than two hundred kilometers, but considering the weather, the aircraft are not too far apart. This also makes the area of ​​the fan shape greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing!" Finkin yelled back at the lookout. "Will the devil have already caught up with the refugees and killed them back?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you should be able to find a large number of bodies!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I Try harder again... pray that this snow should not cover them.” Fingin said, “Man, can you fly low again?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Goode slightly pressed the nose, while sweeping the North Arrow and the altimeter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the key parameter that can only be judged on the Skyfire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a clear reminder in the Flight Manual that you should not over-trust the instrument - "Because of the limited technical capabilities of the arm, the instrument error should be regarded as a normal state." Especially when the climate, altitude and landscape change drastically. Never forget to look out at any time, unless you are willing to be the cornerstone of technological progress - Tilly Wimbledon."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up to three hundred meters, can't be lower. This is not the gray castle west, the plains everywhere -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Before he finished, Finkin interrupted him. "Two degrees to the right! There seems to be movement there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode looks, The heading was adjusted immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the sound of the wind and the roar of the engine, almost no external sound can be heard in the flight, so the movement that the partner said must not mean the sound, but can be seen with the eyes. The change - and in this weather, there is little activity in the wild, then this movement is particularly suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, Goode also captured the vision with the naked eye. On a bumpy hillside, there are many black shadows appearing in the snowy background. They are not scattered. Instead, it constitutes a number of continuous segments, looking far away as if it were scattered in the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is...footprint?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
