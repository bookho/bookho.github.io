			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Core?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod walked over to the instrument and leaned over The metal block that was dismantled. It soon found out that the stuff was thick and thin, from the outer shell of the pit to the hidden structure inside, almost inexhaustible. Just pick up a tube that contains dozens or even hundreds of parts, much more complicated than a musket. "You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The iron bird is flying by it." The mask is sure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, you are the guy who is faster than the Bogle Winged Beast, whose power comes from a pile of dead things?" Frowning, as the Maharaja who once faced the iron bird, it looked very clear - the reason why the thing can fly is not because of the vibration of the wings, but the paddle of the head humming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a sense, it is somewhat similar to a windmill, but the latter is driven by the wind, and it is actively generating wind. It is only the reason why the blade can maintain high-speed rotation for a long time, which is always a problem that the owner of the Scorpio cannot understand. There is absolutely no way for manpower to do this, so it subconsciously attribute it to the magical seal, or other magical system of spontaneous release. Only in this way can the iron bird be able to be male even if no witch is needed. Flying under the control of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the mask tells it that the iron bird is just a pile of dead metal creations? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it incredible? I think so." When it comes to topics of interest, Nasopelle suddenly comes to the spirit, it sticks out one The slender fingers of the roots were rubbed in the iron bucket and then handed over to the Lord of Scorpio. "Do you want to taste it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hekzozo The dark stains on your fingertips are cold and cold. "Do you want to try the taste of broken hands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough...some things have always been experienced Only then can you leave a deeper impression." The other side took back his fingers and put them in his mouth. "Part of it is burnt, but with a little fragrance, this thing is used to contain the flames." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fire can't drive the iron bird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of fire does it look like? - If the burning is strong enough, it can't do this!" The mask retorted, "You have also seen the fire branches used by the bugs. I took it apart and looked at them. The essence of them is burning. It's just because the speed is very fast, it looks like an explosion! Since this force can push the iron shovel out, it should also push the blade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The fire branch explosion is an instant event. If it is as you said, it is necessary to add burning materials to the iron drum, and the speed is more than thousands of times per minute to reach the speed of the blade rotation. This is theoretically It is impossible to realize that it is impossible." The Lord of Heaven and Earth poured cold water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is also a place I haven't figured out yet." Nasopele admitted directly, "so I called these bugs and wanted to hear their views." Who knows that their dullness is comparable to the inferiority of the outside world - I thought that the bugs were deliberately concealed and used some means, and they actually did not know anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp Speaking of here, the masked monarch is excited to dance. "Do you believe it? The makers of this thing, and the worms belong to the same race! The truth in the equipment, nowadays They stood in front of them, but they didn't know about it. They said that this was just a trick of the fallen witch. I was a little more excited when I was excited."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Big, adults..." The nobleman was stunned by Nasopelle, his face suddenly white, and he kept shaking against the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now I can understand that you don't think of humans as bugs. But I have to say that the guys you bring up are still bugs, and The lowest kind!" The mask turned to look at Heikezod. "Right, I heard that the iron bird and the fire branch are all made by the gray castle. Can you catch a few graysmith craftsmen to give me? I am good. I want to see if their brain structure has changed compared to the worm. If it is, it may be good to fuse a human brain..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Haekzold interrupted. "I am not here to listen to you! When you get their inheritance fragments, all your questions will naturally be answered. The key is to win the war. God of God also has I will enter the human territory in a week. I don't want you to add any more trouble to me - to create more symbiosis, is your entire mission, understand? Also, don't touch these - people - classes. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Scorpio took a deep look at it, then grabbed the surviving nobles and turned away from the transformation room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Shimen closed for a long time, Nasopelle shook his head slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You only have this level, Heckzod."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mystery is solution The key to the essence of truth, you are not interested in it." It took a new mask from the robes and slowly covered it on the head of the witch. "Magic is not the whole rule of the world, the battle of the gods is even more No. Even if you pass through the debris to get everything from the defeated, in the end, not everyone can reach the apex. This is why I can create a symbiosis, but you can only run on the battlefield."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't realize the meaning of these metal creations..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Masaked Maharaja turned Gazing at the wreckage of the iron bird, muttering in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human use of the explosion to promote the giant giant, gave it an unprecedented enlightenment, that is the transformation of power - from stable to unstable is very common However, it was the first time I saw it with unstable violent combustion to achieve a stable rotation. From the explosion to the flight, there must be some internal connection during this period, which makes the form of power change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the two are reversible, does it mean that they are essentially the same? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former ethnic group never thought about how the magic is expressed, what is often revealed, what is it... But now, if you want to come, can the magic work? A similar conversion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use the magic of raising the god of God to directly become the power of the explosion, how amazing might it be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to have seen a new road ahead of itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can master this mystery, don't say the Lord of Heaven, even if it is king... but it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge is the most powerful force in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to know... I want to know the mystery of mankind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasperelle raised his head and couldn’t help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the faint laughter behind him, Heckzod disgusted I opened my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults...fortunately you are here!" The aristocrats who were resisting the shoulders were crying and sullen. "Everyone else was opened by the monster on the top of the head." I almost got the next one-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, rest assured, everything is over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It unloaded the nobles, but did not let the other party leave, but grabbed their collar and held the fence over the suspension bridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, the Lord of Heaven and Heaven, what are you going to do?" Looking at the horrible worm slot at the foot, the nobility suddenly panicked, "No... ...no!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod no longer replies, it raises his hand and throws it away, and the surviving aristocrats screamed and fell more than ten meters. The bottom of the hole. In the face of the sudden "food", the inferior body swarmed up and responded to the gift with an excited body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires a stable and controllable workforce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility who saw the test site and the false face is obviously not here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even it feels that Nasopelle is no different from monsters, and don’t mention these humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of letting him go back and crying about what happened to him, it is better to let him close his mouth here forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this will cause some trouble, it is better than not being able to end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
