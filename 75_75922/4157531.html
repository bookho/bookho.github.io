Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing to say," the silence is clearly wary of the king of mankind. "You know very little about the heavens and the sea, even if you say it." I don't understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It used to be the case, but it is different now. The gray castle west is being attacked by evil beasts, and among them there is the figure of heaven and earth. Roland didn't care about its tone, but seriously described the skeleton monster that climbed the land. "This is the first time we have observed it outside the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell him the information he wants to know," Wajilis also sighed. "In any case, it’s better than letting human heritage fragments fall into the hands of the heavens and the sea."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you said this..." Cerroshhi nodded helplessly. "Listen, humans, the things you see are called nest mothers. They are also heaven and earth." Expanding the core of the site. The nest itself is not very competitive, but it can control many of its men to fight for it -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the brain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be described as such, but don't interrupt me next time." Silent, "This The creatures are older than you think, and they may have existed at the beginning of the world—but the long time has had little effect on them, and the changes in shape and ability have been very stable until recently in just a few months... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some explanation, Roland finally understood the uncharacteristics of the Tianhai world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the devil, they will also evolve, but unlike the evolution of power in the usual sense, every change in the heavens and the sea will affect the whole family. For example, the nest is the nest, the blade is the blade, and the individual does not show significant differences before, unlike humans and demons, each individual is relatively independent. Probably for this reason, their evolution is very slow, and it is only a few hundred years before they notice a little difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent big variation proves that this idea is very wrong. No one knows how many times the Tianhai world has evolved in a few months. The only certainty is that their strength has grown dramatically. For example, the Blade Beast, which was previously used by the nesting mother to hunt for food, can be shredded by the madman as long as it is locked in position, but now they have not only increased their size several times, but also have strength, endurance and reaction speed. Greatly improved, the claws filled with magic can even threaten the high-level devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the case of confrontation, high-ranking promoters can easily kill a bladed beast. The problem is that the evolution of the Tianhai world is universal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like when a witch is awakened to be supernatural, the other witches will become the same as above - as long as the number is sufficient, the volume will be very It is easy to bring about qualitative changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil’s reluctantly maintained line of defense is no longer able to withstand the erosion of the heavens and the sea, and countless enemies climb out of the sea, like waves to the battlefield, Wang Had to make a decision to abandon the Blackrock Field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely not good news for Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the devil is really powerless to maintain his territory, then mankind will take on this new pressure - the impact of the Western Development Land is just the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human, I suggest that you immediately transfer the fragments," Silent finally said. "With your strength today, it is difficult to face the forces of the heavens and the sea. Lisi is right, and it is absolutely unacceptable for us to be smashed by the Tianhai world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did not intend to give the pieces to them." Roland shrugged. "In addition... don't you think this evolutionary time is a little coincident?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Wajiri’s legs, "Speak and listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blackstone has been fighting with the Tianhai world, so the judgment of evolution time should not be biased to where - and three Four months ago, it was almost the moment when God made an ambush."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you suspect that the dramatic evolution of the Tianhai world is related to the gods?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of Wakiris gradually dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think so? But the participants in other battles of the gods have almost exchanged with each other." Roland slowly said. The humans and the devils did not say it, and the Yunxiao school period even coexisted together. The underground civilization that has been destroyed has also "connected" to the Witch Federation before the demise. This is the plan for the gods to punished. He believes that the experience of the other side should be similar, which can be seen from the expression of the nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Tianhai is an exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no literature left on them in history. If human beings are rarely involved in the depths of the sea, even the devil has no experience in this area. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, communication is the commonality of civilization, even if they are mutual enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it seems like a silent person outside the tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with this idea, the reason behind the evolution of the Tianhai world is somewhat chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do next?" asked Wakiris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the bottomless world before everything can be recovered." Roland looked at the two. "I hope that you can stop all offensive operations and use the power. In dealing with the Tianhai world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is impossible." The silence of the disaster straightforwardly refused. "It is only your side to say that the gods and the deliberate scams are not. The current Western Army commander is already a mask, and the symbionts are controlled by it. What's more..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's more?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cerroshhi did not answer directly, but for a moment, "I want to talk to Wakiris alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call..." Roland gently vomited, "Okay, but don't forget the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence took the door under the guidance of Wakiris and walked along the aisle of the tube building to one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this perspective, an indescribably grand city is presented in the eyes of Cerro Shahi. The block-like gray high-rises are one after another, and they are not inferior to the tower of the birth, but there are several levels in the number. They stretched out along criss-crossing roads, as if there was never an end, and even God-made gods could not accommodate so many creations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strong impact makes it breathe a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment in the window has made Cerrochhi shocked, but the scene after leaving the room is far beyond its imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s even more incredible that there are so many figures in the city that they are neither like the enchanted people who are being absorbed, nor the non-conscious areas. Dead matter - this is the biggest difference between this place and the rule of the Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder the man would call it "the world." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s all right here." Wajiris stopped his footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This voice also interrupted the thoughts of silence, it forced itself to re-concentrate the spirit, and then carefully sensed it for a while before opening. "There is other magic in the room." The existence exists!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, it is a witch." Wakiris said indifferently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." This reaction is somewhat unexpected by Cerroshhi. "You have already... know?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was waiting for you, I also talked a few words with them - although they still don't like me." The nightmare nodded. "The main purpose of the witch is to protect Roland." But in fact he does not need protection, this is just to make everyone feel relieved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is super-excellent, it is not so in front of the Maharaja Easy, let alone a mortal male? Silence found that the news was as shocking as the scam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
