			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Roland’s plan, the City Hall, the Security Bureau, the First Army and the Witch Alliance are the four major institutions, which constitute the administration on the bright side of the Grey Fort. main body. In addition to the most special security bureaus, the other three agencies should get the cooperation and support from the relevant departments through the approved actions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original intention of this set of rules is undoubtedly to be able to give full play to the power of the whole kingdom. It is difficult to make a mistake when I am sitting down in the house, but the problem is It’s a very difficult thing to get the three parties to agree in a short time. Therefore, when Wendy heard the devil from Luojiakou, the best way she could think of was to issue a warning, a solid city, and a decision-making meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, she is not sure how much trouble this will cause to the City Hall. The breeding wheat fields in the fascinating forest produce hundreds of bags of gold No. 2 seeds every day. They need workers to move to the docks and ship them to the north, south and the newly reclaimed territory. In addition, the collection of wood, mushrooms and fruit from the forest area will be affected, and the animal husbandry in the grassland pasture will also be stagnant. Barov’s rhetoric is not entirely exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the third battle of the gods was opened, a new wall would appear north of the border, including half of the grassland, not only with the existing The city wall forms multiple levels, which can also effectively improve the utilization efficiency of the desperate mountain line and make the ore smelting area and factory in the north of the city safer. Even during the war, resources from the forest and the North Slope Mountains will not be cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this plan is still on paper, and no one expected that the news of the devil will come so early, compared to the losses faced by the financial industry. She must make a more cautious choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil is the basis, mortal, is this difficult to understand?" The light curtain on the wall of the conference room fluctuated, and the sound of Elx’s disdain passed into each Personal mind, "Anything related to the devil can't wait for it. They are not stupid evil beasts. They won't wait until you are ready to attack. I don't think you are really aware of the terrible opponent. It’s a pity that when I saw the mortal king, I thought that you have grown a lot in these hundreds of years.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an ally against the devil, the tower The lama and the sleeping charm naturally also have the qualification to attend the meeting. For Wendy's decision, both leaders Pasha and Tilly Wimbledon expressed their agreement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barov was almost laughed. "I don't know how terrible the devil is, because it didn't appear in front of me. - These guys Can you kill people by air? You keep saying that you must be prepared. I agree with this, but the problem is that even the shadows of the enemy can’t be seen now! There is a witch-controlled forest in the west, and the east is built on the peak of the impasse. In the sentry tower, there is an unobstructed grassland between the two barriers. Any action by the enemy can be detected from a few miles away. Do we need to be cautious to this point?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the task of the city hall is quite quite a concern for His Majesty’s task. Wendy thought that at the last meeting, he was afraid to breathe in front of the monster’s original carrier. Now he dares to The last two sentences are even ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think it is necessary," Ashes said. "In fact, I proposed to Wendy to do this."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? Or is it because of an inexplicable witch's nightmare?" Barov beat the table. "Don't tell me that you believe her - if she really believes, or your relationship So close, she should have been part of the Witch Alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not for this reason, but based on the judgment of facts." Explain, "I used to play with her and know her strength. If it is only one or two mixed species of evil beasts, it will not make her so embarrassed. According to the information currently available, the madman is without the support of the magic stone. The fighting ability and the medium-sized mixed species are similar. Even if Luojia can't win, it can be turned into a wolf shape and easily get rid of the opponent's tracking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want? What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil she met is likely to be Only above, and there are still flying beasts in the sky to track, will make her suffer so seriously." Ashes said one word at a time, "In addition, we also found a map from her, if the writing does not admit mistakes, then it should It was lightning that was left to her - although it was not clear about the specific process between them, one thing is certain, after she left the city without winter, the scope of activities was in the uninhabited wasteland. If there were suddenly such a group of devils in the wilderness, So no matter what they want to make, we have to be wary early."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
