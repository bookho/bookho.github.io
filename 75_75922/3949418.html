			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter also mentions that Tilly is trying to translate the text and would like to see if there is any clue on the side of the co-help club. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland decided to reply to the news of the devil and the holy city of Taqila in a reply, and sent the photos of the photos restored by Soroya, saying It may not help her translation. This kind of information is not suitable for hiding. It is possible to find out the mistakes of more than four hundred years ago, and you can prepare for it earlier. Maybe you can find the weakness of the church - if they have no scruples, they are fundamental. It is not necessary to bury all the history of the past into the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously there are things that they want to avoid being known. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the stone tower in the hidden forest is also best to send people to check it out. The remains of Haifeng County in the east are blocked by the church. The stone islands of the fjord are soaked in the sea all the year round. There is almost nothing left except for a pile of books in the secret room. The depths of the hidden forest are inaccessible, and even the church can't easily reach it. Maybe you can find some useful clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the devil in the lightning report also made him very jealous. This kind of action does not send a witch, but if a witch is sent, any one of them will be unacceptable. . He considered it over and over again, and decided to wait until the military equipped a new generation of firearms, and directly went to the forest with the same witch to deal with the possible devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pressed the uneasiness of his heart down, revealing a stubborn smile. "I understand the things of Tilly, I will reply and explain it to her. Or do the ability test first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, it’s just right to develop your strength as soon as possible in peacetime. When the unavoidable war comes, he will at least Can have the power of a battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test site was chosen outside the town wall to prevent the escape Into the test site, Roland also mobilized the First Army to isolate the surroundings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one to be tested is Lotus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her age is similar to that of the nightingale, with a black short curly hair, and the five senses belong to the Xiaojiabiyu type, which is very moving. The head is not high, only about one meter five, the body is thin, compared to the tall nightingale, it is like a little girl who has not yet fully developed, giving a feeling of weakness. However, her ability is not soft at all. Within five meters, she can easily change the topography of her feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The description on the letter is far less shocking when you see it. In the test, the lotus leaves the land next to it vertically, as if a sky "The column", until it was nearly seven or eight meters, the towering "soil column" collapsed because of structural instability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to her, the looser the ground, the less magic it takes to make a change. But the same, if the geology is too bad, the strength of the built houses and walls is also very low. If the main component of the ground is gravel, it is difficult to create something decent - obviously she can only change the terrain, and can not change the material of the earth. Of course, this problem can be solved by expanding the scope and thickness of growth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also asked her to demonstrate the construction of the house, but the soil in the west is obviously not as tight as the sleeping island. The earth house rising from the ground is in the window and the doorway. When the collapse occurred several times, the wall thickness was increased to about half a meter. After the completion of the house, it is as simple as a cave dwelling, and it can only serve the most basic living function. It is much worse than a brick house with a neat layout and compact structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, the poor caves are better than the wooden shacks that are leaking, at least in the winter, a brazier plus a bandit can make the house Warm and dry. If you can't catch enough brick houses before the demon moon, you can use this house first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final step is a comprehensive test - the ability of the lotus is a typical summoning class, without branching ability, shaping the terrain can be effective within five meters of its own, very It is easily affected by the stone of God's punishment, but the already formed land will not back down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is her magic level?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A group of brown cyclones, the center is very rich, is a very good level in the witch," the nightingale thought, "closer to the leaves." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
