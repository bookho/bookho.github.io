			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two groups crossed the midfield and advanced to the five-kilometer area, the first army position raised the detection balloon and stopped the shelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer also noticed this situation, but it could not understand the intention of human beings, and the floating sphere should play a role of ascending. But in the night, even the objects in front of you can't see it. What is the use of rising high? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fire and rain, it issued an order to accelerate the progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the black shadow crossed the four-kilometer line, the artillery battalion completed the latest round of ammunition preparations and set up a flare launcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the first night attack, no winter city has produced a number of simple lighting equipment - it is essentially no different from mortars Only the parachute was installed at the end of the shell, and the explosives in the head were replaced with a mixture of magnesium and aluminum powder that could continue to burn. The earliest flares could share the launcher with the mortars, but during the test, the brightness and burning time of the small-bore bombs were not ideal, so they were replaced with dedicated large-caliber barrels. Although it is still impossible for the soldiers to achieve the shooting accuracy during the day, it is generally clear that the battlefield environment is no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the First Army never used it in actual combat - this is also the advice of the General Staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the enemy approached the edge of the three-kilometer range, the iron axe could not wait to reach the counterattack order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Fanner yelled after hang up the phone, "lighting bullets, maximum angle, put!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a few soft touches, the night sky suddenly burst into a dazzling array of light, and the orange fireworks dispelled the darkness, re-emphasizing the outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more flares, igniting, falling--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the scope of the scene, it seems that there is a row of "small sun", although they can not turn around the night, but let the stars and the moon lose their luster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge stone pillars, spiders and madmen hiding in the night also showed their stature! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if there is only a small range, it is enough to indicate the target for the artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a round of test firings, intensive shells whizzed to the back of the stone, unlike the previously unintentional shots, this shelling was completely prepared. Come - and the devils who are exposed to the position are obviously stunned. They don't seem to know whether they should move on, or they will flee backward from the area that was suddenly covered by light, and they will be deadlocked at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the deafening explosion covered the enemy’s twisted marching team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osruck looked at the "light balls" that were slowly falling in the sky, The expression of indifference finally showed a change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it understands the significance of human beings raising a floating sphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six months ago they were still unable to do anything about the night attack, they could only passively stay in the camp, but now they have come up with a response and endure this time. Only at this moment. No matter from the means to the heart, you can no longer be a pest without threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such humans... can be called their opponents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must let the king know this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It made a judgment in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Erskuk also strengthened his thoughts and removed the other’s eyes and arms, which is the most important goal at the moment, otherwise the unit may Bringing endless troubles to the pioneering plan of the ethnic group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It moves the line of sight back to the foot--under the bombardment of human fire and rain, the gods and the follow-up forces have become disconnected. According to the original idea, these pillars should be able to advance into the attack range of the tombstone. At that time, the original body of the two wings can be used to launch the assault, so as to restore the disadvantage on the range and maximize the killing efficiency of the troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To destroy those light balls? No... these things are obviously how many humans there are, and there are people in the position who are staring at it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esruck slams the speed and The other's position flies! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After avoiding a series of fires, it fell to a floating sphere and caught the observer as he jumped out of the basket. Neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the frightened human being, Erskuk showed a sly smile and then tore it in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it threw the body down and gave a sharp whistle to the back of the hair! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voice, it is the command of the general attack-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feeling its will The original body made the same roar, they rushed out from the hidden place, and launched the final charge towards the human position! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the earth is boiling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle finally returned to the most familiar way of the First Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of devils emerged from the blind spot, and it seems that the enemy is everywhere. The continually lifted flares illuminated the last three kilometers, and the mortars and heavy machine guns fired almost simultaneously, as if the entire surface had been turned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably both sides are aware of the significance of this decisive battle. Once contacted, there will be no more hands-free. The two forces will collide so suddenly. The plain turned into a bloody ground meat farm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as they climb into the scope of the spear, the madman will not hesitate to cast the spear continuously until the arm is scrapped. Even if the legs are interrupted and the body is broken, they will drag the blue blood to continue to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Army did not take a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine gun team poured out the bullets like water, even if they faced the stone needles from the spider magic, they did not hide. Immediately after the exposed shooter was knocked down, new team members will take over the work of the casualties. The only thing that will stop them is to replace the scrapped barrel for a short while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fierce battle lasted from midnight to dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky was full of white feathers, dozens of beasts also joined the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the dawn of the morning, this is undoubtedly the last chance of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time the pressure on the ground has been greatly reduced, more machine guns raised the muzzle, and together with the high-level team to hold up a tight air defense network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon rushed into the position several times, trying to interrupt the firepower of the line of defense, but they were all forced back by the intensive rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance of victory is leaning to the human side a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At noon, the guns calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha followed the iron axe and others out of the underground command post and slowly came to the front of the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air is still filled with the smell of the nose, but she feels that this taste is unexpectedly charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lush grassland was still in a mess at the moment, and there were craters and corpses everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the enemy ran down the earth and plunged into the mud, while the grass blades and shrubs that passed through reflected a faint blue glow under the sun's rays. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruins of the Takira in the distance are still occupied by the giant skeleton, but Ai Gesha knows that after this battle, the devil has no way to stop the human footsteps. They are only the next step away from retaking the Holy City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
