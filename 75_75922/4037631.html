			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Roland finally figured out what happened in the coma for more than a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church has undoubtedly suffered a heavy blow. The puppet army has almost disappeared from the army, the trial army has been annihilated more than half, and many of the more than 2,000 people who have fled back have already It is a matter of time before the madness of the pill is eroded by the magic. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the disappearance of the Pope, a large number of high-level commanders died in battle. After this battle, the holy city of Hermes is no longer able to touch the gray castle border, or even It’s hard to say that the month of the next demon is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the loss of the First Army is not small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason is that the black sorceress’s raid—any soldier who saw her eyes without wearing the stone of punishment, was affected to varying degrees. Of the more than 700 casualties, 80% were caused by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland’s fall has also greatly shaken the military. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, the iron axe issued an order to withdraw the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, at this time, the function of the City Hall is very complete. Under the concerted efforts, there is no problem. The statement released to the public is that his Majesty was injured in the battle and needs to be rested. The funeral of the soldiers killed in the First Army was also co-chaired by Iron Axe and Barov. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the witches’ narratives, Roland had a great interest in the captured pureness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said, they have no feelings for the church?" He looked at Ai Gesha. "The witch named Isabella is also willing to help us fight." "The devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The vanilla and Maggie were not adopted by the Archbishop, but they were selected from the monastery in order to carry out this mission. This nightingale has been separated. I have confirmed it.” Ai Gesha replied, “It’s Isabella’s very strange. She doesn’t seem to care for anyone, as long as she can defeat the devil. She also said that this is the idea that the last pope instilled in her.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I recommend leaving Isabella temporarily. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she is the pure man who is raised by the church, is our enemy!" The book frowned. "If it wasn't for her, the witch named Jieluo." "You can't hurt your knees at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, Wendy is also raised by the church."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not the same! Wendy has never hurt anyone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isabella also did not directly hurt A witch, her ability can only work on the stone, and the witch rarely takes the initiative to wear the stone," Ai Gesha did not think, "the nightingale confirmed that she did not lie."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is that true?" Roland looked to the other side of the big bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, there was a resentful response from there, "Yeah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The most important thing is her ability," Aegusa continued. "Isabella mentioned that the matte black hole formed by the stone of the gods has a unique tremor pattern, and she can create a kind of The opposite tremor makes the stone effect invalid. Perhaps this is the key to cracking the secret of the demon, I even suspect that she is a natural demon - if you can understand the relationship between the stone and the magic, other witches Maybe it can do the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news caused a breath of inhalation in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most of them, the stone of divine punishment is a shackle that cannot be passed on. Because of the limitations of the god stone, they will be oppressed. The pain of displacing, facing the church and the nobility of the arrest can not do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thoughtfully touched his chin to counteract the tremor? This is just like the characteristics of waves. Isn't the magic spread in the way of waves when it spreads? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No winter city is obviously not only the witch is concerned about his safety, in the afternoon, received the news of Barov, Axe, Carl and other high-level Officials came to the castle one after another. Everyone saw a reassuring look after seeing him, especially the city hall manager, and even groaned with Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he just woke up, he didn’t ask too much about politics, but put the conversation on gossip and appeasement - long time coma let no winter city The insiders are heart-wrenching, and now the most important thing is to inspire people and let everyone know that their king has recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, a rich banquet was held in the castle area, the town hall and the first officer of the army were almost all present, and the table full of food was placed in the yard. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, but he also ordered the hot porridge of a car to be pushed into the square, so that the people of the whole city can participate in this joy. In the middle of the celebration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the feast, Roland returned to his bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night," he screamed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night," he repeated again. "I know you are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still no movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sighed and turned and walked out two steps, reaching out and touching the body of the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is in shape and is preparing to kneel down, he directly lifts her up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;咦, the strength seems to have grown a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it doesn't matter, Roland glanced at her in disgust, not waiting for her to speak, said directly, "I know what you are doing, but this one It’s not your fault, and I’m safe and sound, so don’t blame yourself, understand?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ai Gesha clearly reminded me, but I Still... oh, oh, squat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland hugged her directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his first time to actively embrace the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally Roland prepared a lot of words of comfort and persuasion, but when I got to my lips, I didn’t want to say anything more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows what the other person really needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before being hit by the radiance of the jingle, the nightingale turned his back, and the back of his body was still fresh in his memory - she At that time, I was ready to sacrifice. In the face of such a woman, what more can he ask for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a while," Roland whispered. "I will solve this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Solving... What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't answer, but he knew that the nightingale could understand what he meant - her breathing was the best. prove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent is often an intangible injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he can’t turn a blind eye, he can only put this responsibility on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if this would be a thorny road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a night's sleep all over the body - when the pressure shifted away, her look strengthened again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When people are at a vulnerable moment, all they need is a promise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expectation has meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I am waiting." She wept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
