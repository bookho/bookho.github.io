			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of the entire castle is very serious in the following week. The heads of several departments will open a half-hour meeting every day and report to each other. Happening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, haven't you found the trace of the devil?" Barov took a sip of tea and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if Wendy’s willingness to take all the responsibilities to alleviate the boss’s concerns, or the transfer plan of the Golden No. 2 seed is being realized a little, his look It was much more soothing than the first few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sentinel of the First Army has pushed the cordon to the grassland border, but still found nothing," the head of the defending army succinctly replied, "Further north is a wild land surrounded by jungles. It is difficult to further expand the scope of search without sufficient logistics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mortal's ability is here. So far, don't talk about the devil and the evil beast, even the insect ants living there can easily kill your life." Elsie seems reluctant to let go of any ridicule opportunity, "This task is still handed over to us. The devil's witch is grouped in groups of ten, and has now advanced to the Pearl Lake area within 30 miles of the Fertile Plains, where a small sentinel has been established."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Pearl Lake?" Wendy asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's the place where many nests are marked on the map of the wolf woman - there used to be a densely populated lake, and now it is turning into a swamp." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you be in danger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our experience with the devil is better than you Much richer, a godly witch can cope with three or four madmen at the same time. As long as there are five people accompanying each other, even the devil's small patrol team, they also have full grasp." Els is full of confidence. "Of course, if the wolf girl is really a small patrol, the enemy's big army may not be far from us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will not act alone ?? Barov is curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The demand for red fog is destined to be too far away from the supply point," Pasha explained. "After all, the devil can't be self-sufficient like humans." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So... are you so far away from the Winter City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Unless we set a sentinel every three or four weeks, there will be no winter city around the center like a net, otherwise there is no guarantee that the enemy will not sneak in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if it doesn't make much sense," added another high-level witch, Celine. "Without listening to the support of the seal, when the search team observed the fear of the beast, it was too late to send the news back." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Wendy couldn’t help but sigh in her heart. The complex environment was like an invisible barrier that would compress the sight of the winter city without South of the grassland. The entire northwest is like a mysterious cloud, and all they can do is slowly search for the enemy's clues in this chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia’s news is too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Sylvia, Lightning, McMug, Nightingale, etc. are still there before the embarrassment, even if you want to find out the whole north The situation is estimated to be as long as one or two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ability in such a situation is too weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although you may feel that I am nosy, but Mr. Manager, can you tell me how the city people reacted in recent days?" Tilly suddenly asked. "Does they feel scared or scared?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where," Barov quickly put down the teacup and gave him a gift to the five kings. "Everything in the city is under the control of the City Hall. Recently our clerks have received a lot of inquiries, but the question is mostly where the enemy is, and the first military needs do not need help - that is, they not only I don’t feel flustered, but my fighting spirit is high. Even the efficiency of evening shifts has improved a lot. Please rest assured that no one has ever associated this with the Sleeping Island witch.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
