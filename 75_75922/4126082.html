			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South of the Shahai, the source of Yinchuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian sat in the tent and waited for the news of the front line. On the other hand, it is the patriarch of the mad flame clan, Gulz, the fire, and the Aurora clan, Thuram. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two of them have now become the spokespersons of the Mokins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional battalion commander representing the chieftain, it can be said that the leader who can determine the fate of the sand people has gathered here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind on the desert blew the tarpaulin, but the awning was unusually warm - the sand seemed to be in a huge brazier Above, no matter how cold the surface is, burying your feet in the salt sand can always feel the hot air rushing out, the effect is comparable to the fire and heating of the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The locals even invented the sand bed thing - the ground is cut into a shallow pit that is long and wide, and the salt sand of the white flower is replaced by a sieve. By dividing the fine sand and burying yourself, you can maintain your body temperature to the utmost. And those fine sands are soft to the touch, and even lying on the top is even more comfortable than the pad woven from the linen. If you have a tent on your head, you can have a good winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately it is this geothermal, ruining the vitality of this place. The salt in the sea water is constantly being deposited, turning the desert of about 100 kilometers into a white snow. Not to mention flowers and trees, even sand worms and drug lords are hard to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without an oasis, there is no source of food. A large plain and a dead place are no different. If it is desolate, there is only a black water swamp in the extreme south. Above it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For centuries, Mo Jinren has built several scattered wooden houses at the junction of saline-alkali land to provide salt for those who come from afar. People stayed for a while, but now, the situation has become different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are very calm, young man," Gould suddenly broke the silence. "The angry Tao clan and the boneless clan are the strength of the iron sand city." The top big people, the big chiefs can easily beat them, does not mean that the small tribes can do this too - you are so confident to them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See Someone started, and Thuram added quickly. "In this year, Tiesha City has not been promoted to the six clan by the new tribe. Obviously they have taken all the resources that flow to the city. In the extreme south, as long as there is sufficient The clan will soon be able to recover. Their current strength is only stronger than before you came here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Confidence? No..." Brian shook his head slowly. "I don't have such a thing for them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... why don't you use the troops of the Grand Chief?" Thuram was a little surprised. "You only need to dispatch a hundred people, and then cooperate with the warriors of the flames and the proud sands. Can let this group of arrogant people not dare to step over the small oasis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then? Let the first army cruise forever in the Yinchuan Oasis, serve as the small tribe The caretaker?” Brian looked at him. “Do you think that is what you want to see?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey, this...” Tula Mum is a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the implementation of the large-scale migration plan, the development work on the polar South has also started. In addition to the construction of Daqing Port in the endless Cape, another focus is on The saline-alkali land at the source of Yinchuan. Due to the lack of rivers, it is only necessary to rely on a large amount of manpower and animal power to transport these industrial resources of white flowers out of the desert, and one car is towed to the nearest tributary of the Chishui River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are plenty of conditions for the two cities of Canglongling and Bishuigang to attract enough sand people to join the army of sand-moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In just one year, there were a lot of camps and contacts in the saline-alkali land junction. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep mouth was laid down, fresh water was taken from the Yinchuan dark river flowing underground, used for drinking, and also used for filtration and purification of salt sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple factory building was also established, there was no spewing steam, no machine roar, everything was done by human hands - the whole process was like gold rushing, People gather the wealth scattered among the tens of millions of gravel, recrystallize into pieces, and then transport it to the hinterland of the west, waiting for further processing. This repeated and boring work has become a new melody of saline-alkali land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
