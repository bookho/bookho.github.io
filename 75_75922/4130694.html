			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray Castle, Old King Capital, Inner City Grand Theatre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a warm applause from outside the study, which meant another curtain call for an outstanding performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the reading of Kajin Fez also came to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took off his glasses and rubbed some tired eyes, then closed the script and put it back in the closet at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title on the spine is "Wolf". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, the most convenient scripts in the cabinet are "Witch Story", "New City", "Dawn", etc. These are all left. Before the winter, Mey gave him a gift. Although many people in the troupe thought that this was a naked sarcasm, he took it all down and brought it back to the theater for several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not because the script itself is wonderful – the creator is undoubtedly a newbie, and the arrangement of the scene is very straightforward, basically in the beginning of the story At the stage, but he does not do this, there is no other thing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kajin found himself losing his desire to create. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as he picks up the pen, the picture in the shadow will appear in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, this should have been the stage of the Grand Theatre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not conceive the position of the actor and the setting of the set board, just like after eating honey, it is difficult to satisfy the sweetness of dew. In the shadows, the whole world has become a stage for performances. There is no longer a gap between the audience and the actors. This shocking scene opens a new door for him, but then he refuses. Outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you only look inside, Kajin can’t look back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately speaking, he does not want to re-create, but any thoughts that emerge, will be unconsciously put into the shadows to consider. For example, when the prince first met the princess, the close-up of the smile, the two people gradually pulled away from the bleak background... The idea of ​​such a rush came out, and almost did not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shadows brought him countless things to try, but none of them was related to the theatre story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this contradiction that makes Carkin Fez feel uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when reading the script, will he forget these troubles for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also knows that this can only be used to ease it a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei is not willing to disclose, the Executive Office did not return ... means that no winter city completely closed the door to him, before he found a new channel of understanding, he Know that you will continue to suffer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door of the maid was ringing outside the room. "Master, there are a few letters sent to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kage closes his eyes and leans against the back of the chair. "Put it outside, I will see it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After the drama ended, Roentgen, Aegola and others usually come to the study to discuss the experience and incomprehensibility of the performance, he intends to restore some energy before this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... there is a letter on the letter that marks the royal family of the Grey Fort. You have told us that if it is a letter from No Winter City, it must be I have handed it over to -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waitress’s words have not been finished yet, and Kajin has opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the letter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter was shocked and handed over Stacking the letters, then watching the drama master pick the letter from the royal family, and stuffed other letters back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the letter that King Wimbledon wrote to him! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the other party finally know that the Kajin Troupe has been to no winter, want to offer drama for the throne ceremony? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can contact the king of the gray castle, then the magic shadow is not also falling? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pressed his excitement and spread his letter down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many roses have you received today?" On the way to the study, Ai Gepo joked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten come, no detail," Roentgen shrugged. "In short, it’s less than before. Although I don't care."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If those admirers hear this sentence, their hearts will only be broken in half." Aegpo laughed. "The reduction in quantity is inevitable." His Majesty sent half of the nobles to the mine, and it became the old king capital. The nature of the drama to enjoy the drama is no more than before. But as long as the city is still there, everything will slowly return to its original state."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My opinion is that there are people who send flowers is not bad," Benis snorted. "There were only six theaters, and now there are only three, I hope we will not become Next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of Roentgen has become quite emotional. "Yes, that war has changed too much..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, two ladies, we have to see the benefits." Aigepo coughed twice, "The rapids of the Kajin Theatre Big, isn't it because of the absorption of the three people? The kings can't control the alternation, but they have been alternated so many times in history. Are you still alive? In short, the spirit is coming, the teacher is still waiting for us. - Don't let him see what we are discouraging."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you mention Kajin Fez, everyone can't help but nod, yes, from After the return of the winter city, the teacher seemed to be suddenly a few years old. They all blame Mey for not telling the origins of the Shadows, and also taking the possibility to be secret. Since this is the case, they naturally have to work harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, bothering--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going to the study, Aegis pushes away The door, then a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the room seems a bit too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kajin did not sit on the soft couch waiting for them as they used to, but stood at the table, a look of disappointment. After a while, he only looked at them, "...come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, what happened?" Benis also I noticed the other person's strangeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No winter city letter, written by His Majesty the King." Kajin picked up the letter on the desk and handed it to everyone. "Let's take a look." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...can you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the indication, Aeger took the stationery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others immediately encircled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at everyone’s expectation, Kajin sighed in secret. Apparently they were thinking the same way they saw the letter at the moment - someone secretly blocked the communication of the message, which led the troupe to return to the old kingdom without any action. Now that he is known by his sire, the person who is stalking should be unlucky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he guessed the beginning, but could not guess the ending.陛 < br 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实 确实The "instrument" is the key to the shadow. However, it is not enough to have a witch. It uses some things left over from ancient times. These things are extremely rare and basically impossible to meet. Therefore, the “instruments” are also rare, and they are rare things that are neither price nor market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
