			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before ten hours, it received a report saying that there was an abnormal sound and a huge fireball in the direction of the wolf heart, and a supply unit was hit hard, and at that time it was still In a city in the western part of Yongdong, accept the loyalty of the human lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Heckzod did not want to pay attention to this sesame-sized thing, if the reporter did not repeatedly mention the embarrassment of the explosion and the unusual destructive power, It was not intended to come in person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating with humans is enough to bother it, but it can only be done in the entire Western Front. Not every man is as smart as Ursuk, he always learns something useful and useless - most of the promoters see humans as bugs, not to mention their language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its generals are no exception, all loyal, abilities are beyond doubt, but only limited to fighting, let these guys deal with humans, can’t For a long time, they will violently tear each other into pieces. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, human beings are a very easy to tame creature. Although this group is weak, the brain is very good. In the early stage of development, they can replace many inferior bodies. The elimination of all work does not meet the interests of the ethnic group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, this is Wakiris’s fault. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was originally the best monarch who was good at this, but now it’s still in Dianchi, Heckzod always feels that his patience is getting closer to the bottom line. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when it flew over the city of Tooth, it immediately realized that something was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The floating in the city is very thin and seems to have been cleaned up. The city is even more insane, and everywhere you can see the destroyed houses and charred wooden frames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the team descended, Heckzod found the ground exuding warmth, and the pungent smell came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It quickly found the source of the taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of strange and inferior bodies curled up on the street, their skin has turned black and fell off, apparently burned by fire. But the strange thing is that there are no obvious firelights around the inferior body. Except for the masonry, it is hard to imagine how the flame burned on them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more than one such scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Totolock, you and your men bring ten people each to search for the movements of the human army. If you find it, report it to me immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow the Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"West Asia, investigate to see what is going on, by the way Look for someone who is still alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promoters Soon after, he went to Long Street and slowly walked to the most destructive North District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the report, the attacker was an inferior body supply team, and these poor creatures that could never be promoted were at the bottom of the ethnic group, equivalent to human beings. Labor or slave. They were responsible for transporting a batch of black slate and secondary Dianchi into the city of fangs, so that they could build a camp for the ascension or promotion of the rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be seen from the wreckage on the scene. The obsidian that has been cut and soaked is scattered everywhere, and some inferior bodies are still kept in transit. appearance. The absence of signs of killing meant that humans did not come into contact with the supply team, and the battle broke out very suddenly and ended extremely quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the other party has placed a trap here, instead of assembling a large army under the eyelids of the Bogle Winged Beast, Toto Locke’s search is likely to have nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more so, the more I feel the heart of the Scorpio Lord. It would rather have enemies coming in groups, which would at least be easier to spot. Heikzod does not care about the inferior body's life and death, but the Western Front campaign can not be lost. If the trap like this is hit by the main force, the consequences are simply unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to burn the flames of inferior bodies in isolation, and it is the first time I have seen them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the entire city becomes a huge stove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If humans have such a means, then they must let the king know that the Western Front is dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc...the flame? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod’s mind suddenly flashed a picture—the sight that was seen when searching the memory of Cabradaby in the consciousness circle A group of bright and incomparable fireballs suddenly opened like the rising sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it... this is the flame weapon that Cabradaby saw at the time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can’t help but feel a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of the suspicion of the Scorpio Lord, the voice of Siassis suddenly interrupted its thoughts. "Adults, the basic situation has been identified, this There are a total of 350 inferior bodies in the supply team, and there are also ten native bodies providing them with escorts. Survivors have not been found yet, but I think I have already figured out the means of those bugs."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Let's listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come with me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod followed Saias to the north wall, some primitives are burying their heads, and there are a pile of dark metal fragments scattered around them. Further afield, several siege vehicles swayed across the road – these old-fashioned war instruments became specialized handling tools since the more powerful and flexible symbiosis was successfully cultivated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see," Siassis extended the tentacles and grabbed a piece of debris on the ground. There was a clear trace of melting at the break. "If you put them together, It should be a container. And such things are arranged along the edge of the city, there are almost a few hundred. I think the worms are probably stuffed with snow powder and combustibles, and I plan to cut off the supply team and then smash it. Indiscriminately launched an attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human beings are still no strangers to the weapons they use, and in the process of chasing each other, Heckzod also A lot has been seized. Whether it is "fire branch" or "fire", it uses the detonation of snow powder as an introduction. It is obviously more complicated than the magic-driven weapon. Because of this, the structure of those weapons is mostly subtle, which is also the skill that was not seen four hundred years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can it cause such a big damage if it is just a normal flame?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult This flame is probably not ordinary, at least the temperature is much higher than the average fire, but even so, it is impossible to kill all the inferior bodies by air. I think the key point may be on those siege cars."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Heikezod asked. Assias is a psychic warlock, and most of the promoters from this branch have a keen observation, which is why the Scorpio Lord sent it to investigate the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the snow powder was detonated, it was likely to have affected the siege car that was passing through the gate at the time - the latter was generally used to transport heavy loads, not Dianchi is a storage tank. The high temperature makes them deflagrate, and further aggravates the collapse of life. “The other side’s fast-swinging tentacles keep humming. “You know, when the temperature is high enough, anything can I was ignited, including us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interpretation of West Asia has made Hecksod a little relieved, regardless of whether the big bang had a coincidence. At least that huge iron bucket fragment makes it a lot of peace of mind. It is a complete concept that a large number of buryings are required in advance and can be projected at any time. As long as they are strictly guarded, such traps are difficult to pose a threat to large units in the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it’s also clear that it’s not easy to quickly check a human city – it’s not possible to keep the Dianchi and storage tanks in close transport and stacking To eliminate this threat, it does not believe that it can be done by relying on simple primitives and inferior bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective way is to use humans themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
