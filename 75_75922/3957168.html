			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the diaspore reaches the gem level, it will reflect the brilliant light due to the high fire color, and has a strong pleochroism - and other The difference between a color-changing gem and a single color is that it can refract a variety of colors at the same time. The most obvious one is red and green, and it is no wonder that the locals will be named in the colorful. Before I heard Barry’s introduction, I didn’t think about it. When I saw it, Roland immediately thought of this stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, when the diaspore is dehydrated, it will be transformed into corundum... and the gemstone of corundum is the famous ruby ​​and sapphire. The latter's reputation is more prominent than the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not the gems themselves that excite him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Residues dug out of the mine?" After a long time, the prince closed the wooden box and asked excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean... the gravel dug up when you opened the mine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it's not just stones, mud is counted, how do you dispose of these wastes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After shipment, they are dumped at the foot of the mountain," Denver didn't seem to understand the meaning of the prince asking about the matter. "His Highness, please rest assured that we have carefully screened these ores, either the texture is too bad, or it is broken during the mining process and can no longer be polished into gems. The screening process is the responsibility of the most experienced veteran in the family, and there is no possibility of omission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are wrong," Roland smiled and shook his head. Those things... are probably the real "treasures." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? "Denford suddenly stopped, and the look of others looked quite strange, like how could it not connect the mud and the treasure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s hard to explain this thing – because this era is even more sturdy in steelmaking, let alone refining elemental aluminum.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main component of diaspore is alumina At the same time, as a companion product of bauxite, it has been found. A great chance means that the aluminum element is enriched here, and both soil and rock can be used as raw materials for aluminum smelting. As the most abundant metal element in the earth, aluminum The reserves are higher than iron, almost omnipresent. In other words, just dig a stone from the ground, Lucia can also decompose a trace of aluminum - just for industrial refining is not worthwhile, so only aluminum The enriched place has the value of exploitation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the cave in front of you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Pei Luo alone called aside and whispered, "The Kezhen family has been in these two hundred years. Management gems like mine? What I mean is... How did the previous leaders pay their compensation? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found out from the books left over by Osmond Ryan that the way to pay is very simple, that is, the Kezhen family can get from every year. Among the collected gems, the secondary gems of one box are selected as the reward, which is basically the same as the method of weighing wheat. Pei explained, "The square box is almost the same length and width, and the depth is half a palm. As long as it can cover the lid, how many can be put in it." Of course, the most precious gems must be turned over to the lord. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, the two family collections that he just sent me are not the best?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really the best in terms of texture. At this point he doesn’t dare to lie to you, but you also know that the gem is always bigger and more expensive. . "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also received his gift, right? "Roland looked at the eldest son of honeysuckle with interest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." The latter responded a bit slyly. "Yes, Your Highness, I will go back." Give the gem to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave it, I don't care about this," the prince did not think. "I am just curious. Who will guarantee that this reward is true?" What if the family secretly takes more during the mining process? In addition to the fact that this kind of thing is going to the bottom of the house, can you not find it? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every batch of ore is transported out of the hole and screening will be supervised, and even if the Kezhen family steals it, it will not be too obvious - this is A mutual checks and balances, they are afraid of being severely punished by the lord’s discovery, and the lord can’t find so many people who know the mine well,” Pei Luoton paused. “Moreover, even if you put on your own people, who is Can you guarantee that you will not steal it? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
