			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate on the desperate mountains is always slower than the foot of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the cat's claws still don't know much about this sentence, and now they finally understand its true meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the end of the evil month, most towns have entered the snowing period, wherever they can hear the sound of pattering water, the wet soil on the roadside Can see the new green shoots. But in the mountains of the desperate mountains, everything is still the same, most of the places are covered by the snow of the white pelicans, and there are a string of ice ribs on the edge of the cliff. When crossing the path below, they are always worried. Will the stout "needle tip" suddenly fall down? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no hummingbirds and goddess of witches, they simply don’t want to put heavy weapons on the pre-determined position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it makes the cat's claws faint, which is the goal of this mission - the devil's mobile fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still more than 20 kilometers apart, but you don’t need a lookout mirror to look directly at it. It occupies almost half of the sky in the north, and its contours and breath are incompatible with the surrounding world. The exposed stone is dark and horny, like a knife-cut axe, in stark contrast to the revitalized fertile plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the land, it is a diffuse red mist. They are the highest in the center of the fortress, and then slowly spread out to the periphery. When they reach the edge, they only have a few laps, and they pour down the low point of the terrain, looking far away from the red ribbon hanging around the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This giant giant has put tremendous pressure on the cat's claws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance of 20 kilometers in the past means absolute safety. The enemy and the enemy are still small black spots on the earth. It is difficult to realize whether it is found or played. But now, this distance seems to be close at hand, and he feels that he can be knocked down and crushed by this head-on mountain at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the enemy's fortress, their positions and artillery are a bit insignificant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the headquarters also took this into consideration, and they will gather together the officers who have been following the army’s south march. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He retracted the hidden sentinel and shouted a long sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep breathing helps relieve tension, which is also the teaching of your knees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, fear?" The pomelo peeled over and gathered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Cat claws glanced at each other, "How can I be afraid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Then is not a shameful thing," the latter took the lookout and poked his head from the observation point of the simple fortification. "To be honest, this reminds me of the artillery team facing the long song fortress for the first time." The scene when the Cavaliers charge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat's claws are slightly different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He naturally will not forget the experience of the first battle on the battlefield - the same is the very short time of the evil moon, also the enemy facing the momentum, he almost several times Put the solid shells in the carrying on your feet. Before he became a member of the military, he could not imagine in any way that he would one day be able to stand in front of the knights who rushed to the front and balance them with each other instead of begging for mercy or turning around and fleeing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he thought he was about to die, his legs trembled like a sieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, it’s just that the opponent has become a floating land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the memories in my mind overlap with reality, the cat's claws find that their heartbeat is abruptly smooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remembered, you were so nervous at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Oh, don't say me, even the captain of Vanner is not much better.” The pomelo looks at the target. “But at least we didn’t forget to fire, this is enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, fear is not a big deal, as long as they can fulfill their responsibilities - whether the enemy is a noble knight or a floating continent, the only thing they have to do is to fire the artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, there is movement on the fortress!" The pomelo peel suddenly lowered the voice. "It is a fearful beast, the devil reacts!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So fast?" The cat's claws suddenly became tight, and the distance was far from the shot range. If the devil was discovered too early, the blocking action would end up failing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a huge amount...God," the pomelo peel swallowed. "It is likely to be more than a hundred!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly raised the lookout mirror, and saw the black spots flying in the red fog, and lined up on the edge of the floating land. For this scene, the cat's claws are familiar. However, the other party is gathering troops, and an attack is about to begin. But the location of the devil seems to be a bit wrong...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and reacted almost at the same time. "They found a camouflage camp!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the real sniper position, there are also many artillery pieces placed on another preset position, but they are all modeled with wood and paint on the spot, and also Not covered with camouflage nets, it seems that this arrangement has obviously worked! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan, the enemy from the sky will be blocked by the empty knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the better the teammate’s battle, the longer the lure point can be hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if they noticed the enemy's movements..." The cat claws muttered. Due to the red fog on the floating land, the witches were not arranged in the blocking force, which made the artillery unable to contact the entire army. Compared to the full assistance of lightning and wheat, their vision is no doubt narrower at the moment. But thinking about this situation will be more and more in the future, he can only get used to this change as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not worry," the pomelo peels the fist, "I want to know the man who leads the Cavaliers, but that adult!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the wheat, observing the devil's movement!" Tilly's cockpit sounded the report of the expedition , "direction, east three times; number one hundred and three, there are large beasts in the queue, more than one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Received." Li readily injects the magic into another listening inscription. "The enemy is acting, and the possibility of moving the magic eye is not ruled out. The Seagull continues to hover and wait for the next step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Understanding," answered her by Andrea. "Are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uh huh." She should easily Dao, "On my behalf, ask the next gauze, the taste of flying the plane should be good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness...when can you come back, me, I always I feel that it will fall off at any time! Sigil of yarn Wei came in faint cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Concentrate!" Then Wendy interrupted her. "Hold the joystick, just like during training, and I will help you." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since getting the Phoenix, Tilly began to look for successors, and she is more eager to revenge for the ashes than to hide behind the scenes. In the end, Sawyer took over this burden and set the shortest record from training to real flight. Of course, in addition to her "enthusiastic teaching", Wendy, who is more proficient in controlling the wind, is also a key factor. As long as it is not a random manipulation, it is difficult to find a problem with a glider powered by Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...the general situation is like this." Andrea helped the forehead. "Besides the dizziness of Sylvie, the rest is basically normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, then I am leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tilly!" Andrea's The voice suddenly rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am listening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Attention...safe."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
