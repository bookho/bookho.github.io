			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later, the second day after the winter, Barov brought news of the successful signing of the joint chamber of commerce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the final negotiation is that the sale of the grey fort is handled by Margaret, and the islands of the sunset and the shallow water city supply the island and the winter and the wolf heart respectively. The bay took the other islands of the fjord, plus the morning kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Roland unexpected is that he also saw an arithmetic equation on the contract, which is to set several main classification conditions as unknowns, depending on the specific situation. Fill in it and you will get the share of the year's income. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who wrote this?" he asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My disciple," Barov said with a smile on his beard. "In the summary, he found that instead of listing a complicated schedule, it is better to use this. The expression is appropriate, and all three parties agree with its accuracy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that I did not teach these in universal education."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you open an intermediate class? I bought a mathematics textbook for each disciple and let them listen to the books and adults when they have time." He exclaimed. "I am getting older, and the speed of learning things can't keep up with these guys, so I have to be cheaper. If you are ten years younger and leave your writing, I will definitely look around with you every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This horse took Roland to be comfortable, and realized that mathematics knowledge is helpful for finance and administration, and the vision of the Minister is also good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Itis? How did she talk about her performance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Strong," Barov coughed twice. "Although she has fascinated those businessmen, it is obviously inexperienced when it comes to specific trade terms. I guess she rarely deals with sea merchants. After all, the trade in the North is not developed. Unlike the old kings, the finance minister summons visiting fjord merchants almost every day. I want to be the year--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I know, "Looking at the other party's entry into the memory mode, Roland quickly interrupted. "In this case, you will teach her more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss His face was stiff, "Hey, this...hey, she is actually..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just set," he sighed, according to the nightingale from behind. The frequency of his shoulders is known, and the credibility of these words is not high. It’s just that this kind of competition is like a small report. He doesn’t want to pay attention to it. As long as he doesn’t do things, “Is it right, how many people have not added this winter city to complete the expected goal?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is still a month or so from the end of the year, with the arrival of winter, the immigration mission will return to the winter city without a break, and the number of migrants will inevitably decrease drastically. Basically, it has been determined whether the target is achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I mentioned this, Barov’s face suddenly burst into flowers, and the wrinkles on his forehead were squeezed into a gully, and the cockroaches just flew away. "Your Majesty, the City Hall has already counted, and the number of people who have moved from all over the country has exceeded 80,000, of which 50% are voluntarily coming. Plus the indigenous people in Bianbu District and Changge District, there is no winter city. The total population has already reached 110,000!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Roland’s heart was happy, "Has half of the volunteers come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The majority of them come from the central and eastern regions of the kingdom, not obvious in spring and summer. In the fall, the proportion begins to rise, so continue to next year. The traitors who support Tefko are estimated to be unable to sit still."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be the effect of Tassa’s spread of the church’s defeat to the East. However, Roland still hopes that the nobles will persist for a while, so that he has an excuse to eradicate them together, and also a citizen of the East. New Kingdom set orderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ready for the winter is already done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two months ago City Hall "There is a good answer," Barov replied confidently. "The Ministry of Construction commissioned Miss Lian to build a new cave between the Desolate Mountains and the Chishui River to replace the wind shacks. We have accumulated a lot of charcoal. To ensure that everyone can get a basket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
