			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first ceremony was held until noon, and Roland, who was a ambassador, commentator and moderator, was exhausted and good at the end. The ceremony was finally concluded in the midday noon and the salute of the salute. Going back to the castle with sweat and sweat, just stepping on the third floor, he saw Anna leaning against the office door with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know when you go in," she said Double beautiful lake blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a whole show, Roland is pushing the door open, then kneeling in the same place – seeing the twelve witches neatly Standing in two rows, the top is the scroll and Wendy. When the prince appeared, everyone raised the skirt, bent down and bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, you are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book is the first to speak, "His Highness, Your actions prove everything you say, and the sisters are very grateful for it. No words can describe our gratitude. Please let us continue to work for you in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out," Roland sighed. "I thought you were going to collectively resign."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Wendy I can't help but laugh out, "How is it possible, Your Highness, this is the holy mountain that the witch dreams of. As long as you don't drive us away, we hope to live here all the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"And this is what I want to see... In fact, you don't have to be like this. I am doing this not only to help you, but also to help me. Don't be too serious, I prefer your relaxed appearance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I said no formality like this," Lily snorted. "Look, he." I suspect that we are too serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which said, you just agreed to come down with it," the mystery whispered, "traitor! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, everyone goes to the restaurant first, and the temple must change clothes," the book helplessly supported the forehead. "Right, listen to Miss Anna." Have you slept lately? Please take care of your body. You must not fall before that goal is achieved."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure," Roland smiled. "I am very well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the witches sneaked out, there was only him and Anna left in the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, do you want to thank me?" Roland teased her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... I want to say the same as them," Anna said, raising her lips. "No words can describe my gratitude." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then... hope to live in Bianbu Town? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not necessarily. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned, and his heart pounded. "Why?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you won't stay here all the time," Anna snorted. "...and wherever you go, I will always follow you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly had a warm current in his heart. From the day she knew her, her thoughts have never changed. Whether it is an invitation to the Communist Youth League She is still in a critical moment against the evil beast. She chooses to stand with herself.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Anna suddenly took the first two steps and gently hugged Lived in him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, sweat. Roland reminded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl did not answer, but put her head on his chest, as if he wanted to write down the taste and took a deep breath. In the end, she gave up her intention to push her away, and her hands covered her white neck, which had not been released for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called Carl Vabert and spread out a detailed map of Bianbu Town, pointing to the Chishui River location. "I want to build a bridge here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Isn't it a pontoon?" Carl Si said with a moment. "Please excuse me, His Royal Highness, Chishui River is nearly 100 meters wide. It is almost impossible to build a stone bridge. Even arch bridges can only span three at most. One-minute distance, and the water flow of the Chishui River is extremely large, and the pier cannot be settled at all. Even a thick stone pile will be washed down... except for the raft crossing and the pontoon, there is no bridge on the whole river." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not a stone bridge, but a steel bridge," Roland explained. "A total of three spans, the middle pier will be solved by a witch. You only need to advance Put the bridge part in place. But I asked for the slope at the bridgehead to raise the entire bridge so that the riverboat could pass, and the mast would not touch the bottom of the bridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that the bridge set up in the sky?" Carl was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just about six or seven meters from the ground," he sketched the three-span iron bridge on the sketch. "In order to better develop the South Bank in the future, As well as the construction of the dock, there must be a bridge on the river that does not affect the ship. Although the pontoon is simple, it is equivalent to blocking the river and is not good for subsequent development."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trip to Wangdu of the First Army Expedition gave Roland a lot of inspiration - he found that the rivers in the Grey Fort are well-connected, and the major cities are basically built alongside several major rivers. If there are several shallow-water heavy artillery ships in the future, it will definitely provide a weapon for fire support and siege. After all, the power of the guns known as caliber is far from being comparable to field guns. And to build a ship, first he had to have a dock, so the plan for the steel bridge came into being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I don't have a bridge-like construction experience..." Carl looked a little hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have it," Roland shrugged. "It's the first time you've been groping for a long time. You can set up a bridge on the shore to test." "No problem, then move to the Chishui River," he indirectly infused with the overall prefabricated, one-time lifting construction concept, "just like installing a water tower, there are hummingbirds to reduce its weight, and your student Anna helps assembly and welding. It won't be difficult to go anywhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow the command, Your Highness." He nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a very important project to be handed over to you," the prince moved his finger to the castle area. "I plan to expand the size of the backyard. All the open spaces on the high ground are circled and a three-story building is built here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all goes well, the five witches of Tilly will be next month Arrived in Bianbu Town, and there are no more rooms in the castle. Although it can be temporarily changed to a three-person, but the witches are always more and more, it is impossible to keep doing it. The superior living environment and all kinds of novel and comfortable experiences are also one of his strategies to retain witches. Whether it is the luxury of the ancients or the modern sugar-coated artillery, the beautiful and comfortable life can always make people addicted to it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three-story...brick house?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not entirely brick houses, Roland smiled. "The name should be called brick-concrete structure. The pillars and top beams are made of reinforced concrete, just like human bones. This structure allows the house to be built higher and later stamped. There are no problems in the fourth and fifth floors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reinforcement...Concrete?" Carl repeated in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a mixture of cement, sand and stones, with steel bars embedded in it to enhance its bending resistance," he said. "Of course, each ingredient is specific. How much is incorporated requires rigorous testing. If the configuration is successful, it is even stronger than natural bluestone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, the quality of this kind of thing There is a very large elastic space, the same is concrete, the cement is self-configured in the countryside, and the metering configuration of the mixing station is completely different. The same is true for steel bars... Some people don’t even put pebbles in their homesteads, or they use iron wire or bamboo chips instead of steel bars. When Roland stayed in the country, he saw several “country houses” The process of starting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he intends to follow suit, after all, it’s just a three-story house, and it’s hard to collapse if you cut corners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
