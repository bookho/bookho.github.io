			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as the god of God's creation fell, there was a riot below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod suddenly opened the door of twisting, and sent himself and the silence to Roland, and wanted to take him alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the god of punishment, the Roland group surrounded, and launched the field of banned magic, neither of them willing to give in, just like a sword. If it wasn't for the news that the lightning was coming in time and the land began to slow down, Cerroshhi was afraid that he had already pulled out the sword and shot it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also makes Roland clearly aware that although the other party temporarily agrees to cooperate, the appeal of interests is not the same - or, in addition to Wakiris In addition, they have not really understood the threat of the gods. All that is done now is only because of the nightmare of the dream king who is trapped in the dream world. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But regardless of the process, the restoration of the god of God's creation means that Celine has successfully achieved core control, and a disaster has finally disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The follow-up reports are basically good news, no one lost in the first army, only three people fell and fell in a hurry; the spider in anticipation The devil did not appear, and the madman who was controlled did not riot because of the accident. The whole course of action was shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Saline came to Roland without saying a word, he realized that the situation might not be that simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is usual, she should have been dancing and telling what she saw and heard when she controlled the god of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are as real as he thinks, or even more incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The false face actually built a "magic net" across the two continents with the core of the ethnic group and the magic core as a node, and triggered it remotely through it. The sudden fall of the god of God. The key person who reversed all of this is actually an ancient witch who is thousands of miles away. More precisely, it is the ancient witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of them is one of the three seats of the former federation, Eleanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She wants to see me?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, I want you to see her." Celine confided her fears. "She said she is not a qualified three. Xi, but the sacrifices and dedications made for the federation, everyone is in the eyes... Now she can easily see the light again, I don't want her to disappear like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The god of God has not been able to sustain it..." Roland thought. Without the god stone, the obelisk will quickly decay, which has already been proven by the Quest. The mother of the soul is the foundation of the whole tower, and will undoubtedly die with it. The key point is to provide a new source of magic before this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing he has never done before, the understanding of the devil's mother is also close to zero. If it is carried out a year and a half ago, it is estimated that there is nothing to do. But now that he has the help of Wakiris and Heckzod, he can't change the doomed ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"陛下..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure," Roland said comfortably. "The other party is saving." The heroes of the two kingdoms of Grey Fort and Dawn, even if you don't mention it, I will try to keep her as much as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since technically no shortage Sex, then the most important thing at the moment is to change the mind of the other person. This is also a reason for treatment. A person who believes in conviction is far more likely to survive than those who give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when it comes to the mouth, Roland has not yet lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the God of God, he stood before the core of the magic of rotation, Nodded to Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is different from the ideology. Roland can't be directly connected to the carrier. Therefore, it must be communicated through Celin to communicate with Eleanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess, you are the human king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland Wimbledon." He closed his eyes and replied in his head in a relaxed tone. "First time, I am very glad that you can get out of the central carrier, Eleanor of three seats."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, you can't really see me. Now my body is just an ugly devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is only a temporary situation. Since your consciousness can enter here, you can enter one day. The world of consciousness. There, you can not only change back to the original, but also see many past partners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dream world...I heard before Celine said that it was indeed an incredible place." Eleanor paused. "But she should tell you that the core veins of the city will soon run out. I can't wait until then." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Change to a place, etc." Roland is straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no stone in the winter city, I can move you Going there to take root - indeed, this is technically difficult, such as how to get you out of the Red Mist Lake, and how to send it to the winter without a red mist supply. But I believe that these are carefully prepared. It can be realized later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a small price." Eleanor seemed to sneer. "This is not good for you. It is a game." What did Lin promise from you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master Eleanor, I didn't do this -" Celine argued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How could it be no good!" Roland interrupted her. "Your presence is vital to humans, but you don't realize it." Just point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleanor glimpsed, "To the mark...Important?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The fact that the mask can get control of the core instrument through the 'net' is no doubt. The core of the future is obviously an important tool for studying magic. At present, only you can expel it. This is of great significance." Roland said, "Of course this is not the most important thing -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly lowered his speech rate and said one word at a time, "If humans have one like this, In the floating city, the war situation will completely fall to our side!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was not only Eleanor, but even Serin was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to build God of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it? We There is no need to start from scratch. There are core instruments with masks and good controllers. There is only one obelisk in comparison.” Roland opened his hand. “But I don’t have to raise such a large site. A floating island of one or two kilometers is enough to take off and land a heavy bomber. It can even go directly to the bottomless place with an army. The premise is that you can smoothly understand the structure of these magic cores and apply them to the new god stone. On the veins - I know it's not easy. If it doesn't work, I won't think you're worse than a mask. At least you tried to do it, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Do you think it is not a qualified three seats? No problem, just give you a new goal. Even the radicals are arranged, and they are unmasked. When it comes to this, you are not good enough to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound in my mind suddenly fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Eleanor exclaimed, "I understand that 'the least like the king of the king' is what it means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I didn't say anything." There is a sense of liberation in the voice. "It’s just Mr. Roland. You seem to have made a mistake. All that you have imagined is based on the ability to successfully transfer the mother. I know this is not easy, if it ends up If you don't succeed, I won't blame you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eleanor--!" Serin rejoiced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
