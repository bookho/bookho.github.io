			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter smiled and touched Dai Lan’s head. "Don’t look at the mystery month now. She used to be more timid than before." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah-hitting, hitting!" Mystery Month quickly pleaded, "That's all in the past!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Is there such a thing?" Luo Jia raised her ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, she only dared to come to me after everyone fell asleep. If I could say it, I couldn’t finish it in one day--"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!" Mystery Moon shouted, "Open the condition, Wendy sister!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured Well, I won't disclose it casually... But the book complained to me yesterday, the Executive Office was too busy, and the archives had been taken care of for a long time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I will go there, the detective team will retire!" She also blinked at the two before leaving. "We will see you again at night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cut." The wolf woman grinned and walked outside the courtyard with the crowd. "I am going to help out, who will make me feel good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Until a few witches walked away, the gray rabbit stretched his elbows and slammed the bell, and lowered his voice and said, "I see that Luo Jiajie clearly does not want to be classified as a lazy person, just follow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...is ? Like it "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" Puchi "Momo could not help but laugh out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dai Lan was also a little surprised, although only for a moment, but on the way to escape from the owner's territory, she never saw each other with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everything is good here, sometimes it will make a lot of noise, but you will get used to it after a long time." Wendy said softly, "Come, let us Start by looking at the residence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking through the building, wear Lan has been surprised to say nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still such a comfortable room in the world! Although they are not big, they are all exquisite, even if they are ordinary mattresses, they have unimaginable exquisiteness and softness. She has not seen the residence of aristocratic family, or in the years of being imprisoned by her master, except for the shackles and chains, the place where she stays the most is the bedroom. Even so, the large beds that are well-formed and padded with several layers of cotton can't be compared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy insisted on letting her lie down and try, she didn’t even sigh with scorn, and all the exhaustion accumulated was overwhelmed. Let her almost never want to get up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Momo’s performance is not much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter also explained carefully that the mattress is so soft because hundreds of springs are placed inside, no matter how it rolls, you can get it. The best fit between the bed and the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Dylan doesn’t understand what the spring is, at least it’s made of pure steel – using cast armor materials to improve the mattress Comfort, she did not know for a moment that it was the ingenuity of the inventor, or the ruin of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a pipe that will automatically discharge water when it is twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a mirror that hangs in the washroom and can clearly see each of its own hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, step on a soft and non-slip floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a desk lamp that glows when it is filled with magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the seemingly simple wooden furniture has a sense of difference, she can't say the specific difference, but it is very easy to use. Compared with the aristocracy's wide-fledged houses, it is more like a "home" for living and living. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can we... live in this place too?" Momo hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, as long as you are willing to join the Witch Alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can also choose not to join ?" Dai Lan was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because we have experienced the tragedy of the co-help..." For a moment, Wendy showed some regrets and regrets on her face. "Don't mention those." In short, you can choose your own place, remember the questions asked by the examiner when you pass the harbour checkpoint?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan nodded. At that time, only she and Momo were invited to the hut, and they were still worried for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is a threat review, only for witches. After all, if a person with magic is malicious, the damage will be much greater than the average person. But once confirmed You can live freely in the city without threatening no winter. In fact, in addition to the witch alliance, there is also a witch organization called the Sleeping Curse. It is also developed by the fugitive witch. Its leader is Roland. Wimbledon's younger sister." Wendyton paused. "Of course, you can choose not to join any organization, live independently, and I will provide guidance and help - in my personal capacity."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our ability..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not the point, the point is what you think about Life." Wendy smiled and shook her head. "If you don't mind, can you talk to me about your past?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This warm feeling is like Water is surrounded by Dylan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-haired woman in front of her seems to be born to be trustworthy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it’s just a short moment, she doesn’t want to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps after she has finished everything, the warmth will cease to exist, but at least for now, she can still extend the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dailan bit his lip and slowly said everything he had experienced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before awakening as a witch, she is no different from most people in the village, and her awakening is similar to other witches, being expelled, hated, Being chased... There is no way to go, she heard the rumors of the bloody meeting. A place to be safe is undoubtedly the thing she was most eager at the time, risking being caught by the church. Dai Lan finally turned to Dagong Island and found the recipient of the bloody meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not expect her to usher in a bigger disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood tooth not only did not accept her, but sold her to a wolf-hearted aristocrat. In the following years, she was repeatedly resold many times until she fell into the hands of the former owner. Her ability has also become a way of assisting - the "pill" with magical ability not only delays pain, but also delays feelings of anxiety and happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For treatment, its meaning is minimal, because the negative experience will not be eliminated, it will only be delayed until the end of the efficacy, the injury is not heavy enough to say If the pain exceeds a certain level, the moment of the outbreak is no less than an additional fatal injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the former owner used her as a tool for enjoyment and continued to use the "pill" to gain greater pleasure. Not only that, but he also shared her with other nobles and used this kind of transaction to get used to the relationship. At that time, Dai Lan met Momo and several witches who were betrayed by blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She understands that the so-called "safe place" is just a scam created by the bloody teeth and the nobility. It’s much easier to catch them and wait for the witch to find the door. Later, Dai Lan was horrified to discover that with the invasion of the church, the familiar witches in the "private banquet" began to go one by one, and gradually only she and Momo were left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a certain nobleman said that he had missed his mouth, she knew that those people either used the witch as a reward, or they solved it as trouble. Lost, as for the solution, it just makes her shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dylan decided to take advantage of the chaos brought by the Hermes Church and flee Momo with this prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
