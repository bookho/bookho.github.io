			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two screamed, "You mean the world. ...interracial?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the ancient witches, the dream world is more difficult to adapt to modern life than the Kajiad people who live in the city - these have The minority races of the same appearance as the devil have been regarded as a part of humanity. Not only are words and deeds similar to human beings, but they can also breed each other and are completely different from the undead enemies outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s almost an instinct to see the devil, and in Roland’s repeated account, they are not able to restrain this impulse, now It is necessary to suddenly increase vigilance. It must be said that it is difficult for ordinary people to reverse it. Therefore, the first thing he thought of was the first batch of Felice and Yann who followed themselves into the dream, and the main ability was very suitable for hiding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can think so." Roland told the other person's characteristics and suspiciousness, "I didn't see any magic stone in her, this is also with The real devil is the biggest difference. But you still have to be cautious and monitor if you have the ability to have the magic stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading history is to understand a world The most effective way, who is so eager to know the past of the dream world? If the "devil" called Wakiris really comes from the Kajid Peninsula, she should have also received compulsory education. It can be seen from the words of Fiji Han, the other party read the history books almost in chronological order. This is enough to be suspicious at the nodes where both worlds are simultaneously eroded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty." The two nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Even if you confirm that the other person is the devil, don't do it in the nursing home," Roland thought for a moment and added, "One is that there are many awakenings, easy There was an accident. Second, I wanted to find out how she came to this side through the memory debris."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the room at the end of 0510 can be connected Not one or two high-order devil's lairs, but an extremely large alien city. If other devils can also pass through the gate, then it is really a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, just..." Felice hesitated. "If we are not with you, if it is dangerous..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, this is not the real world," Roland smiled. "You have also seen that the ability of those who are demon can not hurt me, as long as If you don't take the initiative to go to the insurance, they basically have nothing to do. But you, remember to give priority to yourself, call me every few hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ...obey, squat." The two looked at each other and said, "We are leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;******** ***********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire room is in a special phase state with two boundaries overlapping when entering the underground assembly point The floor and walls are covered by scarlet magic light, as if they are as bright as the embers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this state, the film area is equivalent to a fictional space that is isolated from the world, and no real thing can affect it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This naturally includes tracking and exploration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw that Beta still held her hands in a half-squatting posture, her body shape was close to translucent, like an illusory shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the time flow here, he has maintained this position for almost half a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not finished yet?" Ipsy looked at the delta standing still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter's mask flashed, it seems that the consciousness can no longer be used directly for communication, hoarse and scorpion replied, "The world is very bloated, comprehensive analysis It's not that easy. But Beta's work is nearing completion, and I believe that there will be results soon. On your side? Have you heard any news?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The magic stealer set a trap and is waiting for us to cast the net."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough." Delta's tone has no ups and downs. "This seems to be a time-saving and labor-saving practice. Unfortunately, we don't need those scattered magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Ypsi nodded and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a simpler way to destroy these ideologies that are not controlled by the gods, that is, to directly destroy the creators of the ideology - they are mostly creators For the source, it is like the relationship between the house and the pillar. As long as the support column is removed, the world will collapse and the magical power to be distributed will be returned to the domain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the world is big enough. It’s not easy to find creators in countless goals, so they have to mobilize a lot of magic. Used to resolve the world in order to accurately locate its root cause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before invading Prism City is to solve the magic needs, there is a lot of core support, it is only a matter of time to complete the analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, finding does not mean that it can be successfully eliminated, the creators are often sheltered by the world, and the previous failures are also for this reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fight against asylum, you must pull the creator into the gap between the two worlds—where the gods can interfere with the rules of the world, and then attack Hey the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even if it is a god, there is a possibility of failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But time is running out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the last hopes of the gods. If even they fail, the gods will directly destroy the entire consciousness. The efforts of thousands of years will be ruined, and all the accumulated achievements will be attributed to nothingness. If it is not a last resort, the gods will never go out of this step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, everything is the fault of the master of this world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ipsixi involuntarily squeezed his fist, but quickly released it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, what's wrong with this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should she feel angry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a god, she should have no feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No emotions, no worries about victory or failure, she should not care about anything except her mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, I think that I have never considered a similar problem before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Delta noticed her move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, nothing..." She turned and went to the corner and sat down slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did this change start? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ipsy thought for a long time, only to vaguely notice that it was the moment from killing the traitor of the betrayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time she pretended to be among the apostles, quietly approaching the betrayal of her homologous relationship - until the moment of the shot, the latter reacted come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange thing is that the traitor did not make much resistance. When her arm pierced the other’s chest, she just gently held her blood. Arm, leaned over and said a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content she has not remembered clearly, but the voice...but unexpectedly familiar, even a kind of warmth, as if the long-awaited embrace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the final look of the betrayal’s face is a calm smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, what do you want to do now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, why am I angry for this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ipssy suddenly felt confused in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
