			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was such a turning point, and Ajima’s look was not very good. She turned to the beginning and stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I waited for Doris to come back, the book was re-opened. "I believe that many of you are like her, lost because of the displacement." The news from hometown, even if there is a chance to go back, finds that the hometown has turned upside down. This is the meaning of registration status - as long as some of them come to the winter city, even if only one person, you can get the exact news immediately, even Maybe there will be your loved ones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, the city hall's containment team is still active in the gray fort, this is a long-term process, heard from the news The number of emigrants will only be more and more, waiting for it to be easier to get news. Of course, if you need it, the squad can also focus on and collect information about your birthplace, and even send people directly to contact - Roland now I am fully capable of doing this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" Ajima looked up and stared at the book and asked, "The court Those big guys will be willing to help us do this "What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you say that the big man is a city hall official, I can count as one of the big guys," the book is a handkerchief, "actually No winter city operates in a different way from the past aristocratic territory. As long as the assessment is passed, the witch can also get involved in the administration and become a member of the kingdom management system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This caused a commotion in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the question you asked, the answer is natural," she continued. "No winter city has never thought of stopping you from leaving. Or limit your freedom, but now it is not a good time to leave. The war is unrest, the famine is everywhere, and many towns have become abandoned land, not only dangerous, but also easy to get nothing. On the way to recovering the territory, when the gray castle is unified and the order of the four regimes is restored, it is up to you to decide where to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking here, the book I picked up the registration form again. "So, do you still think it is unnecessary to fill this out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time, no witches have spoken again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s really a book, I didn’t think about it at the time. On the way back to the castle, Wendy couldn't help but sigh, "This witch alliance should leave a deep impression on them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I just took advantage of the next position," the book smiled. "The first batch of witches arrived was forty-six, and they will be busy in the next few days."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔..." Wendy’s voice went down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, you won’t want to say that you are not suitable for the position of Alliance Manager?" The book stopped, "Know that you are choosing you because of —”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Because I have advantages that others don’t have, right?” She suddenly laughed. “Reassure, since I last talked to me. After that, I have made up my mind. I just thought about how to receive it later. In fact, even in the difficult period of the Communist Youth League, I thought about staying with the sisters to find the holy mountain, but now The situation is completely heaven and earth compared with a few years ago. I have to say frustration again. I am sorry for the chaotic drink of the nightingale that I stole last time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This momentum is right," the book said with gratitude. "It's a drink. You don't mention me. I forgot it. I have helped you a lot. Should I have a drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "At night, let me have a little mushroom and fish fillets in the kitchen, how about drinking in the room?" Last time. If it is not enough, the nightingale is not in the winter city anyway. I will make up for her later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it." The book smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," Wendy looked at her forehead curiously. "You really remember the identity of 100,000 people without the winter city." Wouldn't it be confusing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how to describe it," the latter indulged for a moment. "The beginning was a bit complicated, I wanted To recall a certain content, you have to think about it from the beginning - for example, to find a name, the first thing to think about is the registration date of the other party, then the registration manual, and then the page number of the required message is recorded. It is cumbersome to say, and more will be thought of. Headache. But after a long time, I found that the content has gradually become organized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
