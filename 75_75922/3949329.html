			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun slowly falls into the mountains, and night falls to the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger found an open space not far from the road and set up a tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of the tent quickly raised the bonfire. The warriors took off their armor and stretched their tired bodies. They sat around the campfire and boiled water and porridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleania drilled into the tent with a basin of hot water. "God official, please wash your face."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Mila nodded with a smile and dipped the towel into the water. "We will be able to arrive in Bianbu Town tomorrow, and it will be hard all the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s nothing compared to dealing with evil beasts," she replied, "but Your riding technique makes me look good. I think that the priests are not good at going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, I am not a natural sergeant. It’s not uncommon to hurry.” Mira wiped the dust and sweat from her face with a towel and handed the pot to the female warrior. “You wash it too. How is it better now?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Eleania snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things of God's fines," the official smiled and shook his head. "Your mood is on your face, because of Abrams's words." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." She took the basin and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our, we will encounter many difficulties and challenges. If we can't cross these embarrassments, not only the church, the whole world will suffer. In order to block those terrible enemies, there are Sacrifice is a must," said Mila. "This is a dilemma, but don't forget the rumors of the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's light." Eleania whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s worthwhile to measure the cost. It’s important to see what the purpose is. The most important thing is that the conversion ceremony of the gods is completely voluntary. When Abu When Rams’s brother decided to become a god practising army, he was ready to sacrifice himself for the church. This is a noble ideal, and his name will be engraved on the glory, as the glory of the church spreads. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your guidance," Eleania raised her chest with her right hand. "I feel so much better."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred officials said yes, they are all dedicated to follow the glory of God, regardless of the outcome, the gods of the penalty army at least followed their own beliefs. Thinking of this, she felt that the suffocation of her chest was a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s good to help you," said Mira, chuckling. "Let’s go out for dinner, they should be ready. Really, recently Always drinking porridge, the tongue is almost out of taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good today is the last day," Eleania also laughed, "Tomorrow We should be able to enjoy the personal hospitality and sumptuous dinner of the lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eating the boring dinner, the presiding judge elected the night watchman tonight The trial warriors who were not assigned to the mission rushed into the tent and slept early. Eleania is no exception. She and the gods return to the tent, extinguish the oil lamp, and cover it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, just as she slept in her sleep, a slight muffled sound came from her ear - like something falling Generally on the ground. Soon, it is the second sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, she also heard the sound of the armor touching the ground, not obvious, but it is not an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes slammed open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned up and climbed, and Alliah quickly grabbed the two-handed sword around him and slowly leaned to the side of the tent, ready to pick up a corner to watch the situation, the other side has There was a roar of the presiding judge. "The enemy attack! The warriors, meet!" The snoring broke the silence of the night, and the camp suddenly boiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a loud noise! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She no longer hesitated, and a tumbling rushed out of the tent, only to see the judge's sword was split in half, no... not just his sword, even the presiding judge himself was opened, blood rose to the sky, in the bonfire Under the reflection, he squatted weakly, his body separated from the sides and slowly fell under the feet of a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This woman with a strange sword is the attacker. She is covered in a black robe and her face covers her face. In the shadow of the brim, Allexia only saw a pair of golden pupils shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another two judges rushed up, but in front of the horrible weapon, the resistance of the two was in vain. The enemy took a samurai with one sniper, and even the man with the sword opened. The loud noise comes from the moment when the weapons intersect, the sparks and debris are overflowing, and then the sound of the blade and the bones. This nightmare sound makes the blood of the female warrior almost solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a witch!" someone exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy has only one of her... The one who dares to attack the trial army by one's own power, there is no other possibility than the degenerate of the devil power! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take the gods!" There was a steady voice coming from Ellekia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and looked at Abrams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you actually want me to leave my companion and leave first?" Allahia widened her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Otherwise it will only be meaningless to die here, you still don't understand it!" He frowned and said, "The other party is not afraid of the stone of punishment. Only the supernatural has this ability. I will try to stop her, you bring the god officer to the direction of the long song fortress! Remember to take the road, and the caravan of the camp immediately called for help!" The enemy rushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superman, she took a sigh of relief. According to legend, only the gods can fight against them. When encountering an extraordinary witch, they should immediately ask for help from the local church. Eleania knew that the other person was right, and staying here would only make them sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been five teammates on the field, and the remaining trial warriors changed their strategies and used tents and terrain to fight, so that you can get a little more time. But she knows that in the face of strength and speed far superior to their extraordinary, it is only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bit her teeth, rushed into the tent, pulled the shoes that had already worn the shoes and waited for the news, and rushed to the place where the horses were riding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" asked the official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The extraordinary person attacked the camp! I must take you away!" She turned over, "Please hurry!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at night, I can’t see the road surface at all. If I rush on the winding road, it is easy to break the horse’s leg. If you jog, you will be caught up by the enemy if you can't run far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alecia decided to let the horses run down the boulevard, and they and the gods sneak into the woods on the side of the road. In the absence of fire, it is not easy to find them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collision of weapons gradually faded away. She took the hand of Mira, and identified the surrounding environment by the dim moonlight, and continued deeper away from the avenue, perhaps Will encounter a beast or a viper, but it is better than encountering a witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the two men walked to the position near the desolate mountains, Eleania was relieved, and the other party did not seem to be chasing it, except for the boring head. The birds screamed and there was silence around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do next?" asked Mila. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, she still did not seem too flustered, this calm makes Elenicia heartfelt admiration, "Adult, we can find a place here The place is to stay for one night, and wait until dawn to return to the long song fortress for support."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't go to the town to avoid the danger? Go back at least one day from here One night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Eleania shook his head. "The extraordinary person came too coincidentally. I suspect that the lord has already colluded with the witch. It is too dangerous to go to the town now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
