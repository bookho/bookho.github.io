The nightmare did not shy away from his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other for a long time, Roland replied, "Of course I can win this war - if there is another hundred years, even if you hide in the Blackrock Field, It will also be annihilated by humans. But I can't wait for so long, the warnings of God that the crisis is imminent, I have to reach the bottomless land as soon as possible, and this requires your help."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me speed up the defeat of the devil - or your west line army." Roland Starting from Erlang's legs, "such as the method of processing the stone of the gods, the power of the king and the majesty, the weakness of the spider magic, etc., this is why I took the initiative to find you. As long as you can think of -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! Wajiris took a palm on the table and the coffee spilled a little from the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be too arrogant, male!" She pressed her voice. "You can kill me, but don't expect me to beg for you. As for Let me betray the ethnic group even more! Help you defeat the Western Army? Don't dream!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dismissal!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be rude to your majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches almost sang at the same time, and the two sides were arrogant, and the atmosphere seemed to drop to freezing point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of ghost is the table?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk to the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A couple quarrel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...the number is obviously not right."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But then, the girls around him are really beautiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The peninsula More good, okay, what is this guy coming to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am envious..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Roland silently turned his eyes in the heart, clearly that the murderousness on both sides is about to overflow, what is the shadow of the wind and snow? "Okay, I am restrained." He pretended to be in a careless manner, let Felice and others first close their hands, then look down on the bench and look down on the nightmare. "You don't think that refusing to accept reality is the performance of betrayal. "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reality?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Roland’s voice suddenly sinks. "If the warning given by God is not a false statement, then there are only two ways in front of all civilizations. One is to carry out the battle of divine battle to the end, and the other is to completely end this reincarnation war through the ideology! And your choice will be What is the result, is there nothing in my heart!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not give the other party a chance to refute, he raised his voice a little, "to stay in the dream world For so long, you should also know what level I can improve the overall strength of mankind. If there is no new inheritance fragment, you can't compete with your current strength! If you have been playing for decades, how much do you want to fill in? People, how much is the price paid? Could it be that? What do you hope to see?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are also gloriously dead on the battlefield-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "No, it is dead in a meaningless lie!" Roland corrected. "And because of the existence of fragments, this war will never have a day of reconciliation. Hatred and suspicion will extend the war to the Blackrock Field." Until your ethnic group no longer exists! The only thing that can stop it from happening is me. Once I am gone, the destruction of the devil is only a matter of time. Compared with the loss of a vanguard, what kind of practice is not obvious to the ethnic group? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Wakiri's face is blue and green, without a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, our time is likely to be running low. If we miss the opportunity to end the war, then there will be no other exits." He placed the order. Legs, leaning forward slightly, "Do you still insist on your own opinion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have no better choices, one is likely to continue, the other is destined to die, nothing more." Roland slowed down. "The purpose of war has changed. What was impossible in the past does not mean that it can't be done now. As long as you think about it from another angle, both families can live."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiri's lips are closed and there is no opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has not waited any longer. "I know this is a tough choice, so I don't expect you to give a reply immediately. Go back first." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looked up incredulously, "...so?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why not? Will you tie you up and kill you directly? I said... At least for now, you are free." Roland took out his cell phone. "Right, tell me your number. This way I can go north in the first place. The war tells you that this may be good for you to make a decision - don't forget, the future of the devil is in your palm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a face Reluctant, but Wakiris still handed over the number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as it got up and ready to leave, Roland stopped it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still want to ask you a question - do you think that the "Thousand-shaped" Sistalis was wrong a thousand years ago? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris has a slight shape and left the restaurant without returning.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, do you really want to put a demon monarch to move freely in a dream?" Felice worried.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not so," Roland shook his head. "You haven't found it yet?" She is not the devil monarch once. "The devil lost the magic stone, but did not die immediately, and even had a matching identity, which can only explain a little - "now she has merged with the dream world." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is convinced of the victory of mankind, but winning in a hundred years and winning in ten years is not the same. He needs to hurt the devil in the shortest possible time. Let them completely lose the will to resist, thus clearing out a path to the bottomless world. The nightmare is just one of the cards, no matter what choice she makes, she can't change this decision.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the same moment, no one will dislike the cards in this key moment. If you can win the rebellion of a former devil, then the pressure of the first army will undoubtedly A lot less.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, time is what he is currently lacking.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The winner is -----Fiji language cold player! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哗-! "There was a burst of applause from the audience.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved to tens of thousands of spectators, then walked down the ring in the endless flash and entered the player The lounge. This is a "match" that has already been destined for the game. Even if the opponent did not follow the instructions of the guard, she still knocked it to the ground within one minute of the opening.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The previous stage does not make her feel any joy, but this time is different. Because she saw Wakiris leaving for a long time and returned to the field.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a few hours ago, the other party almost left the contest with Roland at the same time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished the clothes, Fiji went to the association bus Waiting quietly for the arrival of Wakiris.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expectation in my heart has not subsided, she has not experienced this feeling.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the other party appeared in the field of vision, she even heard the snoring of the chest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;Was Fiji’s cold expectations, Wakiris sat in the seat next to her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won today's game. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... congratulations. "Wakiris is somewhat absent-minded. This is a rare expression for her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
