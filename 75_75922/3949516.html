			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people stared at her with a big eye. After a while, the prince cleared his throat. "Those red fog is not very corrosive." Can't you get close?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is only effective for witches. According to the findings of the Quest, ordinary people, animals and plants can survive under the red fog. And the flame can speed up its dissipating." Ai Gesha bluntly said, "Don't you say that mortals can defeat the devil? Then prove it to me! The two-winged beast can be handed over to the flying witch to lead," she pointed Tilly, "the rest of the people arranged the battlefield in advance, awakened the devil, waiting for them to come from the cast network. If you really said what you said, you can easily swallow this stronghold?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smiled and shook his head. "I didn't tell you before. This investigation was done using a hot air balloon, not the flying witch you think. This kind of floating tool can only carry ten. People, I am afraid there is no way to transport ordinary soldiers. And..." He paused, " The plan was not safe. No one knows how many devils lurk in the ground. It is very likely that there will be casualties in close combat. It is also dangerous to lure the beasts. I can't let them take risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can there be a complete strategy for fighting the devil? Ai Gesha is anxious to think that every time the Shengyou Army takes the initiative to attack, everyone is killed with the determination of the war and the devil. . He is really lying to himself! In order to achieve a goal, it is normal to pay for casualties. Only those who have never experienced a brutal war will be so concerned about the life and death of the troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she was disappointed in her heart, she still restrained her emotions and did not reveal this question. By the end of the afternoon, after reading the so-called new weapons, everything will be conclusive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itâ€™s just that Gesha has no hope at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prince on paper, a group of assistant witches, and a weak and mortal mortal, even if the weapon is stronger, where can it be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the moment when the union collapsed, it was doomed to the demise of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mentioned the war of divineness many times in your words, why do you call it this way? Isn't this a war against the devil's invaders?" Roland I changed the sheet of paper and asked for the goose pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is so called, as for the reason of the war, there is no record of history." Aegusa replied with some disappointment, "said It is true that the war against the invaders is correct. The devil did come to the glory through the stone gate-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What Shimen?" The book couldn't help but interrupt . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The door to hell rising from the ground," she sighed. "Whenever the red moon of blood falls, the gates of hell will open and devour. The world we live in, this is the history book - in short, these damn stone gates will be opened every few hundred years, and the first devils came to the dawn through them, in an attempt to kill us."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The periodicity of enemy attacks is also related to this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They need red fog to survive, if When you leave the red fog range, you have to carry the storage container with you - a skin bag, a tin box or a jar made of a sinister beast. This is why we still have the opportunity to usher in the second and third battles of God. After the advent, the devil can build an obelisk that can produce red fog on its own - this black stone tower is almost higher than the mountain peak, and the spread is also very wide, almost one can cover the entire fertile plain," she said slowly. If the next war of disappointment breaks out, then it must be the devil. The center of the plain has built an obelisk, turning the plains into their homes, and then attacking you at the campsite on the edge of the red fog. This time, humans have no way to retreat."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If that's the day, everyone can go to the fjord to avoid it," Tilly shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean the islands in the whirlpool sea? How many people can feed a small land, but wait for the end of the world in despair." Gesha didn't have a good air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, everyone is happy, at least we have a general understanding of the devil now," the prince said, "wait until the third battle of gods." At the beginning, we are not unprepared. Let's go here today, and let other things go after lunch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
