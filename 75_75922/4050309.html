			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Carmela Darry left, the ashes came out of the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat on the carpet and extended her hands to Tilly. "Come on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In fact, I am fine..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No need to be reluctant, there are no other people here," Ashes interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly licked her mouth and finally moved her body and leaned back into her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the clothes, she can hear the strong and powerful heartbeat, just like the rhythm of the drums, let her feel the steady and steady power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Tilly whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't put too much pressure on yourself, even if it is wrong, we will not be able to go back to sleep on the island," Ashes chuckled. "Roland Wimbledon certainly does not Dare to stop you, otherwise the sisters of the Witch Alliance will not sit idly by." She paused. "And you don't have to say so sure, the pressure will not be as big as it is now."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five kings shook their heads. "If you want to convince others, you must first convince yourself. If I show a little hesitation and confusion, this decision cannot be carried out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she is convinced of this, it is impossible to say that there is no uneasiness. It is not a concern for Roland. In fact, when he agreed to let the sleeping charm continue to manage the migration of the witch, it shows his attitude. What she is worried about is whether the more than 300 witches who have been separated from the world for nearly two years can smoothly integrate into the winter city, and whether the ordinary people's views on the witch will change after the end of the war of gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are unknown risks and are issues that Tilly has to consider. In the eyes of others, she is always full of confidence and spirit. In fact, only a very small number of people understand her true feelings. After all, now she not only needs to take care of herself, but the fate of more than 300 people on the island is all carried by her. It can be said that after the church was defeated, all the witches on the island of sleep felt unprecedented ease, and only she felt that the responsibility of the shoulder was heavier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then do what you want," Ashes grabbed her from behind, "I will wait until the end of the evil month, and the big migration will begin. If you don't feel comfortable, take a look at these few months to get a good look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Beauty Beauty is ready to sail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Always available."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember not to forget to bring textbooks and exercise books, when you are on the road I can also learn some new knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...I will be seasick if I read a book in the cabin."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to protect me, of course, I have to be stronger, such as the legendary supernatural... How can I become stronger without reading?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash made a painful low-pitched voice, "I am fine, I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, if there is something you don't understand, I can always ask me - I haven’t stayed on board anyway. Other things can be done, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes, as you wish, Your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, there is not only one person now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the road will be, someone will be with you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Tilly said with a voice, closing her eyes and feeling the warmth behind her, and her shoulders seemed to be lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind outside the window is still the same, but the interior is warm as spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The formation of the Confederation Chamber of Commerce is a complicated process. Each contract needs to be repeatedly determined. After Roland entrusted Barov and Itis, he turned his attention to the winter combat plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
