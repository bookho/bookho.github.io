			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Georgia blinked and sometimes doubted his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked to the count of the Three Rivers, and found that the other side was also a stunned look - for a moment, all the nobles looked like Gay, which was supposed to be explosive The news, no one responded in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...not the plan! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Difficult Earl of Earl has been convinced in advance by Roland Wimbledon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his gaze to the lord of Chishui City, but the answer was whether the count’s reaction was no more than how calm they were, and the same eyes were widened. Looking at the new king with confidence. Obviously, when he arranged this dinner and invited everyone to come over, he did not know that the new king would do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Delta, the Lakeside Resort is just a routine banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others, also attended the banquet as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just Roland’s unilateral action! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He... is it crazy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think many of you already know that the system of separation has seriously hindered the flow and differentiation of people, thus restricting the development of productivity. Considering the gray castle...and even All mankind will be caught in a big crisis. I have to make a difficult decision, that is, to recover all the land and power, so that the Grey Fortress can act with the same will."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal differentiation? productive forces? Big crisis? George swallowed, what the guy is talking about? Who knows these things! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the new king does not seem to care about their ideas, and no one else continues to say, "For now, this decision is correct and necessary. Both the west and the north of the Grey Fort are successful examples. The disappearance of the divided aristocracy did not cause the local order to be lost. Instead, it became more organized. The unified decree, planning and deployment made the production of small-scale workshops from family-inherited, gradually The production of large factories has changed, and a lot of wealth has also been born. The people who actively participate in them have a lot of income. This is an indisputable fact. I think you can see the results."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that these are not intended to root out the nobility group, but to tell you that without the land and the title is not equal to nothing. Under the new system, you can get more opportunities - just Like a cake, if it is only as big as a palm, even if it is swallowed, it can only be abdomen. But if you can turn it into a table size, even if you only eat one corner, you can feel full. Since the change is good for both parties, then comprehensive promotion is not an incomprehensible thing... Many of you have already known about this matter, right?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are indeed a lot of nobles who know your intentions, but I didn’t expect you to be so acute, and George’s thoughts turned sharply. After the initial surprise, he gradually calmed down and unexpectedly discovered that the accident outside the plan was not a bad thing, but it was very beneficial to him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many aristocrats present, it is almost impossible to reach an agreement, but the contradiction has been stimulated in advance, which also saved his efforts to win the castle. After all, it is too direct to persuade the lord of Chishui City to do anything else, and it is even easier to push those who would have fallen to the Count of Delta to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, after the nobles returned, some people already said, "I’m not sure about the specific situation in the northwest. I can’t I will give you a reply in a few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this kind of thing is too big, I still have several relatives, one can't do the Lord." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hi, can you guarantee that each of us can get more wealth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In the event of a failure in change, we have not sealed the land. Doesn't it mean that the original cake was lost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your policy is absolutely wise, But... I am not the material of doing business, sire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
