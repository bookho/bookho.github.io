			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following Roland back to the office, the nightingale whispered, "I have not been able to protect you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, you are doing very well," Roland shook his head. "Think about it, why is this assassin called Siao doing it in the conference hall? Because he knows that there is witch protection around me, and the witch is extremely powerful. There is no chance at all to let her go. There are more arrangements and more flaws, so in the end he can only use a small dagger to launch an attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"But he almost succeeded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not killing me on the spot is not a success, and your presence limits this possibility." He smiled. "What would he do without you? Wait patiently for a chance to launch a deadly attack - as long as it lurks in the castle, such an opportunity will always exist. So, you have been well protected." I, in fact, the safer the territory, the safer I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not comfort ...Night thought, His Royal Highness really thinks so, which makes her feel a warm flow from her heart, and the self-blame that has been uneasy has dissipated. "I understand... but you can’t put it again this time. Lightning and wheat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what happened to them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not here At the time, the two should be on your side to beware of those potential enemies!" Night said bluntly, "For example, in today's situation, lightning can only fly you with it, the assassin is completely impossible to hurt you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is just more lively--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! If Wendy and the book are in, they will definitely agree My thoughts, if you don't let them really feel that they are wrong, what should happen next time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔..." The prince thought about his chin. After a while, "I understand, then punish them to stay in the house and not go out, how about doing three sets of mathematical and physical exercises?"<br /><b r />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night can not help but take a breath, comprehensive practice... Mathematical part is good, elementary physics and chemistry are more terrible than the basic principles of nature, just look at the previous page People are drowsy, especially those weird formulas and illustrations, and the spells in the legend are no different. If you change to yourself, I am afraid that it will never go out. However, I thought that it was my own opinion. At this moment, it was not easy to recover. Then I nodded my heart. "In this way, they should realize their mistakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon meeting continued, the night watch was behind Roland until the evening, the general framework of the secondary town hall and the first-generation candidates were finally confirmed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer Hermon was appointed CEO of Changge District, in addition to the General Manager of the City Hall, also served as Finance Minister, his father Earl of Hermon Being the Minister of Construction is the biggest winner among the fortress aristocracy. Even the nightingale secretly sighed, and His Royal Highness did not blame the assassination on the head of the honeysuckle family - this is a very fair and benevolent expression in the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heads of other departments are the outstanding ones of the small aristocrats who used to be barons or knights and are not qualified to participate in high-level government affairs. I am very excited about the appointment and dismissal of His Royal Highness, and have expressed their willingness to play for the life of His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds true to the truth at this time, but the Nightingale knows that once the situation changes and Tiffco and the church overwhelm the West, they are likely to The oath is left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the meeting, His Royal Highness repeatedly emphasized the principle of employing two people - the family can use the family, but the proportion should not exceed 30%, and the file should be sent to the superior city hall. Reporting. Another point is that regardless of whether family members are enabled or not, salaries are paid by the City Hall, and violators are criminalized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale had no interest in these contents, and he yawned again and again until she saw the wheat raft carrying the Count Sper’s flight into the long-song castle. spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dinner, the group followed the Earl of Elk to the residence of Siao, a common bungalow in the castle area, cleaned in the room. Not even a piece of paper left. Obviously the other party was prepared and destroyed all the evidence before the action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
