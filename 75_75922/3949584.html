			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell Passy will pass the two contracts after the reading, solemn Signed your name at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is the Unified Memorandum and the other is the Basic Charter of the Witch Alliance. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former agreed that after the overthrow of Tiffco Wimbledon’s rule, she led the city of Pitlong Ridge to swear allegiance to Roland Wimbledon while responding At the request of the new king, the power was turned over, and Roland should guarantee her other powers in the position of the Lord of the Dragon. In the memorandum, it is classified into three categories: personnel, administration, and finance. Although this statement is somewhat novel, it is very understandable, and it basically covers the matters that she handles daily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is a decision that Speer made after considering it for a long time. This alliance seems to be undoubtedly for the power of His Royal Highness. She didn't want to tie herself to the carriage of the Four Princes so soon, after all, the opponent currently only occupied the corner of the gray castle. But the content of the evening lectures is quite attractive, she vaguely aware that those strange calculation methods will be of great help to the management of the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirements put forward in the league’s charter are very loose. It is more like a formal consensus, not even limiting the whereabouts of members. She also asked the prince of the prince, and the answer was that she could leave at any time when she wanted to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I signed it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell handed two beautiful parchments At the table, the other party did not respond. His eyes looked at the empty side of his body, as if he was thinking about something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah..." He blinked, like a returning god Come, "I see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This state of insufficiency is hard to see in previous negotiations, it seems that after yesterday’s trial, His Royal Highness There was a hint of yellow in the eyebrows. This made her somewhat incomprehensible, and the trial undoubtedly achieved great success. People did not hesitate to stand on the side of the Highness and cheered for him. Prior to this, Speer never thought that the ordinary people would support such a nobleman as well - she thought that she and they were two worlds, and the nobles did not need the understanding of the people and did not care about their support. Yesterday, my thoughts were changed. I watched the people around the square waving their fists and making the same kind of earth-shocking voice. She realized that this might contain a power that she had never realized before. - It is even much stronger than the nobility itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and His decisive judgment is also a reason for her determination to sign the two contracts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether he wants to protect the witch, at least the thief who can punish his lord for so quickly, is in itself sincere. In this case, she should also respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, His Highness does not seem to be satisfied... Is he regretting publicly enemies against the church? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell knows that it is by no means an easy enemy to deal with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is related to the future direction of cooperation. This kind of thing is still better to ask. She hesitated and put forward her own guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highness was obviously stunned after listening, then smiled and shook his head. "I never regret to fight against the church. They are enemies that must be defeated." No matter which aspect it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I It’s just a little emotion.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sentiment?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s all true, It’s also a bit embarrassing to expose the crimes that the church has committed,” he shrugged. “It seems that he is far from being a qualified politician.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;politician? What is that, like astrologers, who focus on politics? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hasn’t had time to ask for an exit, and His Highness has stopped the topic. “I have accepted the contract. I heard that your ability is related to controlling magic?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
