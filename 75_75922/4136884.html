			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex once again saw Sinbad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first military camp area of ​​the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him to visit, there is the lively Mo Jin girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you feeling?" Murray put a bunch of seaweed on the window sill. "There are no beautiful flowers here. I can only use it instead." - But it's green, it's better than yellow sand, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...thank you," Rex quickly sat up. "I think... much better than before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, you just got caught out of the water and it looks scary, face hair Qing, twitching, still spitting the sea." She laughed. "After being sent to the camp, I started a high fever. I have been with Sinbad twice, but you didn't seem to have fully recovered consciousness at that time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex smiled a bit, "My body is really too weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But after all, you finally reached the end and surpassed your own limits.” Simbadi snorted, “Mr. Explorer. In fact, your desire to survive is stronger than I thought. When I approached the water, I almost I’ve done all my strength, if it’s not for you to hold my body, I’m afraid it’s hard to take you out together.” He picked up a corner of his clothes. “Hey, there are still a few scars here.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," Rex was a little embarrassed. "I can't remember what happened after the water hole."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time, what must you think in your heart, can you still let go without losing consciousness?" Molly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe..." He nodded. "There was a lot of things in my mind before the coma, my baby invention, the strange event, and two The wife waiting for me to go back..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere at the scene suddenly calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Simbadi tried it. "What did you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Two wives..." Rex seemed to understand. "Oh, I forgot to say that the customs of the fjord are different. The islands I live in do not have the restrictions on the number of couples. Volunteer, you don’t know this is normal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I suddenly felt... it might be a good choice to throw you in the water hole,” Simba Di gasped his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same feeling." Molly looked at her face seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you don't have to be so ruthless..." Rex saw the situation, and quickly changed the subject. "The ruins - now how? "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of business, Simbadi suddenly became serious. "Now the First Army has set the area as a restricted area. No one can enter without permission. I picked up the sentinel on the edge of the cliff, probably to guard against the giant armor. I was entrusted by them to sneak into the water hole once during the low tide and find the pocket back." His voice is getting lower and lower, "but These things were also handed over to the First Army...sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you didn't make a mistake," after listening to the other's story, Rex Gently shook his head. "Since the first army took over the treatment, you can't pass them. I don't think I can monopolize such a big relic. The only pity is that both diving suits have been destroyed. Even if the news of the success of the test is released, the degree of credibility will be greatly reduced. But that is no way. ...... After all, you are trying to save me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbad is silent, he naturally knows how much effort Rex has put into this, a waterproof suit It takes half a year to prepare, and that means only the last two finished products. How many times have you failed before, how much material and gold dragons are wasted, and you can see one or two from the constraints of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long silence, he whispered, "What do you want to do in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First return to the fjord, then come back." Rex does not Hesitatedly replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbad and Molly could not help but swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, are you worried that I will never get lost?" Looking at the two people’s slightly surprised look, Rex smiled. "If there is no escape." Experience, I probably will give up this business." He stretched out his palms, clenched and opened, as if he was feeling anything, "but I understand now, this is definitely not my limit - half a year How about a waterproof suit, how many times better than before I found out! At least I know that it will succeed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rex... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't worry, for up to two years, I will definitely come back with a new diving suit." The fjord said in a word, "When you arrive, please." Keep up with me -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that my own fears are no longer necessary, Sinbaddi thought. Just as he was ready to go down, the door was suddenly pushed open, and a man dressed as an officer came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rex? Simbadi?" He looked at the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, may I ask... Is there anything?" Simbadi hurriedly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With regard to your discovery, no winter city gives the latest instructions." The officer nodded. "Your Majesty wants to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, the king of the Grey Fort?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big and Grand Chief?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were almost surprised at the same time. They all saw incredible in each other's eyes. In just five days, the news can travel between Daqing Port and the new king of the Grey Fort. The summons of the king are somewhat beyond their imagination - in general, the superior If you want to ask the news, send someone to come. It is so serious to deal with this matter. Is the relic found to have an extraordinary meaning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, and Roland also sent a special boat to pick up the shuttle. It will arrive in Daqing Port in about two days." The officer smiled. "In that." Before, you should stay in the military camp and have a good rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sat at his desk and flipped through the reports sent back from the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any aspect, the Torch Program can be said to be going well. After entering May, the devil has barely experienced any decent resistance, and the railway line is steadily Advance in the direction of Takira. According to this trend, up to mid-June, the remains of the Holy City can enter the scope of the first army, which can be said to be ten days faster than the originally scheduled schedule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offensive is so smooth, Roland has no feeling of relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is the devil, the deadly enemy of human civilization, and has won an overwhelming victory in the past two battles of God, forcing humanity to the corner of the light. Today, the fertile plain is the last barrier. As long as the obelisk is erected, the red fog can cover the whole continent, and the enemy should be determined to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze is constantly scanning between the report and the map, hoping to find out a little clue, but there is no gain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the battle of the overnight attack, the defense of the railway station became more and more perfect, and it was only hard to destroy the camp. Although this is the place most likely to break out, it is also the most advantageous battlefield of the First Army. If the enemy chooses to fight in front, it is a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hundreds of kilometers of railway line is the second hit point - in fact, this is also the report of the crossfire with the devil, there are currently a total of forty-six . If it weren't for these reports, he would even have enemies that the enemy had already withdrawn from the fertile plains, leaving only the illusion that the Ministry of Construction was burying the railway. However, it is not easy to break the logistics in the armor of the armored train and the witch's repair, or the torch plan was made at the beginning. After the third Heihe train entered the service, even reports of harassment of the beasts were rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
