			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland received the first purchase order since the manufacture of the steam engine, and the transaction amount is by far the largest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of a "bare metal" is 500 gold dragons, two in the first month, and one in each month, a total of ten. In the future, the steam engine will need to pay extra gold for technical support, parts replacement and equipment improvement. As for the excellent after-sales service and the three-pack commitment, Roland said that he has never heard of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barov is most excited about the deal, and in his view, the act of increasing revenue for the City Hall – whether it’s trade or plunder, is worth a big deal Plus praise. Opponents are not without it. Carter, the book, and the nightingale have raised questions about this matter. It is too early to sell these powerful machines to outsiders. Now Bianzi Town is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not explain too much about this, because he did not start from the perspective of a lord, but stood in the position of industrial promoters to make this decided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost impossible to achieve the social industrialization process by one's own efforts, even if he has knowledge higher than the times. The digestive capacity of the town is extremely limited. If the manufactured industrial products are not purchased, it is no different from scrap iron. More people must be allowed to join this revolution in order to set off a wave of new power applications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can he get by selling a steam engine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ample money, a large number of jobs, and a group of skilled workers - the latter has always been the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Roland is driving down production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the evolution of Anna’s ability, productivity is no longer the same. As long as the raw materials are sufficient, she can cut a dozen steam engines in one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These products can be sold only in the simple "sell" machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drive this industry, you must form a dedicated team to be responsible for production, assembly and maintenance. In Roland's plan, he only needed to set up a factory to prepare production tools, such as trampolines, planers, milling machines, etc., and put the steam engine production to the workers. It can be expected that the production efficiency of the factory will be low in the early stage, and the product qualification rate will be unbearable, but slowly, everything will be on the right track. There is a mother bed blessing that Anna has personally built. As long as the operation is familiar, the output will inevitably rise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to use the profits of the selling machine to expand production scale and train more skilled workers. Experienced old workers give the town the ability to produce higher-quality products such as steam trains, steamships and more. There is no doubt that this is a virtuous circle. And those steam engines that are sold can also indirectly create benefits for themselves - the other side can be used for mining, which can reduce the price of ore; for shipping, it can promote trade; for textiles, it can make up for its shortcomings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolandba can't quickly spread steam power all over the country - as long as these machines are produced from Bentham Town. Once he unifies the gray castle, he can save a lot of work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also considered the possibility of a buyer copying a steam engine, but the new steam engine will use a circular cylinder drilled by a boring machine, plus some deliberately designed complex parts, relying on At the current state of the art, I am afraid that it is difficult for them to produce qualified machines in a short period of time, even if they have high-temperature types of witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can talk about such a large order, and find a channel to sell industrial products, it should be a heart-wrenching, Roland found that he has no pleasant mood . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The outside has been cleared, why are you still suffering from a face?" The night squats on the desk and holds a dish in his hand. Dried fish slices, "Is still worrying about the news of the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the book is not in the night, the behavior of the nightingale will become very casual, the corner of the desk and The loungers on the wall are the places she often stays at. For other lords, this move is obviously an offense, but Roland knows that he does not care, and she is equally aware of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have been wondering why the church wants to support me and Garcia for the throne at the same time. I probably want to understand now. If I guess it is correct, I am afraid Feike also received an invitation from the church." He frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
