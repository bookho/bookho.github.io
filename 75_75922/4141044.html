			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the conscious world gradually dissipated, Heckzod opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of it is an inflated hall with a calm misty sea below and no end to the top of the head. Nine different sizes of cantilevered cantilevered in the middle of the air, forming a circle along the vertical stone wall. In the center of the circle stands a huge tower of birth, but unlike the real tower, it is covered with a single eye, each with its original size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the area that Wang created. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave the Holy See." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the first time to enter this place, but the body still subconsciously feels depression and uneasiness - unlike simple spiritual communication, this piece is in the confusion of consciousness The virtual image space created in the stream is not a real "illusion". If it falls into the fog or is attacked, it will also be substantially harmed, rather than waking up like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the chaos of the outside, the order is orderly and the rules are strict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king holds everything in the Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means that as long as you enter the dominion of the Holy See, its life and death are in the hands of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But its loyalty to the king should be absolute, and the instinctive contradiction does not attract resentment - only the lower beasts can not restrain the instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your call, the Lord of the Sky greets you." Heckzod bowed his head at the tower in the middle of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One eye opened it and glanced at it, then quickly closed it, "waiting with peace of mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, several figures appeared in other seats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look a bit fuzzy, but Heckzod can still identify the identity of the other person from his characteristics, such as the armor is full of various weapons, the body is like A hill-like "blood conqueror" and a mask of clothing are full of distorted feelings of "a disgusting heart"... How much can be expressed depends on how much you understand the source of magic, and like it can There are only a handful of complete displays of themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the figure appeared on the last chair, it means that the nine Maharajas have gathered to dominate the Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real image of the king - the tower of the birth that rose from the sea of ​​fog also slowly opened half of the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason why I summon you, I think you all know - not just me, everyone should have the same question. A few days ago, there was a promotion It touched the conscious world and set up a shackle there, but soon it no longer responded." It paused and looked at the owner of the sky. "And the owner of the scorpion is called Erskuk, which happens to be the pioneer of the West Line. The commander of the army - Heikezod, what happened in the west?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, Wang came for this problem. Heckzold suddenly felt the pressure on his body soared, and the ability to rise in the conscious world meant that someone crossed the extraordinary threshold, and this breakthrough was also felt by all the monarchs. In the increasingly fierce battle with the Tianhai world, more than one Maharaja can bring greater advantages to the ethnic group, but the next turning point is unprepared, the promoters only left a mark, and then disappeared. There is no trace of it - Dajun has just fallen into promotion, which is the first time in hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Heckzod received the news of the defeat of the Western Front shortly after he perceives the breakthrough of the other party, and there is also an Erskuk Self-reported letter. The content of the letter made it want to take the head of this outstanding man for a moment, to see if this guy had a problem, it would be like this to the point! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wang asked, he instinctively wanted to hide the results of the Western Front, but loyalty finally let it tell the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Lord of the Sky predicted, there was a voice of doubt, surprise, and sarcasm in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
