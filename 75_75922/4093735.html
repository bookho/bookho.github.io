			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the last sentence, Roland couldn’t help but tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there a battle of divineness in the world of dreams? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Garcia, the latter’s look was unchanged, and he didn’t know if he knew this or didn’t care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland had to suppress the doubts in his heart, and follow the crowd to follow the crowd to the square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, he discovered that there are many honeycomb-shaped passages embedded in the towering stone walls, whether they are entering from the ground or transporting between the passages. Take the elevator that is suspended from the rails. Before the square was lit, I didn't think it was. Now that the view is dim, dozens of elevators that run up and down like a floating firefly, which makes people feel like they are in a future city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this design looks beautiful, but it is extremely inconvenient to use. If it is built in the city center as a landmark, it will be considered. Who is going to be buried under the ground? Look? In the event of an emergency such as a fire or power outage, the escape does not know where to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, building the headquarters on the ground itself is a violation of common sense, and it is simply impossible to prevent others from invading or confidentiality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not for the martial arts associations to spend more money, there must be other reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the 24th passage, Roland found that the ground under his feet was also a transfer ladder, and he could advance automatically as long as he stood still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of handwriting is simply amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiacia seems to have seen his doubts and shrugged. "It used to be a mine. The elevator passage on the wall used only those abandoned mines." The road is only – and of course some of it is newly excavated, depending on the speed of erosion.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Erosion occurs in the mine?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inaccurate, but you can think so for the time being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the association is to prevent erosion from spreading out. "Building the headquarters on the ground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia reveals a strange look. "No, there is nothing to stop the erosion from expanding. The headquarters is not eroding, but Those who are not well-intentioned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See what Roland wants to ask, she shook her head gently. "When you see it, you will understand." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The channel quickly led the group to another hall, which was quite a bit like a tiered meeting room, ground Layer dropping, until the bottom to form a lectern. The defense measures here are obviously much stricter. The martial arts homes wearing the same costumes can be seen everywhere. They stand on the sides of the hall with no expression on their faces, staring indifferently at the newcomers who have just arrived, and have no welcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking that a good martial artist is straightforward and enthusiastic? Roland is in his heart, so he treats the awakened by the new entry. No wonder people don't want to join. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After everyone was seated, the chief disciple once again boarded the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t say a word, she opened a curtain on the stage and revealed the huge glass box below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can't help but frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a dark red "crystal" in the box, suspended in the center like no weight, which reminded him of the magic core of Takira . But the power of nature in the dream world is not as powerful as the magic, and the crystal has almost no substantial sense. It is a bit like a poor sample made with 3D projections, and you can look at the serious look. It’s not like joking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Erosion," Garcia said, "or Say "vulnerabilities." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is only a small part of it on the stage,” she sighed. “Our world is becoming riddled with holes, which is the essence of erosion.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I think, some of you have already guessed it, or you have felt it--" He swept the audience and said word by word, "There is an evil force that has entered our world, and it has made the devil The endless stream has seriously threatened the safety of the awakened. But I want to say that this concept is wrong, there is never any evil power, it is just... a superposition from another world."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience suddenly lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean? Can you make it clear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is another world? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When did the martial arts association change the Academy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sorcerer What are the aliens?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a completely different performance from the real newcomers, those who have long awakened the power of nature do not care about the identity of the other chief disciple, directly Loud it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silence," I don't want to move. "If there is anything, wait until you see the next show."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her words, the glass box slowly rises and exposes the "crystal". Then there were three hanging rods on the top of the podium, and each camera was hung on the top of the pole. At the same time, the wall behind the beak was also lit up - it turned out to be a huge screen with three different angles. , from three cameras. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland quickly noticed a phenomenon that made his scalp numb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the direction in which the camera was shot, the irregular crystal always showed a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't this be a perfect sphere? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are horny things that represent discontinuous changes. The visual appearance must be different from each other, but he is not in three. In the picture, I found a trace of turning, as if it was not an object, but a piece of erythema on the screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brain has subconsciously discerned it as a virtual image, and the crystal itself does not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the next move made Roland feel surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw that the chief disciple took over an iron bar handed by an assistant and inserted it straight into the red crystal. The stick did not penetrate the shadow as he expected. But disappeared directly in front of everyone. Through the screen, you can see that the three cameras faithfully restored the original appearance of the iron rod. The traces on the polished surface are clearly identifiable, and the angle is completely no problem. The erythema remains as it is, just like the three iron rods are different. Angle... penetrated into the same place in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he pulled it back, the stick in his hand was a bit less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall is quiet and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of such a vision, everyone is silent, as if an invisible hand has caught their mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, someone stood up and said, "Can I go on stage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Please." Nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man went to the podium and stared at the red crystal for a long time, suddenly sighed and reached out to grab it - his skin was lightly colored with silver Light, clearly is the use of the power of nature. The warriors who can do this step can't be underestimated. Roland once heard Garcia say that driving the force of nature to the outside is, to a certain extent, close to the demon, and ordinary weapons can't be hurt. If you want to practice this kind of skill, you are not a talented person, or a life-and-death struggle that has been going through many years, far stronger than the average martial artist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the capital of their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
