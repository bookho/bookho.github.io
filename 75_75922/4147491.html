			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need to expand an ammonia plant and a soda plant. Should you be ready already?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before both of these were stuck on the catalyst, they have been solved by the ability of Ai Gesha and white paper, and the output has always remained at a level that is not high or low. . It is much higher than the original saltpeter acid method, but it is limited by the magic and population of the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the complete periodic table of elements has been completed, the chemical laboratory immediately put the primary task on the establishment of sample specimens, with the separation of elements from Lucia, chemical The Department has now mapped the elements on the table with the actual specimens one by one. This makes some relatively rare materials no longer unfamiliar, such as the catalysts commonly used in industrial nitric oxide - platinum, rhodium and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps in terms of efficiency, it is better than Ai Gesha and white paper, but as long as there are people, how many factories can be built. The so-called quality is not enough, but the former does not have any witchcraft and quantity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said Kay Moss. "We have technically verified its principle and created a small reaction dish to simulate the process of synthesis." As long as there are enough people, they can start construction at any time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can give you literacy immigration priority, and then prepare after the meeting." Rolandton Dunton, "In addition, I plan to open a new production line for the manufacture of lead-acid batteries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Chemicals did not reveal the slightest color, others may not Know what this is, but he has already turned the books of the primary and middle chemistry into a familiar, all content is in mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a popular saying of lead-acid batteries, which is the battery. The materials used are extremely simple, only lead, lead dioxide and dilute sulfuric acid are needed. It is not difficult for the alchemy association. What's more, the current Ministry of Chemical Industry â€“ lighting with an electrolyte solution is a very classic test of high school chemistry. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of the battery is that it can be recharged and used, just add some pure water every other time. The difficulty in manufacturing lead and lead dioxide sheets is close to zero. Previously, there was no production because of the narrow use and the low priority in the case of insufficient population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The amount you need is probably..." Kemer took out a small book and recorded it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One hundred days is enough for a month." Roland replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battery is mainly used for the cold start of the piston machine. As the most dazzling industrial crown without the winter city, the two-wing aircraft has to let the ground shake for a long time when it takes off. There are disqualifications. Before that, there were not enough people. Now, no winter has been supplemented by a large number of migrants. Naturally, it is not necessary to be so constrained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people can do whatever they want. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The amount of the factory can be completed by a dozen newcomers," said Kamo. "Of course, the manufacturing needs of components such as lead plates and outer casings." The help of His Royal Highness Anna."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can provide detailed drawings, the Ministry of Industry has no problem." Anna nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then Rongchen thinks for a few days and then sends the drawings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland satisfactorily After drinking tea for a few years, now that the Executive Department has talented people and cross-departmental cooperation has become the norm, this has led many new projects to start with, and then someone will finish it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next is the task of the Ministry of Industry-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the Battle of Takira His brain has a lot more to be improved and supplemented, and at this point he can finally let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that is urgently needed is to improve the combat capability of the infantry squad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called general machine gun program. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replicating the Mark 1 heavy machine gun with a lighter material and optimizing its structure so that the gun body and the gun frame can be separated and carried by a single person. Use a sling or a clip so that any enemy can be attacked at any time. Even if the opponent is a high-level devil, as long as it is not suddenly attacked, it can provide fire suppression and create opportunities for the anti-magic grenade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
