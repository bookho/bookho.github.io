			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the first explosion rang, Danny had already jumped out of bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the top of the head, there was a gust of slamming, and there was constant mud and debris falling, as if the entire residence was crumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it an earthquake?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same robes have also awakened from their dreams, and the room where they could not reach the five fingers suddenly became confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is an enemy attacking us!" The nearest soldier from the door grabbed the rifle and reached for the door, but Danny was stunned. On the ground. "What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't mess, the attack is not over yet!" Danny whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, several explosions came from far and near, and there was a series of rainy muffles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, damn, that is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust is flying, someone Lighted up the fire candle. When the faint candlelight dispels the darkness, everyone can't help but breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of sharp black long needles on the raised roof. Under the swaying fire, it was like a cold hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spider Devil..." was swallowed by Danny’s stunned, and most of the members of the Precision Shooter team participated in the first expedition. No stranger to this enemy. He obviously also thought about it. If you just rushed out of your residence, what would happen if you met the curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I can go back alive, I must buy two leg of lamb and go to the door to thank Miss Lian." Another person patted the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the usual habit of fighting, the temporary station is usually a tent, but this time it was changed to a clay kiln built by a witch - although I don’t know if it is In this regard, there is no doubt that this measure has played a key role. If they are still cloth tents, they are afraid that they are already riddled with holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say this unlucky, I am still waiting to get married."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You guy, just want to deliberately close with Miss Lian!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What nonsense, the set is also the set of Nana Wa Angels." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they have only been separated from life and death, no one has been affected by this sudden sneak attack, even if they keep talking, weapons and ammunition They have already reached the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously this group of people understands the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death cannot escape, it is either already coming or has not yet arrived. Since you can still think about this problem, it proves that it is not yet dead. Instead of worrying about fear, it is better to do something first—such as killing an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the camp gradually boiled, Danny pushed the door open and the cat rushed out of the kiln house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several sentinels that had been pierced at the entrance to the barracks, and there was no breathing. At the moment, there are almost everywhere sounds - people shouting, gunshots, explosions, and devil's jealousy. No one knows where the enemy is and how many. The tower that was originally used to indicate the direction does not light up, it seems The enemy is the same as it appears in the camp in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He climbed up the roof and watched for a moment and found a spot where the gunshots were the most sparse, no matter what the teammates shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you would go to the place with the most people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of malt is Laughter in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why he likes to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That means we are dominant, and I am just a icing on the cake," Danny replied. "The intermittent gunshots mean that someone is in a hard fight, and my bullets can bring redemption."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said it, it is not your fault - you can't save everyone on the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "But I can at least save everyone I see." He smiled. "Don't worry, I think it's so good, it allows me to see you more clearly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Danny turned his head away, and surely the familiar face emerged from the darkness, and he was running along the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approaching the battle site, he found the commanding heights - a dozen iron boxes stacked freely climbed up. As the line of sight suddenly became clear, he noticed that it was close to the fortress position, and several devils were using the bunker and the artillery who had arrived. Obviously, the artillery lacking heavy weapons is not dominant. It is impossible to suppress the enemy, and it is difficult to snatch the position under the spear of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the barracks to the artillery, several people were pierced by bone spears and fell into a pool of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did they come here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, but they are good The days are coming to an end," Danny took a long shot and pointed at a devil who stalked the barracks from the side. If you get it, I am afraid that there will be a gust of wind and rain in an instant. The latter is completely unaware that someone has pointed the gun at it, and the entire body is completely exposed to the scope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not hesitate to pull the trigger, and the other side suddenly raised a red mist and fell off the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if only the moonlight illuminates him, he will never miss a distance of 100 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s beautiful. Pay attention to the left and someone has to act.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See only five or six The soldier squatted in the corner of the wall and moved to the edge a little bit. He saw that the posture seemed to be desperately trying to get into the position with the spear of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The courage is commendable, but the skill is zero, there is no cover shooting, you can't run the spear." Danny raised his mouth slightly, "so still How about?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shot three shots quickly and hit the other’s feet – the sudden splash of dust and bullets screamed the soldiers Jump, just stepped out and took it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will be killed by them like this." Malt worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahahaha," Danny finally laughed. "That must let them have a life to swear." He happily turned his gun and put the group The daring daring of the outcrop is a little bit. The enemy who had the potential to break into the camp was completely suppressed for a time, and did not dare to show up easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the air broke again in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beware, look there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the reminder of malt, several black shadows descend from the sky , straight into the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰!砰!砰!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact sound is so large that even the ground is slightly Trembling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the moonlight, Danny was surprised to find that it turned out to be a few huge black stone pillars! And after landing, there was a burst of red mist around the stone pillars, accompanied by a leaking sizzling sound, quite like a steam engine under the arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly knew that it was not a machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three slabs are peeled off from the thick column, and the shovel brings out a large pool of "blood water" - the column is divided into three petals, each There is actually a devil in the petals! They are wrapped in fresh capsules, like babies immersed in the mother. And when the scarlet liquid drained, they also woke up, revealing a sly tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the enemy has not walked out of the Blackrock Column, and a bullet has penetrated exactly one of the maddened heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
