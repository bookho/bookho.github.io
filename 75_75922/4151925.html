			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, is the dress changed?" Outside the locker room, the spirit asked, "If you need my help, please be welcome."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, I... very soon." After the partition, there was a slightly nervous voice in the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows, this is the first time he saw the book revealing such uncertain emotions. In the past, she was always shocked, no matter what Everything is calm and adds. This also made him look forward to the look of the book after a new dress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“哗啦—”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The partition was pulled open, and the book carefully walked from the locker room Come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So...can you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suddenly felt bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a slim blue turtleneck sweater inside the book, which perfectly showed the contours of the upper body. On the outside is a black and red embellished half-length robes. The robes start from the lower part of the shoulders and extend to the calves, quite a bit of evening dress. The chest is open, with the inverted V-shaped at the waist, the towering chest and the flat belly line are half-hidden, at first glance, there is an indescribable beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall top is decorated in dark tones, without any contempt, but rather solemn. Adding the pair of black-rimmed glasses on the face of the book and the black bun on the waist and the waist, it adds a few mature and intellectual beauty to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s beautiful," Felice exclaimed. "Even if it’s in a witch, it’s enough to be praised."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that I chose it right!" The spirit was quite proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...will it be too exposed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book will subconsciously cover up On the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where, isn't this wrapped up tightly?" Farn laughed. "You can accept the dress at the party, let alone this set." Improved winter clothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And in the world of dreams, everyone wears it like this, I am right, squat?" The spirit followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head with a chuckle, even though there were underwear and long sweaters inside, but the top and bottom slits were more than the robes she often wore. It does have something that is not very suitable. "The key is not how other people wear it, but the book's own opinion." He paused and looked at the book. "Do you think you like this suit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The book looks at the self in the glass mirror - that is what she has never seen before, even if the two worlds are very different, but this kind of thing can always cross countless divides, causing people's hearts Resonance. She can't admit it, she likes the dress now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes... Your Majesty." She whispered back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it." Roland called the shopping guide. "This set is all I want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., you have a real eye, these are the latest models this winter, and this lady is a perfect match!" The guide took out the calculator for a while, "a total of 24,000 yuan Please come here for payment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃-" Roland's breathing has been stagnant for a moment, which is almost equivalent to one-third of the price of the van. However, Haikou has already boasted that it is too late to retreat. He looked to the spirit. "How do you choose when you choose clothes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The number on the label is big!" The spirit spit out his tongue. “The students in the school said that only the price in this world would not lie.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, these clothes...is expensive?" asked the book and whispered, "If you don't even..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three goddess of witches unanimously cheered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello...test?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured," Roland waved his hand, "here The time flow rate is faster, so the actual delay can not be long, not to mention that you are the first time to come to the dream, of course, you must first enjoy enough to say what you want to eat, even though!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, the big heads have already come out, and then how to eat and how much can not be spent, simply let everyone happy, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book looked at the four people who were uplifted and shook their heads with helplessness and laughter. "I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you came out of the bustling shopping mall, everyone was already eating and drinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Roland’s leadership, the group of people almost swept all the food and beverage outlets and saw that there was a good point to pick up – from the heat Crab yellow packets, to the ice cream mixed with nuts, each is very delicious for the book. Although some foods are not available in the winter city, compared with the rest of the food, it is almost the same as the small cars and steam trucks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if she tries to control herself, she just keeps a good meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This world... It’s so good..." Strolling through the spacious streets, the scrolls snarled in the night sky. Even if the stars have been covered, the city is still shining. A street lamp illuminates the street, and the snow flies under the soft light, like an elf that adorns the night. “The city is both glamorous and bright, and everyone on the face is filled with a smile. It looks like a dream... Can we build the reality into this way one day?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, as long as we have enough knowledge," Roland said with a hand on his back. "This is also the biggest difference between the two sides - Bianbu Town can be transformed into a winter city without knowledge, so there is no winter city. One day it will become a dream world. The key to unlocking this process is now in front of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My...before?" It’s awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Roland raised his lips. The reason for bringing the book here is not just for shopping. After crossing the road, the group stood in front of a beautiful building. I saw a golden plaque hanging at the gate, which read the five characters of the "City Library." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the museum, the book can not help but marvel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spacious hall is the size of the central square without the winter. It is directly above the roof of more than ten meters high, like a transparent patio. The escalators that run automatically around the area carry people up and down, while the five-storey corridors are stacked around the hall. The countless bookshelves are lined up, and each shelf is full of books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the books of the entire Grey Fortress...even the four kingdoms are added, and they are not comparable to the collections here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book involuntarily put his hand on his chest, she obviously understands why she brought her here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This will be a place you will always come in the future." Roland smiled. "Take the key to the world for me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath and bowed down to Roland, solemnly saying, "The book will not live up to your entrustment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This is destined to be a long and time-consuming task, and it is difficult to see any results in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the change has always started from such a small place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge is like nourishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you scatter, you can catalyze people to grow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been promoting the progress of this matter, and it is also for this purpose to send Ling and others to the school, and the promotion of the book will undoubtedly accelerate this. a process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
