			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“嘶嘶嘶嘶呷—————!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four Wings A screaming scream, probably did not expect the other party will take the initiative to send the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can’t wait to open the beak, don’t avoid it, and bite straight to Luojia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then everyone saw this shocking scene! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia instantly changed into a huge desert wolf, a slap in the face of a strange bird, the power is like a thunder! The entire head of the eagle headed to one side, and the hook mouth that was enough to pick up an adult suddenly changed shape in this shot. The first half even broke open and flew out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, it is too late for the hybrid to adjust the posture. The two behemoths slammed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia spurted out another blood, but the three feet were holding on to each other, and the fangs also bite into the flesh of the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden increase in weight. The evil beast apparently realized that the big thing was not good, and he was desperately waving his wings, trying to lift the height again. But the desire to carry a wolf woman who is equal to himself is no doubt far beyond its ability. No matter how the wings are shaken, the two giant beasts continue to fall down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andreia!" Ashes shouted at the companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know you have to rely on me to end," Andrea threw the rifle back to the echo, jumped to the high platform with the run, and summoned the magic longbow . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, a wolf and a bird also fell heavily to the high platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white flash of light, the desert wolf on the four-winged eagle suddenly disappeared without a trace, the ashes know that Luo Jia has either exhausted the magic, or Lost consciousness. However, this step can be achieved, and the outcome is a foregone conclusion. She directly stripped off the robe of a samurai warrior who died, and rushed toward the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because close, I noticed that there are many scattered wounds on the back of the evil beast and the carapace of the abdomen, some are scratches, and some are small holes. There are also green mucus and silk blue blood inside. These wounds should be left by the First Army, but none of them can cause fatal damage to the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash found the three princesses who were stuck in the gap of the wings and held her down the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Guangzhong, she saw that the longbow in the hands of Andrea had blossomed into a dazzling golden mans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mixed species of evil spirits swayed their heads and swayed from the ground, only to find that the side of the body seemed to glow a golden sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, where are you looking?" Andrea smiled and said, "Fly fly again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;“嘶吼————!” At this time, it came back to God, panicked and opened its wings to escape, but it was too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of invisible rays of light burst out from the magical bow, with a thunderous whistling sound into the evil body - in an instant Numerous golden light emerges from its body, like a blazing blaze from the shell, engulfing it in the glow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the roar, a circular gap of several meters wide appeared in the center of the high platform, and the burly four-winged eagle had only a small torso lying in the gap. On the side, the minced meat is scattered like a raindrop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this fleshy rain, Andrea is proud, and the golden lingering bowstrings illuminate her long hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing with the longbow, are you wasting magic?" The ashes under the stage did not stand up in good spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, let the people here remember my powerful appearance... ah, hey," she said halfway suddenly grabbed her mouth. You seduce me to talk, what to do if the minced meat falls into the mouth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
