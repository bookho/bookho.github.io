			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first rain after entering the winter has finally fallen, and it is two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland leaned against his desk and looked out at the town outside the window. The rain was rolled up by the wind, and one by one was shot on the glass, causing ripples. Under the refraction of the ripples, the outline of the town becomes distorted. The extension of the house and the street is curved and deformed, and it will not be the regularity of the past. Due to the lack of effective drainage measures, the water flowing across the staggered stone roads is far from the river, and looks like a lot of rippled creeks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountains and forests in the distance are covered by water mist, looming like a human world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the scenery is modern, it is definitely a tourist attraction, and now Roland wants to see the steel and cement jungle. The construction of the city wall had to stop when it rained, which made him a little bit fascinated by the joy of the last day to "persuade" the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You just said that the air around us is made up of many gases, really?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The clear voice interrupted Roland’s thoughts, and Anna asked with her pretty blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, Miss Anna, you should use honorific words when you call your Highness," the chief knight on the side reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not so particular," Roland turned and said, "She is now my student." With nothing to rain, he put two witches and Carter. Calling to listen to his class - yes, he decided to open a natural science popularization class. The work of the stone craftsman Carl School inspired him, even the stonemason can open the school, not to mention his own mechanical engineering dog. Why is there discrimination, is it because of ignorance? Universal education is the most effective means of promoting the development of civilization in any era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally wanted to call the assistant to the minister, but the other party was busy with government affairs recently, and the rumor declined. Somehow, Roland felt that Barov was particularly motivated after the winter, and almost one person provoked the daily management of Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing new knowledge to learn, Anna immediately became radiant and her eyes seemed to glow. Nana Wa saw that she didn't need to treat all kinds of experimental animals, and she was very happy. Carter was holding a pair of idle and idle, and came to listen to you with a good look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not long after the class started, the knight’s eyes were gone. Nana Va is also ignorant, staring at the words of nature and science. Although Anna seems to understand half of it, she still tries hard to write down everything she hears. Roland had to pause and let the three men digest for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Anna’s question, he smiled and nodded, “Of course, although they look the same.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;" Your Highness, I don't understand, since it looks the same, how do you know that it is a different gas?" Carter questioned this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can prove it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows that if light is spoken in words, I am afraid that most people will be confused by these mysterious and mysterious theories. He decided to use a simple experiment to arouse everyone's interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A candle, a glass, a tub, a bowl of clarified lime water - this is what he prepared in advance, despite the glass at this time The cup is light brown, far less transparent than the later beakers, and it is enough to use it barely. After all, this simple test does not require observation of the change process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has done it beforehand. The test results prove that although the world has magic, the rest of the natural rules are still the same as the earth. He asked Anna to light the candle and stand it in the tub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Combustion requires the consumption of a gas, which is also closely related to all life. If we stop breathing, it will be like this candle. Look," Roland The glass was buckled on the candle, the flame was shaken twice, and it was quickly extinguished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It runs out of air, Your Highness, this is not surprising," the chief knight did not take it for granted. "Without the air we will of course die, such as falling into the water." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
