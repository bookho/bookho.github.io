			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two returned home, and the film shook his head helplessly. "You can't think about answering your Highness for a few days?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost jumped and walked when he saw his wife coming back. The last time I saw her so happy, I am afraid it was still at the wedding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," Elaine spit out, "I will not sleep in the evening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Also, she is so fond of drama, often in the theater at the Fortress Theatre, and often with her own lines. If it weren't for the Duke, she should have changed from a theater flower to a veritable theater star. Thinking of this, he gently hugged his wife from behind, "I'm sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Irene patted his head, "Not your fault, At that time, you were transferred to other cities and there was no way to stop him.” She smiled softly. “If you want to apologize, go cook, I want to see the script first.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I will do it." Film kissed her earlobe, "meat porridge and fried egg, plus a sausage to celebrate."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many homes Many of the layouts are different from the homes he used to know, such as cooking stoves, in the long song fortress, whether aristocrats or civilians, will repair an open hearth in the center of the main living room. Instead of a new home, separate a room for the stove. The stove is surrounded by three sides and the back is connected to the chimney. The passageway is provided with a baffle that can move laterally. When not in use, it can be closed by pushing it in order to prevent the smoke from the downstairs from coming out of the stove. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling can easily think of the benefits of this design. After closing the door, the living room can be protected from cooking fumes and odors, and the indoor temperature can be effectively reduced in summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stove was filled with firewood and sawdust, and the flames were raised. He began to concentrate on making the dishes tonight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eating dinner, Irene continued to devote herself to the script, almost until the bottom of the candle, she put down the third book, a long breath . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" The film couldn’t help but be curious. What kind of script made her spend so much time reading, knowing that when she was in the theater, She can read through dozens of such thick books in half a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really...indescribable," Irene sighed. "Every book is full of new ideas. I have never seen such a story! Cinderella." In the prince, the prince likes not a princess, but a beautiful civilian girl... This is not surprising, but he insisted on taking a civilian. He even wondered if the prince saw this story. Willn't you be dissatisfied with the absurd and bizarre content inside? Aside from this, the whole story is exciting, especially when the prince once again finds Cinderella and puts on the crystal shoes for her, I can't help but want to be them. Applause.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Midnight Chicken” is also very interesting, much simpler than Cinderella, I think about two or three scenes will be The story is clear, and the serfs have the courage to fight against the aristocrats. This description is very exciting. After a long preparation, the serfs are fully presented with the unbearable feelings of tolerance. Finally, the sense of eruption when rebelling is decided. People feel very hearty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The serf against the aristocracy?" Film frowned, but this is something that the nobility can't tolerate. If the serfs in the Sirte Manor dared to fight against the owner with a hoe and a shovel, they were afraid that their father would erect their heads at the gate of the manor the next day. "Is it true that Your Highness wants you to perform this kind of drama?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's you didn't read the script," Irene glanced at him. "Read Then you will feel the same feeling with me. Standing up and resisting is a last resort. The little aristocrats are simply deceiving too much. In the face of the persecution of human life, they still just put the nobility on the bag and smashed it. I I felt that I had been very restrained. Later, the nobles wanted to kill the serfs, and a passing witch saved them. She became the image of a well-known local aristocrat who stopped the bad guys and went to the lord's castle to plead for the serfs. The lord debated It made a wise and benevolent decision - he bought the serfs and then promoted them to the free people! I bet the audience will be cheered when they play here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the nobles will definitely protest, and the film does not think so, and then the theater will be under pressure from the nobility, and finally disband the crew... Wait, he suddenly realizes that Bianbu Town In addition to mentioning the ancient son His Royal Highness the Prince and outside, there is no other nobles, while the latter is the formation of the crew people. In other words, these dramas that His Royal Highness is required to perform are really only intended to be watched by the general public? Can not earn a few copper eagle from their hands. If you pay the salary according to the level of the fortress theater, this is at the expense of buying and selling. Isn’t your Highness just for self-entertainment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
