			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the Ministry of Agriculture to raise rubber worms is not a temporary rise of Roland. As an important industry that is comparable to oil, it is better to master it by yourself. If he is not worried about the potential threat of these insects, he does not want to set up the farm in the third side of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the refusal of the lord, it is the result of discussions with Barov, Itis and others - compared to the witch empire that rules mankind, the female lord It is easier to be accepted than to destroy the city state. Nowadays, people who know the battle of gods and the truth of Takira are limited to the upper floors of the city hall and some of the first army backbones. This is very unfavorable for propagating the upcoming war, but it is easy to cause panic when it comes out, so it is modified and revealed a little. To give everyone some psychological buffer space, it is a good compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure the stability of the united front, he even wanted to bury the black history of the witch empire forever. If human beings can win in the battle of gods, and when archaeologists rediscover the lost record, people should no longer be entangled in this special period of history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elk knight was thrown into the wormhole, and after he studied it himself, Roland was invited by Pasha to the center of the underground hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are back, kneel down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Face this no headless In the last sentence, Roland couldn't help but pick an eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passa did not answer, but raised the tentacles, making a mysterious point to the deep passage on the side of the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked down and saw a faint white shadow in the black lacquered passage, and in a short while, two huge worms swallowed the worm from the cave. Drilled in the middle, twisted his body and came to him, opened the bloody mouth full of hooks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, do you remember us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them makes a cheerful voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is a little glimpse, "Jasmine...and Lyra?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He certainly won't So forgetting the names of the two so soon, the scene of the day of separation is still fresh in memory. After calmly saying that he did not regret, he boarded the cement ship to Daxueshan. Now from their tone of voice, they can still feel the unchanging determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, you really remember!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Note polite!" Another tail Squeezing out the partner, "Even if the body is different, don't forget that we are Taqila..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Worm?" Jasmine deliberately said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witch!" Lyra screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They just arrived in the winter city, because they wanted to see you before going to sleep, I had to wait for them to wait at the main hall, I hope there is no surprise. To you." Pasha hangs down the Lord, "Tachella once again thank you for your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I have been waiting for the conversion to be successful. The news," Roland waved his hand in disapproval. "Just... why do you want to sleep?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the worm carrier is too expensive, squat." In the normal color, "the usual excavation and transportation work Fran can be done by one person. It is not necessary to maintain the existence of three carriers at the same time. Before coming here, even if Fran is always in a dormant state."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because before the conversion, she and Jasmine have more lively temperament, but now they feel a lot more mature, as if the moment of the soul transfer, let her really grow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Felix and others for a long time, Roland knew that not every Taqila witch had spent such a long time. At first they lacked the carrier, and did not slay the samurai shell, or chose to merge with Eleanor, one of the three seats, or transfer it to the soul container and enter the unconscious sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that there are only a handful of witches who have gone through hundreds of years, and itâ€™s a later event when the church is built and the body is provided for them. ... Felic has changed her body twice, and the time to stay awake is only about 150 years old. I have to remove the initial and incomprehensible adaptation period, and this is already considered by the people. "Elderly". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
