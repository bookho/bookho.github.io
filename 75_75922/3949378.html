			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the Witch Alliance!" In the hall, a group of different ages and colorful witches toasted and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, thank you." Lucia felt hot and hot. She sucked her nose, resisted the urge to tears, and lifted the cup to drink. Under the ale - not as bitter as the memory, but with a little sweetness in the scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing the lord, with the help of the nightingale, she took a hot bath and bell and put on a clean suit. Settled his sister, Lucia returned to the castle hall with the nightingale. Here, the witches hosted a welcome banquet for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time Lucia saw so many similarities, the last bit of doubt in my heart also dissipated. If the witch is imprisoned here or forced to work for the lord, it is impossible to reveal such a brisk and bright smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the phrase "here is the home of the witch", she suddenly had a feeling of empathy, compared to those who were exposed to identity and were chased by the church. Witch, how hard it is to have a safe and comfortable place to live. Since Jin Suicheng was attacked by mobs, she has exhausted the pains of running around for more than a month. The warm welcome of the Witch Alliance, so that she has been holding the heart can finally relax a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, she also saw how amazing a banquet initiated and participated by the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black flame instantly bakes the steak, and the tub that holds it is unharmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little girl with short blond hair flies in the air and fills everyone's cup with a jug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like an alien witch who simulates a variety of musical instruments and eventually converges into a beautiful piece of music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the introduction of the nightingale, she quickly remembered everyone The name was unconsciously integrated into the group, and the sadness in the heart was diluted a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mature book in the Witch Alliance and Wendy, with leaves and echoes like her sister, and Anna, Soroya, etc., who are similar to her age. People, no matter who they are, have not treated her as a stranger. Lucia was grateful for this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the banquet, she and the witches exchanged good nights and returned to the new residence - the prince of the prince supplied himself and the bell to the last room on the second floor of the castle. Although the bell was not a witch, he did not order himself to be separated from his sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister?" Hearing the bell, the bell opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you awake!?" Lucia had a happy heart and walked to the bed in two steps in three steps. "How do you feel?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell looks like it’s a big sleep, and the pain caused by the disease does not leave any trace on the body. Her eyes were a little confused, but her mouth muttered: "I feel so hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait..." Lucia rushed out of her pocket The bag, opened and the smell of the grilled fish overflowed - this is the dried fish that the nightingale handed to her, "There is something to eat here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Sitting on the bed with a bell of fish fillets, she patted the little guy's head with relief. My sister is only ten years old this year. Now she has no parents. She can only rely on herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bells swallowed a lot after the two fish fillets, and she looked around. "Where are we? There is no such big bed on the boat." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bentham Town in the West, we arrived at the destination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Has it already? "She touched her cheek. "But I am not... sick? Will they agree to let the sick people enter the town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, indeed No, Lucia was teased by her sister's look. "But the witch under the Lord's Master has cured you," she said in detail about what happened at the dock. "We are staying in his castle now." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
