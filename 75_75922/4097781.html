			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the iron axe walked into a messy Jinsuicheng, there was no expression on the surface, and the heart was surprised at the destruction effect of the new firearms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this kind of weapon, which was called a mortar, was involved in the test phase many times, it is not the same thing to put in actual combat and test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group consisting of five people, each carrying two shells, can also play such a situation without the support of backup ammunition, it is really shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the firing rate of the mortar is much higher than that of the front field gun, and he also envisioned dozens of groups of volley scenes, but when they first witnessed it, He found himself still underestimating the firearm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortar can’t be as powerful as the fortress, but it’s light and easy to use, it can be used with the help of a witch, and it can also cross the wall to attack the body. Subsequent targets, in the case of sufficient ammunition, the blow to the enemy is almost devastating. If he was replaced by the first army to withstand such firepower, he did not know that the troops could persist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No...I can’t hold it up, it’s normal, in the face of overwhelming fire, it’s not good to scare the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Axe now understands why he was confidently throwing all the seemingly fine field guns back into the kiln area - in front of the mortar The solid core projectile weapon used before has indeed no need for equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, the entire Grey Fort is estimated that only Roland can afford such a firearm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the light, the cost of a shell is about three or four gold dragons, which means that just over 300 pieces have been hit out in an instant, spending money like running water. It’s just that. The flowering bomb used in the fortress can be several times more expensive. If the devil is in the future, can the Golden Dragon stored in the warehouse be able to support the end of the war of the gods without the support of the winter city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, it is not him who is worried about this problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Barov go to a headache. After all, the army has only one mission, and that is to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the long street filled with smoke, the iron axe came to the center of the city square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been surrounded by the first army, all the aristocrats who survived were brought here, waiting for the disposal after surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swept over the gray-faced people, but he had not yet opened, and a nobleman had stood up. "I am the lord of the Bay, Count of Kasin, may I ask Roland Where is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many water systems around Jinsuicheng. The territory is named after the bay and the beach. The iron axe is vaguely remembered. The ship bay is a piece of gold spike and sea breeze. The large seal between the counties, the family that can occupy this kind of territory, should enjoy the eyes of the people who admire and fear on weekdays. However, at this time, the politeness of the other party's deliberate chin and pretending to be reserved is a bit ridiculous. "There is no time to take care of the East, and I am solely responsible for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You-?" Earl of Cassin suddenly frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy is making a joke, isn't he a Gray Fortress at first glance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Roland Wimbledon will let a Saudi citizen manage the army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can the big event such as the expedition not be intimate? Is he not afraid of the army? Are you smashing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than just the lord of the Bay, there was a burst of suspicion in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The commander of the Eastern Front is indeed an axe, and we can all testify," said the adjutant Xiongzhang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"East Line Army? What is that?" Cassin asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nature refers to the army that recovers the East--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bear Palm!" The axe slammed the words of the adjutant, and the latter realized his own words at the moment, and quickly grabbed his mouth with his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
