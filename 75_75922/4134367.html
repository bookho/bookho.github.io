			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah-!" The exclamation of the leaves that came suddenly behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash went back and found that the wind that passed over her body did not disappear. Although it weakened a lot, the leaves were still blown away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the demon is also behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...how is it possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cyclone is a power, why is the stone of God's punishment not completely sealed off its effect? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the ash slammed the sword back and went straight to the other's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the enemy blocked the shot with just one hand. Under the cross, she clearly saw the blue wave of light shining on the devil's arm. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon did not even look at her more, but rolled up the wind again, blowing the leaves farther. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy...the goal is only one leaf! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes pressed behind the enemy, but they were gradually pulled away, and the leaves tried to counterattack, but the devil was only waving. All her efforts were futile. This level of disparity cannot be compensated by the will, and the flow of magic in the entire space is disturbed. It is very difficult to gather power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the high-level devil's control over the magic? Whether it is the ability to interrupt the leaves, or to take the time to repel yourself, it seems to be done with ease. The gray sweats secrete sweat, and then we will not be able to catch up with the deadly ones that may come at any time. Hit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this critical moment, the spirit of the ashes has been concentrated as never before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurry up, faster! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past two years, she has been following Takira’s extraordinary training method, most of the time wearing heavy weights, and really can feel the body after taking off The changes - the magic that attaches to the muscles and bones is getting bigger and bigger, constantly moisturizing every corner of the body, she even has the illusion that they are replacing the flesh and blood a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She must be faster to save the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and...protect the person she wants to protect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the drive of consciousness, the magic began to condense toward the legs - in the sacred duel with Luo Jia, the ashes saw a strange fighting skill, the magic Focusing on a certain part of the body can greatly increase its explosiveness and tolerance, which is why the wolf woman can control the individual changes of the limb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Demon did not focus on her, allowing her to focus on the flow of magic in her body, and the fragmented background around her made this feeling More clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the devil’s fourth skill was re-applied and the distance between the two was pulled 20 meters away, it directly broke the vine defense of the leaves. The sharp claws pricked to her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hit seems to be hard to recover again~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, gray The strength of the whole body is against the big tree! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, she felt that she had caught something faintly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body seems to be turned into a lightning, more than 20 meters away from the blink of an eye, as if time is stagnant. Even without the eyes, she can clearly "see" the broken tree and the broken bones, and the blast brought by the sprint breaks the branches and overwhelms the weeds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy stopped for the first time and raised her hands to block her sniper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pong-砰!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes went on and on, holding the fallen leaves and holding her behind them again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" The devil picked up his eyebrows and revealed a hint of interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, the ashes waiting for the reinforcements finally arrived at the battle site - — The demon witch team stationed at the forest terminal jumped out of the jungle and pulled the shotgun trigger to the only enemy. The huge roar sounded through the woods, and the bullets spurted toward the target like raindrops, while the latter used the trunk as a cover to dodge like a ghost. Even so, in the scattered bark and debris, it also I can see a burst of blue light from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A farther away is the rushing and messy footsteps. Obviously, after the gods are punished, the First Army is also completing the encirclement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil finally looked at the ashes and jumped up, his body violently bursting out with amazing magic, then quickly rushed straight up, disappeared after counting In the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn," the leading goddess of punishment took a sip and walked to the ashes and squatted down. "My name is Elena, are you okay?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem is not big," Ashes looked at the half-conscious leaf in his eyes and reached out and gently wiped the blood from her mouth. "But she needs treatment." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure," Elena said comfortably. "I received a frontline notice, Miss Nana and Miss Nikko are already on the way." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ascendant just landed, and there was a first-time bodyguard who greeted Come here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Esruque, this is a breathing can for you--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After it had not finished, he was taken away by the other party and took a deep breath at the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“嘶——————”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Ursuk is like Slow down, "Replace it for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discharge waste After the can, the guards inserted a new can with a long arm into its back ridge. For the ascending person, this kind of exchange in the body does not depend on hyperthyroidism, and it does not hinder the action. It is a more ideal means of carrying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if you are here..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a little worse, but it’s in itself "Unexpectedly," Ersk said with a blank expression. "After all, there is a human territory. If this is not blocked, I should doubt whether Cabradabi really betrayed us." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, they are not really you." The guards screamed, "The breathing cans limit your strength, if it is in the scope of the birth tower. Inside, those bugs are not your opponent at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drive magic will speed up the consumption of life, especially for high-level promoters, considering round trips The amount of sputum required, it is equivalent to wearing a squat in battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So this time it’s just a bait. I will pick a fairer place next time," Erskuk looked to the south of the forest, "... A graveyard suitable for long sleep."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the Lord of Heavenly Supreme Lord can support you more," the guards are a little bit sloppy, "you don't have to use this." The way of adventure, the tower of the birth of Takira also..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adventure?" Erskuk interrupted his subordinates, "I fell It’s very interesting. After all, listening to people’s reports is far from experiencing it personally.” It buckled the deformed steel ball from the armor and took a moment to look at it. “The same females who are awakened have no growth. However, the males who have no magic have changed, and those human beings are not completely useless... It would be better if they could learn more about them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
