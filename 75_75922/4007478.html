			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it just like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing these words, Ai Gesha was relieved a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the devil lies in a large number, if only for a small number of madness, one or two high-level witches can pack them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a way to imprison them now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new witch is just right Do this," Roland told them about their abilities. "After Iphi captured the devil, the cage can be easily taken away with the balloon. Of course, I will also prepare things like handcuffs and ankles to protect them. Not much. What I want to ask is, how long can the red mist carried by the devil persist? Can the blood after death be used to make a seal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So... Ai Gesha has fully understood his purpose. "In general, a can of red fog can last for a day or so. The devil will choose to carry the number of fog tanks depending on the task, such as performing surveillance and patrol missions. Their mounts will carry three to four cans - but this is the limit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Roland was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After leaving the strange Blackrock Spire, the fog will gradually fail," she explained. "If not, the Quest will be able to raise the devil and the Chaos." A large number of synthetic imprints. The Federation’s three seats have not been tried in this way. For example, some outposts who took the initiative to attack the devil, want to snatch a small black stone tower, but the enemy will always destroy it before it is defeated, leaving it to The sacred warrior is just a withered stone tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Withered?" The other side is different. "Can the stone wither?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one knows what it is, but the stone that comes back is not too much to describe with wilting. It should be a smooth surface that becomes rough and dull. And with the help of one hand, it can drop a lot of stone chips, which is completely different from what the samurai first saw."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand..." Roland For a moment, "If you can bring the devil back, can you make a magic stone print?"<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me enough experimental materials, independent labs, and twenty mortals as assistants," Aegusa said with a finger. "The simple success rate is about 80%. Advanced... Well, you don’t have any related magic stones anyway.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These are all right," he hesitated, whispering. "But What if the trapping operation attracted a group of demons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha couldn’t help but laugh out, "Look at your confident self-confidence, I thought you never worried about this problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, I just want to make sure nothing is wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said easily, "Take me and Miss Anna."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You and...Anna?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may not have a correct understanding of the witches in your territory, Your Majesty," Aegusa sighed. "Know that the forces are spread throughout the fertile soil." The original federation, there are only a hundred high-level witches, of which less than forty are combat-type, they form the backbone of the federation and the backbone of the holy army. And in your witch alliance, there are several High-level witches, plus those weird weapons, are as powerful as a St. Baptist, and it is not difficult to eat a group of devils. Even if she meets the hell lord, Miss Anna can activate two divine signatures. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... I almost forgot that thing," Roland realized, "Thank you for your proposal." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're welcome, defeating the devil is my life's wish, don't let me down, kneel. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aegis was preparing to leave, and the other party stopped her.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I still have a puzzle. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did you have such a big reaction to the offensive devil camp?" Roland raised his eyebrow. "You didn't say that before. I remember that you didn't just ask for an initiative to attack them, even if you sacrificed." The chaotic beast that may exist in the camp, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Ge Shah suddenly felt his cheeks get hot, and I don’t have to look at it to know that it’s definitely a red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t say that Roland was unable to stop the devil at all, and was bragging about his own force, and said the remarks for the purpose of anger. Now that the situation in the territory is good, as long as time is given, the human strength will become stronger and stronger, and the attitude will naturally become completely different. "Is there? I don't remember saying this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you did..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, squat, I feel very sleepy," she yawned forcibly. "Please let me go first." He left the office without saying back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing through the corridor leading to the Witch House, the cool evening breeze blew on the face of Ai Gesha, and her mood gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the stars, her face suddenly appeared in Wendy’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He will one day become the king of the Grey Fort, leading us to defeat any enemy, I believe so."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, she saw her convinced expression. Ai Gesha felt both envious and sad. The envy was that they had not been overwhelmed by the cruel reality. The sad thing is that trust cannot reverse the strength. difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, she also has a little bit of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Iphie can't remember how she returned to the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scene of guns roaring in her mind - hundreds of people lined up neatly, triggering the trigger on the front target, except for the thick white Outside the smoke, she couldn't see anything, even if the magic could perceive it, it was too late to trap the bullets with a cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no lie, the power of metal ammunition far exceeds the special bullets that McMug has used in his duel, and the wooden targets outside the hundred steps are hit thousands. The sore is a hundred holes, and the witch can only be beaten passively at this distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for another kind of weapon called a gun, it is even more terrible. The attack range is several times that of a gun. Even the observation mirror is needed to observe the shooting result. The guards who can lead the team said that this is just the oldest field gun. A weapon called the 152mm fortress gun is the real trump card of the artillery battalion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of explosions sounded in her mind, and eventually all became a thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hetty Morgan has deceived us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ifei muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It may also be that she did not expect to have such power in the world," Yu Yu looked complicated, apparently also shocked by the military training in the afternoon. "What should we do afterwards?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't answer, no matter what kind of purpose Herti had previously, it didn't make sense at the moment, because she knew, kneel down The bloody teeth you want will not be able to afford it at all - the many auxiliary witches under Tilly Wimbledon are obviously much more useful than the witches who fight in the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the experience of the past few years, she found that her proud ability and growth have become a joke, except for Anne, there is nothing else. Worth remembering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, she looked up. "I don't want to go back to the blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "..." Yu Yu nodded and nodded, "Me too." Then she groaned, "Are you crying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iphie Feeling a bit salty on the corner of her mouth, she raised her hand and wiped her cheeks. The feeling of wetness came from the fingertips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
