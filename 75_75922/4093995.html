			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are Roland, right?" Just as Roland looked at the "erosion" meditation, he suddenly began to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah... it’s me," he said, coming back from the dignified thoughts, and suddenly flashed through the words of Garcia in his mind... and so on, The other party will not be looking for trouble in putting pigeons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard Garcia mention you several times," she didn't look at Roland, the latter couldn't see her expression, "She It is rare for ordinary people to say that you are rare and independent awakened person who is not interfered with by desire. You are very happy to join the association."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Hey... is it?" Roland replied with a hard scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The independence of the other party should be a wild meaning, but he remembers the night he promised to join, Garcia almost asked him to fill out the application, which I am very happy to come here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I hate people who are not punctual, this is a common problem for most people. After all, you can't feel the change of time, you can't hear it." Ticking - so for some special people, it is not an unbearable shortcoming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inexplicably, Roland feels that the chief disciple said these words Suddenly with a hint of emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is one thing you need to know. Although there are not many special people, they are not too small under the huge base. If you don't cherish your specialities. And bring it to the limit, so sooner or later it will be eliminated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is admonishing yourself to be wholeheartedly working for the association, not like other wild awakened people Is it awkward? Roland frowned in his heart, and he really didn't like this kind of preaching warning. I might not mind before, but after he became the king of the Grey Fort, his mood has become different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you're finished watching it, go on," he said at this moment, and said slowly, "Let me listen to what I said later, it might It is helpful to you. The next one -!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pouted, did not put this brief conversation in mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge puzzle is now covering him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether the martial arts association can defeat erosion and save the world, he does not care about this kind of thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to his seat and he was still frowning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the "God" thinking about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the research data of underground civilization, the Red Moon is the key to transforming the magic and the basis of the existence of the dream - in a sense it is equivalent to hiding behind the scenes The ambassador, the background board generally exists, even if you want to annex the dream world, there is absolutely no need to show its original appearance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women can see the true body of the Red Moon because it is the real world, but this is a field based on the memory of him and Jieluo’s memory. Isn't this the same as the person who intubated behind the brain saw the circuit signal running behind the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, the previous speculations were all wrong, and there was any deviation in the understanding of the information, which led me to guess the wrong direction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, now you believe it?" Garcia gave him a look. "That is definitely not something that can exist in reality."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't doubt you," Roland shook his head and temporarily suppressed the distracting thoughts in his heart. "It's your master, not as terrible as you said." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened to the master?" She gave a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me a lot of words, what special people, what association is very optimistic," Roland said casually, "Yes... she I also said that you are very happy that I agree to join the association. Is there really? I can't see it at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of his intention here Looking to the former three-timed woman, I want to see what kind of expression she will reveal. Is it a denial, or is it a hurried disguise? Whatever it is, it should be very interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?" Garcia rolled her eyes. "When you are on the platform, the master has not spoken. Are you a blind man?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Roland can't help but see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This distance may be quite far from ordinary people, but I am a martial artist. You have a few beards on the stage. I can see clearly. Want to lie to me? You are too tender." She disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No...speak? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he still wanted to ask two sentences, he had re-closed the glass box, clapped his hands and focused everyone’s attention on the podium. - This time, the discussion in the hall was much smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our world is not straight, but on a film, some people can understand, and some people do not understand, but no Relationship, just listen to me." She turned and let the screen behind her show what she said. "This film has a curvature. In general, it shows a curved shape - in some places, this The changes will become more apparent. If there are other worlds outside the world, there will be a possibility that the two worlds meet at one point, and such convergence is erosion."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is only a speculation, but only this speculation can explain the vision we have seen - since the erosion was discovered, the research on it has not been suspended, but regrettable Yes, the world there has completely different rules, and any means of detection are declared ineffective. Even the material on this side cannot be stabilized after crossing the border. You have also seen that the iron bar is proof."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This What does it matter who fall magic? "Someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the power they gain comes from another membrane - this is why the demon is not afraid of the martial arts. Overlapping membranes Making the two worlds temporarily connected, I don't know how this will affect the world over there, but for us, the rules still work: energy spreads from high to low, and creates a series of incredible Phenomenon. "岚 Increased the volume. "Exactly, not only the demon, any awakened person is related to this energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say..."?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My strength belongs to me only, nothing to do with the shit!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the martial arts association think that we are no different from the demon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall suddenly blasted the pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, there was no word to stop it, until everyone was consciously quiet, she continued. "Of course there is a difference, we can control it, and the demon can't." But we have to admit that we are very similar to the demon in a certain sense - especially in the fight against Fan Wu. I don't know if you have considered a problem, since the power of nature is trained to send and receive. After that, you can immunize any harm. Why did the martial arts master not dominate the whole world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." The scene whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because erosion does not always exist," he said straight away. "As the curvature changes, the overlapping membranes will gradually separate until the next reunion - this The cycle can be long or short, short to eve, and long can be hundreds of millions of years. The erosion we encountered is about two thousand years, and the overlap time is less than one hundred years. Once broken, the force of nature It will disappear without a trace, so although the awakened becomes the hegemon of the world, and the world is dominated, the interval of more than two thousand years is enough to make the imperialism he created."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The millennium century, even the ordinary history is unclear, how do you know what happened in the past?" Although there are still people who question, the attitude has converged a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," the chief disciple said calmly. "This is just a hypothesis. There were no scientific observations and recording methods two thousand years ago. I want to verify it." It’s only after two thousand years, but don’t forget that history is always full of amazing coincidences. As long as you compare the biographies and history books of different regions, you will find that many heroic epics and legends were born during that period. Going forward, it is the age of mythology - and most myths are related to the end of the world and salvation. Can we think that it is erosion that has created this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
