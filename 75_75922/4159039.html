			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the plain hinterland, the daily time on the floating island of Eleanor gradually became similar. Most people only knew that they were moving, but I don’t know. Where to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the top officials in the command post know that they are narrowing the distance to the target a little bit - the track curve marked on the map clearly shows this At one point, every 12 hours, the floating island will adjust its direction to the east; according to the information returned by the expedition, for up to 18 days, their route will meet with the path of the god of the new god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the calm did not last until that day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the official departure, the unchanging days were broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that discovered the enemy was an old-fashioned Skyfire - it was part of the Airborne Scouting Unit and was one of the few models that retained the two-seat. The rear seat no longer has a machine gun position, but is replaced with a spark telegraph machine and a radio station. It is a special modification for full-time investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One hundred and fifty kilometers away, there is a beast that is approaching us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp According to the charter, the crew first used the telegraph to take the information, and then repeated it with the walkie-talkie. The former was to inform the floating island, while the latter was to warn the companions in the nearby airspace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the excellent electromagnetic environment, the transceiver quickly received the message and translated it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he took the message with a note, the atmosphere in the staff room was one, and then it boiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly determine the identity and location of the crew!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raise the warning, let the engineering class Withdraw!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, here is the staff, please prepare for the battle immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The ground handling report, the No. 5 and No. 11 elevators have failed and are undergoing emergency repairs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time? Let them hurry!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland, who was notified, also arrived at the command post for the first time. "What is the current situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The enemy is still more than two hours away from us." Itis reported with a stack of documents, "The direction is northeast, the number is more than 30, the reconnaissance plane has got rid of the other side's pursuit, but they do not seem to change. Original route."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean that the devil found the existence of the floating island?" asked the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It shouldn't be there, otherwise they won't just send such a person. But the devil must have noticed what it is, and the route will be so clear." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not surprising." Roland calmly answered, even if the floating island is small, it is also a floating hill. It is almost impossible to completely hide this kind of goal. Just like lightning, they found the god of God. As long as the distance between the two keeps close, the enemy will notice the uninvited guest sooner or later. "Silvi's magic eye is more about the sky. If the ground has a devil squad that happens to meet us, it is normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northland Pearl nodded "Their main purpose is to verify intelligence, and this number of fearful beasts, the empty knight should be able to do it all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s not going to affect the results.” Roland has realized this – it’s impossible to avoid the fear of the beast at the speed of the island of Eleanor, in a sense, The exposure of the floating island is a foregone conclusion. “The key is how to minimize the cost.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the Air Knight has been steadily growing, from the desperate mountain blockade, the generation of Skyfire and II The total number of generations of wrath has exceeded 200, which is almost the number of two wings. But the problem is that the enemy is out of the nest, no matter whether the force or the logistics are no longer bound, even if the exchange is better than the good, the aircraft will inevitably suffer losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean by using the "B plan"? Tilly raised her eyebrows.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, by the way, you can test the results of the witch." Roland no longer hesitates. "Let your people enter the basement." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two hours later, the enemy found a trace of the floating island. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Itis said, they are indeed for investigation, but a little unexpected is that the beast is four or fifty kilometers away. I stopped moving forward. The first person looked at the instrument with a lookout mirror for a moment, then went straight back and returned, and there was no idea to come and test it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It seems that the devil has learned a lot from the mask. "Northern Pearls raised their lips. "Now they finally know how to fear their opponents. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy will never surrender. "The iron axe stared at the sky." In the next few days, it should not be as calm as before. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Istis’s voice is as cold as the north, "and this is a good opportunity to weaken their power!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon, the devil's first wave of attacks appeared on the skyline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look like they don’t even want to wait for a day.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, more than an hour ago, The army was ready to take over. All the gates of the external passages were closed, and the non-reconnaissance detachments of the two wings were also lowered to the underground hangar. The entire surface of the floating island was empty, and even the top of the northern slope was transformed. The bridge, its portholes have been sealed. At this moment, the island of Eleanor is almost as airtight as a huge stone mountain.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top is directly gathered In the command post, observe the outside world through the projection of the curtain created by the magic core.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wave of fearful beasts has more than two hundred, when they are row When the line was rushing toward the floating island, even the sky seemed to be dim.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s quite a lot..." Tilly Wrinkle Start up <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Roland nodded, "It's estimated that just Onslaught only. "How to say, the troops behind the Devil's King City are all the power of the Blackrock Field. Since the madness is expected to be as many as 10 million, then the fearful beast will not be too small.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid this is the last serenity in their trip.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The quantity is enough, but what can they do with a mountain?" Suddenly a voice was inserted into everyone's mind, and the tone of the twist was slightly lazy, so people would not forget it if they heard it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker is Eleanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most impeccable point of the tactics - indeed, there is not much way for humans to take a God-made god, but the devil is the same in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next step is for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, this is a time lapse Revenge for more than four hundred years." Eleanor replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her vision, an invisible net is slowly spreading, and the beasts that move above this net are all turned into a string. String number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathematics is really interesting...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She injects magic into the tentacles, and then To the entire floating island, nearly 100 micro-cores that have been activated have bloomed blue, and the mechanical devices connected to them have also worked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine gun towers distributed on the edge of the island turned to the direction of the enemy one by one, and the barrel protruded from the shooting hole to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
