			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Record"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12, the first day of the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hazard test was conducted in accordance with Roland’s request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty cocks were placed evenly around the bench, one of which was located at a direct red spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exposure time is five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target cock reacted very violently, hitting the left and right in the cage, while the other cocks did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slight burnt smell on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the irradiation, a slight burning trace was found on the feathers of the target cock. But such a faint injury is not enough to cause the feathers to break away. It should be that the target is falling when struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the feathers seems to be somewhat listless, but the overall is basically normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, its harm is not as good as a torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recorder: Celine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13, the second day of the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target cock begins to diarrhea, whining, as if suffering from a plague. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other cocks are all normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of Roland seems to be a bit dignified (this sentence is deleted from the official record). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No new tests have been conducted today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14, the third day of the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target cock is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dissection, it was found that there was water in the target body, blood was immersed in the internal organs, and there was corruption under the skin - this is usually one day after the animal died. There will be symptoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the red light killed the chicken skin in advance while keeping the target alive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminiscent of the story of the Cursed Temple and the Thorns, and the scenes in those murals, it seems quite like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cursed person was tortured in the seemingly innocent situation, and eventually until the body collapsed, although the person was alive, he watched the body die a little bit. I feel that it is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I retracted the preface, although its lethality is still not as good as a torch, but the way is much different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland has his own opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that the red light destroys the function of the living body to renew itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the microscopic level that is invisible to the naked eye, the body grows and dies all the time, forming a balance between the two. Therefore, once the growth is stopped, a large area of ​​necrosis will occur. The so-called curse is essentially the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with no more evidence to deny this statement (the following paragraph is removed from the official record). <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microscope is a fascinating invention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the data collected from the dream world can also be mutually reinforcing with the observations, indicating that the organisms are constructed from growing small cell bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that I am in contact with a new field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately I can’t enter the dream world myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that I want to know the relevant knowledge, at least to reach the "high school" level, and the general study time is nine years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, would it be too reluctant for Felice and Elena to speed up the process? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16, the fifth day of the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All cocks are buried in the depths of the earth, regardless of their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laboratory performed a thorough cleaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, the test continues. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target was replaced with three cows to test the possibility of the ritual as a weapon and the target's tolerance to red light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20th, the ninth day of the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three target exposure times reached ten minutes, fifteen minutes, and half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even the longest-lived cows survived for four days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the devil’s ability to resist, it’s impossible to stand in the same place waiting for a long exposure—even if the “curse” will continue to cause damage, at least On the battlefield, the outcome is only a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene in the temple murals defeating the object giant statue with the ritual magic cube, it is just an exaggeration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And or...they are particularly vulnerable to this "cursed light" resistance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21st, the tenth day of the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the confirmation that the Rubik's Cube will not spread the hazard to the surrounding area, Roland agreed to the outdoor test plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test site is still selected at the bottom of the desolate mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion is quite disappointing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red light range cannot exceed 100 meters, and any obstacle can further weaken its penetration distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some metal materials can even block it completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, ten golden dragons stacked together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even pure water also has a good blocking effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conclusion almost vetoed its use in weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26, the fifteenth day of the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cure test when Nana Wa returned from the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is actually between cure and incurable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if the irradiated cow only repairs the damaged parts of the skin and organs, the condition will still deteriorate and the healing part will re-infect the "curse". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we chose a complete small organ to be removed after treatment and transplanted to another healthy cow and found that it did not continue to deteriorate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that has exceeded the magic limit of Nana Va. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to prove it, you need to use Speer Passy's channel ability, so you can only put it on hold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of insurance, it is better to define it temporarily as "incurable". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the way, the number one cow finally died and survived for ten days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28, the seventeenth day of the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ritual cube re-issued the blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coin was consumed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there is a coin of the same coin under Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, after all, the raw material for making the "sun shine", not only in a scarce amount, but also extremely difficult to collect, I feel that I am wasting the world's most precious resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical power of the Rubik's Cube has also bottomed out, but like the signature, it can be added at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about its consumption, such testing should not continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the scheduled resistance project is tested, I hope to be able to disassemble it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took a breath and closed the "experimental version of the test record." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are watching it again." The nightingale leaned on the lounge chair and chewed the fish in the mouth. "The result is not very obvious, the legendary antiquity The treasure is nothing more than a torture instrument. It has no incredible effect except to torture the captives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, just like the engraving in the mural, it was made The only purpose of coming out is to torture the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle is probably about the same as ionizing radiation, and the uranium currency is the raw material - the reason for the excitation is unknown, but the results are basically similar. The difference is that the ritual cube can regulate the direction in which the high-energy particles advance, which is equivalent to directional illumination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suspects that the red light is only used to indicate the target of the illumination, similar to a laser sight, not the same as the ray itself - after all, it can be seen with the naked eye If it is a neutron beam or a high-energy electron, it is too ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the truth of the cursed temple and the mystery of the violent death of the residents of the town of thorns are all answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A civilization that worships radioactive elements, using magic to create such a conversion device, has a very simple function, and can inject a small amount of high energy after filling in high-purity radioactive materials. Particle beam. As for why it will be invalid after 100 meters, I am afraid it is also related to magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this conclusion slightly makes him somewhat empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has already touched the higher physical level. He thought that this thing would be a little bigger, but I’m afraid it’s in the hands of the original owner, it’s like a whip or a guillotine. There is no difference in the torture instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also considered to be the difference between civilized groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty," Just then, outside the door, the report of the guardian Sean was heard. "The Taqila witch sent the latest test record. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan, this test is the last one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Average different animals for the same length of time to determine the specific ratio of body shape to tolerance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After then, stop all experiments on the Rubik's Cube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, uranium is hard to come by, and more important uses are waiting for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
