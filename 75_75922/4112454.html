			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clean up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena looked out from the deck Yi, asked the opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it took some time to find someone," she wiped the blood on her face. "It’s okay."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you do later?" Betty shrugged. "Write a report to Roland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let Elena go to write, I am not good at summing up. Anyway, I have not taken this seriously, only to say that the overall situation is stable, and the means of disposal are arbitrary. Write him as a person who is unwilling to fail and be guilty." For such a person, it is still relatively clean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what it is," Betty said with a confident look. "If it is not a bad heart, why?" Would you like to choose a border city that is closest to the morning sun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although your attitude is arbitrary, we can't do it." Elena cleared her throat. "This The report will list the causes and consequences and the basis of the analysis, including your speeches – just like the minutes in the City Hall.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just want to get his appreciation to get the chance to go to the dream world a few times," Zoe rolled his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you, nonsense!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, can you still do this? I am I didn't think..." Betty's eyes glanced at Elena. "How do you teach me how to write a formal report?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...Let's talk again "The latter coughed twice. "Now let's solve the problem first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Zoe also put away the look of teasing, "but this Don't write it in the report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know." Elena turned and looked at the other side of the deck, beckoning to several black robe men. "Come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man headed by the two men rushed to the front of the three people and walked to the trio. "God makes the adults, may I ask?" What is the order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are willing to come here with us, you have already prepared enough?" Elena asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is the founder of "black money", the legendary businessman of the Glow City, Barry Losa. Although the goddess of witches is unmatched in battle, some things still require the help of mortals, such as intercepting Ampein at sea and ensuring that the death of the other party is completely disconnected from the gray fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a mortal, Jun is an unimaginable crime, especially the end of a royal blood. Even more wealth can't offset this ridiculous bloodline worship, which can be seen from Barrych's trembling shoulders. However, he still walked out of this step, and this move is enough to prove his ambition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...I am willing to serve the adults for God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's relax, Elena patted him on the shoulder with satisfaction. "In the eyes of the gods, the identity of the mortal is meaningless. What about the king? But it is a title with a vacant name. Let's talk about it, what are you going to do next?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry has eased a little. "In the three scenarios, I still prefer the first one, pretending to be the most secure shipwreck. This route will be every year." There are dozens of ships that have sunk due to storms, tsunamis, and reefs. Especially after two days in the border area, there will be a heavy rain. Just take the boat to the depths of the sea and drive through the bottom of the ship. No one will know. Everything happened here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gasped and went on, "As for disguising as a pirate robbing or aristocratic revenge, it is impossible to be impeccable, although it Can transfer people's doubts to specific goals, can be fake is fake, as long as you can always find some spiders If you can't find it, those nobles can make some flaws themselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is a shipwreck, are you sure that all the clues will disappear?" Zoe asked coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
