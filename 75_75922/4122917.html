			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a mountain capital that faces the mountains and faces the plains, there are two lovely and lively little princesses. The two are extremely good and inseparable. No matter where you go, you can attract people's attention and cheers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, it didn't last long. At the age of fourteen, my sister became a witch." - This is not a big deal. The reason why people can settle down in this precipitous place is inseparable from the help of the witch. The problem is that the ability of the sister to get so strange, can not help but make her more radiant, Instead, it destroyed her original good face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She's her auricle gradually shrinks, her hairy ears grow on her head, her fingers grow longer and she is It is difficult to shave the hair, even the face is faint and not like human."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one has ever seen such a witch, even the court tutor I dare not confirm that this is caused by awakening."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know Who opened the head first, but as the status of the princess did not get better, the palace suddenly appeared the "curse"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I need to play Is it my sister? Luo Jia couldn't help but touch his face, but fortunately... the cheeks did not grow short hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the description of the chieftain is too horrible, she has become the appearance because of repeated use of ability, if it is awakened, it will be dehumanized. It is strange that the trend is not rejected and hated by others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this should be changed again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women turned over and changed into a more comfortable position, and turned the next page with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although my sister doesn't mind the changes of her sister at all, but my sister also feels the growth of strength in the body - this power is so powerful, almost impossible to control In order not to hurt her sister, she deliberately alienated the other party and locked herself in the depths of the palace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no difference between the two people The crack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And this compartment is four years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Until the younger sister In the winter of the age of sixteen, the accident suddenly came."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A different king came to the capital of the mountains and said that he would marry the little princess. His team Out of the city, he was discharged five miles away; his men honored him as the Lord of the World; his gold and silver jewels were more dazzling than the sun; his appearance made the girls in the city look intent."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The King of Joy, held a grand banquet in the palace to entertain the distant guest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Some nobles praised him and thought that if the little princess could marry such a person, it would bring the supreme wealth and prosperity to the mountain capital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;""I disagree! ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At this moment, the long princess who has not appeared for a long time suddenly appeared in the banquet hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"She couldn't sit down and see her sister and was taken away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, the four-year barrier has caused my sister to hesitate."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Under sadness and disappointment, her strength finally got out of control, not only swept the hall, but also injured the different kings and escaped the mountain. All."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah... this idiot, Luo Jia could not help but hold his forehead, the ability will not be more and more familiar, the long princess must be lack of practice, will So strange to power. If it is her, it will inevitably let the father and the king make a show of martial arts, and spend every day in the inside and people, so that they can really grow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second year after her awakening, she can hold the cup in the wolf-shaped arm without crushing it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, Luo Jia only intended to read through it, but when she saw it, she found that she was not only immersed in, but could not wait to know what was going on. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
