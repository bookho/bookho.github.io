			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...this feeling is too...worse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the narrow The esophagus climbed out of the belly of the worm carrier, and Ai Gesha licked her mouth and vomited. "I feel like being placed in a bag full of mucus, and then smashing it into the wall for dozens of times." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Precisely described," the nightingale was so detached from the fog, and the people who looked at the wet answer shrugged. "If it wasn’t for Fran’s collapse, we are now It has to suffer." Because of the free ability in the foggy form, she does not need to get into the worm's stomach like everyone else, naturally without the impact of impact, stench and spoiled mucus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry...Is it too hard?" Fran asked cautiously, and the strong smell made Aegusa retching again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think...not bad," Lightning wiped the liquid from the hair and smelled it under the nose. "Being a giant reptile." Swallowing it into the belly and climbing it out intact, this is an unprecedented experience - no one has ever tried a similar attempt in the adventure home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Don't be content," Elena rolled her eyes. "It's more enviable than the unconscious, stinking and slimy feelings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; These words caused the unanimous approval of the godly witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well... don't say anything," Ai Gesha coughed twice, and the voice snorted and snorted. "The next question is, we should What should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the changes that occurred a quarter of an hour ago, the witches still have some feelings. Although Fran issued a warning at the first time, the matter of controlling his eyes was always faster than consciousness, especially when the weird humming sounded, more than one person could not help but raise his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one has seen the true body of the monsters - the only thing they can see is the millions of scarlet eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminiscent of the black stone tower swallowed by the worm, those dense eyes should belong to the alert eye of the tower. What is different from the eye magic is that it covers a much wider area, as if the body with a strange eye was flattened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the humming sounds, a large number of mixed species of evil beasts emerged in the depths of the ruins, and swarmed toward them. According to the nightingale, the magical light of countless magical lights suddenly appeared in the cave. They seemed to emerge from the sky, from the mountain wall, in the flowing water, in the darkness of the dome, in the monster body... almost everywhere. The raging spirits converge into a stream, and the noisy and squeaky squeaking of the rumbling waters, the whole snowy mountain is like awakening from sleep, attacking the uninvited intruder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this critical juncture, Fran made a crucial decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swallowed everyone except the nightingale and turned to drill in the hole, when the whole body did not enter the rock, the evil beast Also rushed over and madly biting her tail. Even if there is a nightingale to cover, it will drive away so many enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fulan endured severe pain and continued to drill for more than ten meters before he slammed his huge body and pressed the trailing evil beast into meat. cake. Then she arched her tail and slammed it on the top of the cave, causing the top rock to collapse and seal the hole before she got rid of the enemy's pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the witches hiding in her belly, they experienced a very memorable quarter of an hour. The shock caused by the inversion and slamming of the stone wall is enough for them to vomit. It’s going to be overwhelming. Not to mention that the storage cavity of the worm carrier is not far from the digestive cavity, and the taste of the corrupted food is almost suffocating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, everyone is ultimately safe and sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First we have to figure out what happened," Elena looked at Fran. "How are you trapped here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably because of the erosion of the water, the moment I pierced the passage, the rock underneath suddenly collapsed, and it was too late to react. I have fallen into the air and then not Knowing what hit on it, I lost consciousness directly.” Fulan replied weakly. “When I woke up, I found myself being carried by more than a dozen invisible bugs, and then I threw it into this place.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s really a blessing to not eat on the spot,” Fulan muttered. “Unfortunately, when I was planning to sneak away, I accidentally glanced at the top of the cave.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is it really a warning eye?" Ai Gesha asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know - although it saw me when I saw it, the monster was much bigger than the magic eye." The worm sighed and a hurricane suddenly rushed to everyone. "Oh, sorry... Ellina, they can't smell, I don't usually pay attention to this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, it doesn't matter," the ice witch held her breath for a while. "Have you seen the whole picture?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was tied up After it had fallen for a while, it was soaked in the lake of the cave...” Fran paused for a moment and seemed to be thinking about the wording. “I don’t know how to describe it. The monster looks like a group. The visceral viscera, which is superimposed with a layer of eye-devil's body, is not integrated into one. It is like a forceful piece. I also saw many tentacles squirming between the two, and they don't know them. Is it a living bug or a part of the monster's body? But the organ below is bigger than the eye. - Even if it is a hell feared beast, it can't be compared with it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it taking the devil?" The nightingale frowned. "This is not a mere simple." "A mixture of evil beasts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it that can be put aside, we have to find a way to escape from here," Elena I took a shot of Fulan's mouth. "The next time I encounter this situation, remember to call out first, then say the content, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔... ..." the latter responded with dismay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you still move?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No effort..." Fran shook his head "I need to eat to continue to drive this carrier. The time stuck here allows me to consume all the food in my stomach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We put dry food Can you do it together?" Lightning asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not enough to estimate the distance she has drilled," Elena took a deep breath. "Now I can only wait for the reinforcements, or venture out." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just an adventure to wait in the same place," Aegusa said calmly. "The space here is too small, and we will suffocate in one day. In the hole. Even if Hilli can determine our position, the army must defeat those evil beasts to save us." She paused. "And don't forget, the enemy also has a worm-killing carrier."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But now rushing out, it is likely to be swallowed up by the herd," the gods prayed and hesitated. "And... what about Fran? She can't evacuate with us. If you stay here, you will not even have the chance to resist when you are discovered by the enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short... let me go outside to explore the situation," I didn't seem to want to participate in this dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can go, don't worry about me," Fran suddenly said. "The Takira witch never fears sacrifice, even if I become This look is always a part of Tacila. Right, there are some things in my stomach that may help you." After she squirmed her body, she spit out several muzzles from her mouth. The iron box is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The camping supplies that the First Army asked me to carry, “Fran gasped and said, “They said that these things are too heavy and inconvenient to carry, and I swallowed them by the way.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha turns the iron in turn Box - I saw that there were shovel, shovel, barbed wire and other soil work items inside. When I opened the last box, she could not help but hold it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This iron box is not big, but it is very solid. In addition to the stuffed wheat straw, it is neatly stacked more than ten The wooden box with the words "Chemical Second Factory, Sixty-fourth Batch of Products, Qualified" is marked on the box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If she remembers correctly, most of the nitrogen that has been decomposed is sent to the factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
