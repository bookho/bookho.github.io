			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Celine’s description of Eleanor’s “easy approach” is really wrong...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;In the case of Akaris, it is hard for Roland to imagine that the superb leader who is surrounded by the ice will say such things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... I believe you are." He waved his hands again and now, there is a large industrial area on the north slope mountain. It is definitely a disaster if you suddenly fly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, wait until I activate the core instrument and believe it again." Eleanor was a little sorry. Listening to her tone, it seems that it is a very regrettable thing to prove that my ability is on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland probably has some understanding of the three-sex temper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thinks she is not a qualified leader and does not mean that she is ordinary, she also has aspects that she is proud of - can become extraordinary No one is a sly person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right...when did you wake up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About a quarter of an hour Before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you are eavesdropping from the beginning! Roland groaned. "Then why don't you tell us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one has to make sure to get out of the world when you get up." Eleanor is confident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come after that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Otherwise, you still want me The younger generation’s face is ugly.” The two rows of eyes on her head flipped up together, and this large-scale white eye had a spectacular feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s even more embarrassing that you suddenly “wake up”! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Roland’s speechless, Eleanor changed the subject leisurely. “To be honest, I am still satisfied with you at the moment.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" He found that he couldn't keep up with the rhythm of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there is no trace of exploitation here," Eleanor replied. "This area is now connected with me, I can feel it, These god pillars are basically intact, and they prove that you have not played their ideas."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She means that she has not mined the god stone, so it is equal to not controlling the witch. intention? Roland circled around to understand the meaning of the other party's words. "Cylin should have told you about the Witch Alliance. Don't you believe her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not. It's just an illusion that people are easily created." Deception, especially for the king with unlimited power, disguise is not difficult." Eleanor said in an orderly manner, "Even if you do it for a while, it does not mean that you will do so in the future. It is a consideration for every leader." If you are wary, it is impossible not to be tempted by this Shenshi mining area. Secretly arrange mining and storage to prevent the witch forces from being able to control after the big forces become bigger, but the surface maintains a friendly face. This is not the case in the past. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sighed. "That's because too many people treat witches as aliens, but in my eyes, they are only in some ways. "Humans with unique advantages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it even if the witches occupy the upper echelons of the entire kingdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What you really want to ask is A "What is Lisi's claim?" Roland said straightforwardly. "As long as human beings can continue, the witch will be able to return to the peak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They even tell you this. ?? Eleanor was surprised for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That didn't, this is what I saw from the time stamp." Roland looked calm, "Akaris actually fell into the same misunderstanding. As long as the witch is replaced by a human being, isn’t this a matter of course? If the good person can’t lead the ethnic group, then this group is doomed to have no future. Similarly, if the superior is no longer seeking benefits for the whole family. , sooner or later, can't be maintained."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
