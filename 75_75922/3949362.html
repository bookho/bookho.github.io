Now, only the sound of the waves hitting the ship's side is in her ear. Although listening for a long time is a bit tedious, it is a lucky beat for the crew, which means that today is a good weather for sailing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, now there is another more, the ashes think. The footsteps pressed against the old teak board and made a slight squeaking sound - someone was coming to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to live in a sleepy island," a white-haired old man walked over to her and put his hands on the railing. "Where there It looks great, but once the tide rises, most of the land will be submerged by the sea and it is not suitable for settlement. Why not live in the Crescent Bay? It is the second largest island in the fjord and there are still many unoccupied open spaces. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack. One-eyed, the captain of the Beauty Beauty, as the name suggests, wears a blindfold on his face, completely covering his left eye. He is also one of the few captains who are willing to deliver supplies for witches. Although the flocks of the fjords are not as abhorrent to witches as the kingdom of the kingdom, they also do not like to care for outsiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not everyone is willing to deal with the witch like you," Gray said with a smile. "The island is indeed flooded by the sea, but it is because of this." The area is clearly ranked third among the fjord islands. It is still a desert island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The third area is not equal to the third living area. Captain Jack shrugged. "If you can't live, it doesn't make sense to be big. For example, the island of the fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the witch is best at is changing nature. "She said seriously, "not to mention that this island will be our home. As long as there is no suppression by the church, we can create a completely different world, a ... a new world." She paused for a moment, "You have How long have you not been to sleep in the island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain took off his hat and touched the back of his head. "It’s been almost a month, and I sent a group of witches last time. Full of pearls in the past. Really, the little girls are playing on the boat, taking my crew Look silly. You know how young the young man is drifting at sea, like a volcano that wants to erupt at any time. Fortunately, I stopped drinking them. Otherwise my beloved ship will suffer."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash automatically ignores his second half of the paragraph, "One month is enough to make a dramatic change, Mr. Captain. I bet, this time you see the sleeping island, will definitely It's very different from what you remember."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Jack whistled. "Then I look forward to... Wait, what is that?" He leaned out of the ship's side and looked sideways. "Monkey! On the mast, there seems to be something in front!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailor known as the monkey Climb your hands and feet to the top of the mast and raise the lookout. "Hey, that should be an island!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Island? What are you talking about?" The captain took a look at the north needle and looked at it. "How can there be other islands beside us sleeping in the vicinity?"<br /><b r />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is really an island, head, I dare to swear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You swear a top fart Use, let me come." Jack took off his hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, head, you still don't come up, here is a big wind," the monkey observed for a while, "the three gods are on!" Shouting incredulously, "I know, it's a sleepy island! It's getting higher!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Beauty Beauty slowly approaches the dock at Sleeping Island, a boatman can hardly believe his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering island is like a hill above the sea level. The wall is straight and steep, at least a few feet to the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash was the first time to arrive at the island, and the response was much calmer than most people, which became a symbol of calm and self-confidence in Captain Jack’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
