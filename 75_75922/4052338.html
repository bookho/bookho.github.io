			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly half a month of sailing, the sailboat finally entered the western boundary . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing the town of Liuye, the north wind that crossed the river suddenly became much fiercer. Even if you were lying in the cabin, you could hear the hunting sound of the sail being pulled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s snowing outside!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy is holding a bunch of snowflakes Enter the cabin and hand it to the 76th. But before I even had time to show it, the snowflake has melted into a cluster of crystal water drops. "There are white spots everywhere. I saw this big snow for the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy-six hard to sit up from the soft collapse, "Really? The morning glow of the Glory City rarely snows."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp But Takira never lacks heavy snow... She thinks that the demon moon is always on schedule, and it is a trouble to clean up the snow for several months. Fortunately, during this period, the devil will also suspend the pace of attack, making the world of white 显得 look a little so cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that the city of Glow is like spring," Amy’s eyes bent into a crescent. "Do you want to go to the deck to see? I can "Take you back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't make trouble," stopped the sword on the side of the boiled herbs. "Her injury is not good, can't blow the cold wind." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing," shook his head on the 76th "When I am healed, I will accompany you to enjoy the snow, what will it be? The city under the King's Majesty is closer to the west than here, and there will definitely be many beautiful snow scenes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;There was a sad look at the two people at the bedside, but Amy quickly recovered, and she nodded heavily. "Well, that's it!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventy-sixth knows what they are upset about... The gods have a strong ability to recover, and the skin wounds that do not hurt the internal organs can be self-sustained for only three or four days. In order to prevent the bottom Out, she personally own the femur and elbow hand crush into powder. In this way, even if it is such a strong body, it cannot be completely restored. However, in the eyes of outsiders, such a wound can survive if it survives. If there is no witch in the West, she will lose her ability to act forever, and the lower body will spend her time in the remnants and pains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 76th, this body is just a tool to complete the task. As long as she can return to the labyrinth, she can change a new one at any time. . As it turns out, the story she made has had a great effect, and Anne is full of guilt about her serious injury, which can be seen from the other's eyes and actions. The other witches are full of trust and gratitude, especially Amy, who is also a "black money" fugitive, is simply going to stick with her. Even when she slept at night, Amy would stay by her side and whispered a story told by the folks that she would fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this is the lively little girl who is the first to go to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting the witch’s trust is exactly what you want on the 76th. Only then can she deal with more witches and find out what Pasha Said the chosen person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This dressing change," broke the sword and walked to the bed with a jar. "It may be a little painful. It is better to close your eyes and not look." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't stand it, you change it," seventy-six clenched his teeth and put on a strong look - actually if she didn't stare at it It is impossible to know whether the broken sword has started to change the medicine. How do you cooperate with the other party's movements? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The herbal medicine after the smashing is like a sticky ooze. From the look of Amy and the broken sword, it is known that the taste of this soft mud is not too good. Good smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a small, confined cabin, it’s hard to stick to her wounds with this stuff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After tossing, the seventy-sixth breathed out and sweated back to the pillow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By raising the heartbeat, she can raise the temperature of the body, add blood, and secrete sweat. Coupled with the slightly trembling limbs and expressions, no one can tell that she is falsifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
