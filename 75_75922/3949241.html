			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning as the only professional with experience in the sea, is the unshirkable role of the navigator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she is also interested in this quirky and strange barge. Although it looks rough, but as a ship, there are some parts that are available. As for whether or not it can move, she is not sure. After all, when she was at sea, she was mostly a bystander, and her father always refused her request to take the helm or sail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the tradition of the new ship sailing, lightning shattered a can of ale on the bow and then ordered the sail. As a conductor, Carter is naturally reluctant to let the little girl snatch the position, so after she shouts, the Cavaliers will always follow the same order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sail of the township is made of animal skin, and the cowhide and sheepskin account for the majority, and some of the border town specialties, such as wolf skin bear skin class. So it looks like the color is different, brown and white, like a patch full of rags. The sail is trapezoidal, with four wooden sticks in the middle as beams, and the cable passes through the iron ring at the top of the mast and hangs down on the deck. As long as the cable is pulled, the entire sail can be raised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the operation as simple as possible, the two sails before and after the township are single sails, parallel to each other and perpendicular to the centerline. If the general brig is set up like this, it will cause a sail to eat very little, almost equivalent to losing its effect. But with Wendy's wind control ability, this design will evenly distribute the power on both sides of the centerline, which is more convenient for the steering wheel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning saw the completion of the sail, commanding the workers on the land to untie the hemp rope. The weather at this time was not bad. The sky occasionally had snow falling. Under the light wind and water flow, the boat slowly left the shore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl landed beside Brian and shouted: "Right full rudder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter also shouted: "Right full rudder!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what does the right full rudder mean?" Brian scratched his head, "turn right" How many laps?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, turn left to the bottom,” Lightning lifted his hand, “Oh, let me come.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She forgot that these people were the first to maneuver the sailboat, and even the basic instructions did not understand. If it is a standard catamaran, I am afraid that even the sails are not rolled out. It’s just that ten people are not there, and the stone boat can be made offshore. It can only be said that the design of the township is indeed unique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She holds the steering wheel handle higher than herself, her feet off the ground and spinning to one side - the huge horizontal steering wheel is very good for ordinary women Heavy, in the absence of mechanical assistance, equivalent to overcoming the resistance of the water to work, pulling the entire iron rudder surface below the bottom of the ship. But all this is not a problem for the lightning that can fly. She noticed that there was a blocking piece under the tiller to prevent turning over the head. I couldn't help but be curious. I heard that this ship was designed by the Prince's Hall. Why did he even know this detail? Be aware that even sailors who stay at sea all year round are not necessarily aware of the structure of the various parts of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When Wendy’s sister, get off the wind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty stood at the top of the shed and laughed. The original Highness asked if he had a fear of heights because of this reason. Use yourself to promote sailing? Thinking of the things that I usually do, such as drying the meat, blowing the robes, etc., suddenly produced a subtle contrast. She opened her hands and entered the state of practice on weekdays, letting the wind blow evenly from under her feet and overhead, as much as possible to make the wind on both sides of the sail equal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Wendy didn't expect this seemingly simple request to be so difficult to operate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she was awakened to witches fifteen years ago, she never tried to understand and control her power. Whether it is summoning a rapid airflow to wrap a stone to attack an enemy, or summoning a gust of wind to take away an enemy, it is a one-time release of a lot of magic. When dealing with chores in the camp, the wind is also big and small, as long as the purpose can be achieved. Now thinking of Anna's serious appearance when practicing, Wendy suddenly felt a little shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first thing you have to do is to practice your abilities repeatedly until you fully master it - just like Anna."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a set of words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
