			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clothes, shoes, cups, spoons, forks," Mey Fingers, "Is there anything else that needs to be taken in the past?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 708 items on the ground, big enough to reach the kettle, small enough Wooden bowls are available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bedding is the most important thing," Irene thought. "Pillows, bedding and padding are best brought with you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing this sentence, Rorschach and Gat showed a strange smile, and Mey’s cold eyes made the two immediately become expressionless. "Those things are No, Carter said that he would buy a new set in the market. It is said to be from the collection of the four major families, from the basement of the mansion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Wow, it must have been woven from fine silk," Irene admired. "I heard that Wang has a tailor shop selling pure silk-made clothing and fabrics, only big nobility and wealthy businessmen can afford it." If it is the collection of the four major families, it must be equal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, almost," Mey pretended to be distracted. He seems to have said that a set of five golden dragons is needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘶..." The three people took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Five, five Golden Dragons, God," Luo Xia said, "This is almost equivalent to my two-year salary."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you compare with the Star of the West," Gate knocked her head. "Miss May, but the celebrity who went to the king!" As for Carter, that is even more It is the chief knight of His Royal Highness, no matter from which point, it is not what we can achieve!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great, Ms. Mey," Ai There was a flash of light in Lynn’s eyes. "I really envy you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei knows that only her envy is free of impurities, from the very beginning It is this transparent feeling that attracts the dawn of dawn. She is also very strange, why a woman who grew up in a theater can cultivate such a character. Although she has put this relationship down, she still feels a little joyful when she sees Eileen’s sincere admiration. “When you are famous, you can buy it yourself... If you perform in Wangdu, you will pay a few Jinlong up and down, not to mention the rewards of the nobles afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But my acting wants to your extent, I don't know how long it will take," Irene snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the house is very lively, are you rehearsing?" The door was suddenly pushed open, and a handsome man appeared at the door." Is it not the time to come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Card, Carter!" Gat and Rocha immediately stalked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello Knight, hello," Irene smiled. "We are discussing what kind of supplies Mayi should bring to your residence, just now." Speaking of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it, what do you say?" Carter asked curiously in the back of his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing!" Mey gave him a look. This guy is always like this. If he doesn't talk well, he will be perfect in his temperament. Dispelled invisible, "How come you suddenly came, today is not a holiday?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, rest assured, I got the special permission of His Royal Highness Prince, and... ...I also brought a gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gift?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei glance When everyone was in a circle, Gat immediately got to know the truth. "Ah, Miss Mey, I just remembered that there are still some things to be busy. When you decide to dress, feel free to call me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am also, some clothes have not been washed in the bucket for several days." Luo Xia retired with the ceremony, and also took away Irene when she left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? I don't have anything, wait... I want to see Mei's gift..." The voice faded away, Mey Spit the gas, plug the door, and turn to look at the chief knight, "What gift? It will not be a new thing developed by His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
