			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty... Your Majesty, please think twice!" I haven’t seen anyone yet, and the mourning of the City Hall’s general manager has already rang out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Barov H. Herm went to the desk with a breathless breath, Roland just put down the teacup in his hand. "Think about it? Encourage the Grand Prix?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I mean... announced to all territories, you will marry a witch as a queen." The boss wiped the fine sweat on his forehead. While sneaking at the eyes of the king, "this fact is not right, squat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the notice is intended to be given to the City Hall, Roland knows the news. Absolutely it will make waves, so the reaction of the other party is not unexpected. If you want to remove the obstacle, the first thing to be unified is the voice of the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decision was made not because of his whim. After the end of the evil month, no Winter City troops will once again enter the fertile plains to remove the devil in Takira. The last stronghold. Coupled with spring farming, new construction plans, and trade, it can be said that the entire gray castle will be very busy in the coming year. If you follow the traditional charter, it will last for two or three months from the invitation of the guests to the official coronation, and the wedding will be longer. This is equivalent to disguising the productivity of the kingdom. It is no harm to do it in peacetime. It is obviously not a good choice today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this year there has been a rare peace, which will not only inspire the vitality of the people, but also do not need to make a big move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that Roland hopes to complete this promise earlier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as a feudal king who is in power, he can do it on his own. There are too many examples in history, no matter how absurd orders and seemingly impossible requirements can be realized under the ruler's will, not to mention that this is far less exaggerated. However, since the framework of the city hall was built by him, he would not want to dismantle it if he did not need it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using power within a rule is much more efficient than squandering it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why?" Roland knocked on the table and asked deliberately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, it’s the heir--" Barov hurriedly said, "The witch has no way to give birth. This is something that everyone knows, especially in the war. On the eve of the moment, if you have three long and two short, other nobles have to be eager to move, and the public can’t help it!” He swallowed. “If you just want to be with Anna, you don’t need it at all. Do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You just welcome A little aristocratic woman will do it," the general manager made a plan. "She can use it to plug the mouth of everyone, and when she needs to show up, it doesn't matter how you treat her in the future. With this layer of cover, you You can do what you want -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So Anna can't get this name?" The nightingale suddenly interrupted the other person's words, "just because she Is it a witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think Anna does not mind this. On the surface, Barov coughed twice, "If it is for the stability of the kingdom. If you can't open your mouth, I can deliver it on behalf of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not her, how do you know she won't mind? In terms of this relationship, I bet she never wants to see a beggar!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But it has nothing to do with feelings, but the successor..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough," Roland said, "Let’s say, just give Is it reasonable for the following people to have a reasonable venting vent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" venting... mouth?" Barov gave a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that the case?" He pretended to be careless. "After defeating the Pope, I took all of her life and didn't need anyone to inherit this." The throne, this is also the reason why I decided to welcome Anna. Unfortunately, only a few people, including you, know this. For those who do not understand the magic at all, if they don’t see it, they may be hard to believe. Because of this, it is only necessary to have a psychological sustenance, or to vent your mouth, to appease their uneasiness. Am I right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
