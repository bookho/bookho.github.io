			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver, who has been observing the battle, has finally breathed a sigh of relief. The devil’s first round of spears did not cause fatal injuries like the last time. With the help of the Worried Island Witch, the bone spear was either blocked or inexplicably lost. Only one hair was smashed on a heavy machine gun, and the spattered pieces made the team temporarily dumb. However, as long as the injury is dragged to the end of the battle, Nana Va will allow the soldiers to return to their original condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next round of madness still needs to wait for the arm to recover, but the first army will not stop shooting. In this distance, the devil stays longer, The higher the chance of shooting down, the winning and losing is basically a foregone conclusion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy seems to be aware of this as well. With a bang, the beasts that have not been shot down have turned around and began to accelerate to the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the dazzling offensive position, the opponent’s trajectory is much clearer when escaping. In the process, another fearful beast is discounted with wings and skewed. Slanting into the lost forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the enemy still has five flying devils - only three of them carry the madman! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi passed the message to the last ambush by listening to the seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they will also be the end of the entire operational plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning received," a familiar voice came from the other side of the print. "I want to go, please enjoy the performance of the great explorer!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Attention to safety..." When she had not finished speaking, she had heard the whistling wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a sign of falling into the sky, and it’s a sign of death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil who manipulates the beasts is absolutely unpredictable, and there will be people who attack on their heads - attacking opponents from the air is their inherent advantage, but This time, in the face of witches from above the clouds, their advantages no longer exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning quickly increased the speed to the limit of the windshield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hundred and twenty kilometers per hour! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Almost twice as much as the scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a little faster, the violent airflow is likely to overturn her goggles directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what she has to do is no different from bombing the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reorient the direction and cast the "bomb" to the devil in flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, the "bomb" she carried was ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addition of the Extraordinary is a temporary decision - because the ash can only control the movement of the flying magic stone up and down, it is impossible to fight alone, and it is too much to stay on the ground. Unfortunately, the little girl simply took her to action. This operation was unexpectedly smooth, and the ash that can float in the air will not bring any burden to the lightning, and the extraordinary physical quality of the extraordinary person will not affect her at high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the thick clouds, the scene in front of the two is suddenly clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five devils that Sylvie had instructed also came into view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until this moment, they still have not noticed the difference in the top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning is throwing the ashes against one of the devils! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter sword was unsheathed and rushed toward the target mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil responded when he heard the scream of the air, but it was too late - it swelled his arms, swayed the bone spear, and resisted The witch’s attack, but in the unstoppable shackles of the ash, the long sword not only broke the lance, but also went down the direction, splitting the helmet, the head and the torso into two. The last impression left in its field of vision is the golden pupil of the extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷——————嗷——————!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant beast that Madth incarnation finally rushed out of the clouds, toward the devil Dive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the astonishing ashes of the fighting power, the enemy finally puts the target on the bigger shape of the stubble - this can not be a real fear Beast, because her back is clearly equipped with a witch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spears were released, and the two shadows went towards the wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the next second, the beast will disappear without a trace, and the two spears will be completely empty, even the target fur is not stained. The original place where the beast was originally left was only a proud white pigeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between this electric light and flint, the nightingale has fallen to the enemy before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange nature of the foggy world limits her movements in the air, so that she can’t go as it was on the ground, but when she is only from the enemy When a "flash" is gone, the ending is already doomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale became the master of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil without the stone of the gods can't even see the enemy anywhere, and the back of the narrow beast is as wide as the square for the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While using the revolver to kill the devil, you don’t forget to pull the reins and control the mount to fly to the other beast that is already sluggish. The only surviving madman made the final struggle. It ignored the consequences of the arm and smashed two bone spears continuously to the nightingale. The magic stone that shines in blue light not only exhausted its magic, but also made it half. The shape of the body is ashamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the nightingale did not even do the dodging action, she directly turned the black and white world upside down, made the sky into the ground, then stood on the belly of the beast, let the latter With all the attacks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, the fog of the surging also caused one person and one beast to disappear, and in this case, the two beasts suddenly slammed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog will cover them in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the world where the devil has never set foot. The twisted objects and light and shadow make it forgotten to fight back, and when it comes back, those fine silver The contours have been rolled up like waves, and they are overwhelming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the enemy appears again, whether it is a flying beast or a madman, it becomes a piece of broken meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 re-converted to the behemoth, easily caught the falling nightingale, and on the other side, the ashes that solved the mount were also pushed by lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two to one, I won," the nightingale gestured a second to the extraordinary witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy shrugs, no choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the four people landed steadily, the lightning flashed out of the bag and listened to the seal. "Xilvi, you can find two other fleeing beasts." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was silence for a while. "Well, I saw them, it’s in the northeast, about five miles away." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, I will help you guide me in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want "Will a person go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And McMug. Don't worry," Lightning patted his chest. "But it's just two beasts without the owner." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They can't run one!" Mai changed back to the dove, and hula flew over the little girl's head and raised his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be aware of those gas tanks filled with red fog, don't stick them," said the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you encounter a new enemy, remember to retreat immediately," Ashes added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
