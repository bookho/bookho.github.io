			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star Sky Dome, Red Moon, Giant Painting... as Pasha described in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, the feeling is very grand, only when you are in it, you can really feel its vastness, no wonder they will Call this place the name of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is delivery? Still the sea of ​​consciousness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland squats down and gently strokes the floor - it looks like a stone, but the surface is smooth like a mirror, accurate fingertips It came with a cold, hard touch, as if what he saw was not a fictional fantasy, but a real existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after experiencing a realistic and exaggerated dream world, such a scene is no longer enough to scare him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked up to the dome - the huge red moon was covered like a circular piece of cake on the giant painting, and if you look at it, you can still see it. The surface of the surface is surging, and what is to be described is the sea. It is not as dazzling as the sun, and it is clear that it is red and red, but it always feels that it is not glowing. The red ripples are like waves, and like whirlpools, densely covered with the entire field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that the circle is too round. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not like a sphere, but a tiled circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the Red Moon is too close to himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland carefully looked at it for a while, and eventually couldn’t relate it to the red meteor that the astrologer observed—neither like a planet nor a star. If the battle of divineness really arises from it, how can it come to the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly had an idea in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the chief astrologer is a star-studded scholar to accept the revelation of the relics of the gods, can you confirm from the faintly flashing stars of the dome that this is really the red moon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is not excluded that the poorer old man was directly scared on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shrugged and stood up and looked around at the four giant paintings around the Red Moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne, the sea, the shady, and himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the scene of the third floor of the Loucheng underground hall, these records are all seen in the library of the Pontifical Temple, and there is nothing special about it. It's like a recorder that gives real-time feedback to the scenes around it. According to Pasha, the giant painting that was completely blacked out belonged to the underground civilization that was eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s own paintings and Wendy’s greetings, the latter two did not respond, apparently could not hear his shouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say good influence reality? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He approached the throne of the throne and reached out and touched the scroll itself - it felt like a smooth, smooth cloth, the texture was very fine, and the image above was only Just an image, he can't cross the border and enter the world of painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has no more new discoveries after a lap, and is planning to go out to the outside of the hall to find out if this place is really boundless, behind The picture suddenly heard a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this quiet environment, the sound is particularly clear, like the friction between steel, and the resounding of hard objects hitting the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, he felt the cold hair of his body stand up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, no one mentioned that these giant paintings can make a sound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped and jerked back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw that there was a dark armor warrior in the frame that showed the throne. It was sitting on the throne, and a pair of scarlet eyes were condescending. He swept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
