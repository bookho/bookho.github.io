			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gray geek roared toward the hillside, White thought he was It’s going to be finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only remaining thought in his heart is that he didn’t go so far to pull people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All blame the damn sailors! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the income of their savvy driver, and then join the transport army, why bother to take this risk into the woes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it not just to earn a few more silver wolves in the fierce competition? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the third time I met the real devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the devil is not counted - after all, he only has to run through other migrants, maybe he can survive, but the strange bird in the sky appears, it is Broke his last hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two legs also ran without a pair of wings, not to mention that he still had only one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, White holds his head in his hands, and his body is soft and falls to the ground. Seeing that I am your loyalty, please let me die. Going to the Kingdom of God you built, it is best to have a golden dragon that will never be used forever...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the strange bird did not tear him into pieces, but sent out A string of very familiar voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had heard a similar "cry" in Shenchi Bay - when the gray-bodied people’s weapons fired, these whistling sounds would Resounding throughout the battlefield, the last time it only sounded for less than two quarters of an hour, the fangs and the Redstone family seem to be incomprehensible, and the Guards will be completely wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it... Is the Grey Fortress to save him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White looked up cautiously and suddenly saw a scene that was unimaginable in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the strange bird’s head smashing a silver-white light whip—the whip seems to have its own consciousness, and the devil group walking back and forth in. And what it means, the snow is like a boiling, the devil is falling down, as if the flashing light contains endless power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wonder made him surprised and stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what makes White even more excited is that the devil is obviously also beaten by this sudden change. Not only did they stop the pace of chasing, but they also showed signs of collapse after the return of the fruitless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. White, then, what is that?" asked the refugees around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He subconsciously wants to shake his head, and suddenly an electric light flashes through his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White licked his thigh and forced himself to stand up and open his hands to the fleeers who had already been scared, and loudly in the tone of the voice. Shouted, "Don't be afraid, this is the gray castle escort I said before! I summoned them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Grey Fortress?" Refugees They are difficult to channel. "From heaven?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean... ...we are saved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case, but this escort is not free, it can even be said to be expensive! And my savings are limited, not Know when they will leave -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When White’s words have not been finished, they are interrupted by the crowds, "Don’t let them go! I am willing More than double the toll!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I add two silver wolves!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" As long as I can safely reach Shenchi Bay, I can give this gold ring to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of life and death, the fear caused them to explode with amazing action. The crowd that had been desperate for a while before could not move again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will tell the Grey Fortress, come with me now - hey, my feet are not very good, can someone carry me down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me come!" Soon a tall man hung him on his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, he does not have to worry about being killed when he flees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it goes well, maybe you can change the folded carriage back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for deceiving refugees... The most important thing now is to let everyone reinvigorate and escape from danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not panic, open your eyes, pay attention to the footprints left by others, don't roll down the mountain!" White commanded the man to take the lead and ran down the hillside . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode chased the devil for a while, only to notice that something was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flight team seems to have lost one aircraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the enemy has no power to fight, it is not so easy to want to smash all these thirty or forty devils. In addition to the influence of the weather, they are ultimately The firepower is a bit sparse, not even as dense as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled the fuselage over and over again, and could not help but burst into a cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the four planes, only the unicorn of His Royal Highness Princess is missing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides carrying only one person, her landline is basically the same as the Skyfire, and it is not surprising that it was ignored during the wind and snow battle. But at the moment, it was not at the time of reasoning. The other party was his sister, and once they had an accident, they had to eat and walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not yet had time to tell Finkin, three bright green spots appeared in the sky in the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the signal to discover the enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...the enemy is not here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gude’s heart suddenly became tight, and then he dropped the target of more than half of the death and injury and went straight in the direction of the signal bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, wait, where are you going? When you are a deserter, you have to go to the military court!" Fingin, who was sweeping himself, hadn’t returned yet. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say stupid things," Good said urgently. "Don't you find out, your Highness didn't come over!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finkin turned his head and suddenly took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously he also saw the three light spots that were slowly falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the previous search took into account the problem of inconvenient contact, the angle between the machines is not large, that is, less than half an hour, Gud arrived. Signal bomb location. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then relaxed a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biplane that is swooping down the ground is the Unicorn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Highness attacked was a group of devils hiding in the low woods. From the number of enemies, I am afraid more than the troops chasing the refugees. some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are there two devil forces in this area? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the chaser a smaller group? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode felt a little confused for a while, but the time for him to think about it, the back seat of Fingin has been excited to scream, "The enemy here is more Yeah! I am going up with my Highness and I can't help but press the trigger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
