			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dawn of the light crossed the city wall and shot into the inner city of Wangdu, the corners of the street were full of crowds onlookers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glowing City has never been as lively as it is today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different from the auctions where only wealthy businessmen and nobles participate. This is a "carnival" belonging to all the city people. They did not have any intersection with the upper-level big men, even the aristocratic entry-level knights, who are also unattainable in the eyes of everyone. Now they have the opportunity to witness the alternation of the highest levels of power, especially as the team of Count Quinn moves slowly, and they even create an illusion that they are driving the changing world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the term "rebellion" has gradually disappeared and replaced by "contention"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is the new master of the morning, will give a clear answer after this war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that in your mind, your fame and reputation are extraordinary," Hill Fox rides on the horse and the count, "I thought I was By the time you occupy the castle area, the public opinion will change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably I have reorganized the patrol and dealt with the life of the king’s house for the rest of my life. The old count said, "This is also the news you collected while running the circus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the other party is only a civilian without a title, And the identity of the performers of the Acrobatic Troupe is even lower than that of the free people, but Horford does not dare to despise each other. Listening to Andrea's statement, he is the agent of the King of Graysburg who has been placed in the Glow City, and his position is half higher than the ambassador. After the evacuation of Joel, Hill not only did not leave, but also operated several acrobatic groups, and in the absence of exposure, the eyes and ears were scattered to the streets of the city. In the face of those who have the ability and the trust of Roland, even if he is a count, he must show his basic respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, he still needs help from the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The will of the people is very important, adults." Hill nodded. "In the eyes of the big nobility, they may be just a dish of sand, or Lambs that provide taxes, but sometimes the sand can also collapse, and the lambs will also kill the herders. If this happens in the absence of a winter city, I think the results may be quite different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" The Count of Tokat, who was riding on the other side of the Prime Minister, was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as there is such a sign, you don't have to squat, the public has already reported the planner to the city hall," Hill smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hill...sir," Otto Locy’s friend Oro Tokat coughed twice and pointed to his body, "follow our team." The mouse behind you, are you looking for it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I just had a little friendship with their leader," Hill said calmly. "How, such a The voice that came to us was a lot bigger."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a mistake, the old count thinks that more than a thousand mice are putting on the "black money" Chamber of Commerce. After the leather armor was provided, it seemed to be a decent figure. Otherwise, the forty warriors alone and the attendants of Count and Tokat were really a little thin. But the mouse is a mouse after all, except that it is not used at all. He is a big aristocrat, but he has to accompany the black street mouse. This is quite uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, their two sides and three knives and the sky asking price are also famous, God knows what kind of agreement Hill and the other party reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't worry about this group of people changing on the spot?" Oro obviously couldn't help but say, "Be aware that betrayal is commonplace for them." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That also depends on what the chip is." Hill looked to Count Quinn, "I promised to give them the status of free people in your name." ——If you can become the Lord of the Morning, they can bid farewell to the precarious life and become the city of Glow Town who is sheltered by you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoffford I couldn't help but frown. "Although the mice are indeed disgusted and spurned by most people, what really degenerates them is poverty and hunger, not the recognition of others. Even if I exempt them from past sins, if they cannot fundamentally change this One point, then the identity given will be meaningless, and sooner or later they will become mice again one day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
