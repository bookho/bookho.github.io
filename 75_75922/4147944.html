			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think he will promise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the thunder’s footsteps went away, Roland asked the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," the nightingale slowly replied, "but his last sentence is serious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded and no longer answered. Let the Thunder leave the factor of lightning, he also has his own selfishness, as the fame of the fjord explorer, whether it is to attract the people of the fjord to vote, or to serve as the core of the fleet, the other is the most ideal candidate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially the latter--According to Ai Gesha’s inference, the red fog should have covered more than half of the winter, and when the first army is in place, I am afraid The wolf heart border cannot be spared. In such cases, rescue or flank strikes along the shoreline will be an essential part. From the case of the withdrawal of the North Port, it can be seen that a support fleet with strong firepower can relieve the pressure on the ground forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchant ships that come and go are seemingly orderly, but it is absolutely impossible to let them enter the red fog area and fight the devil. There is no big ship in the winter city. It is not difficult to come. What is lacking is a well-trained sailor and a person who can co-ordinate the fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Thunder are willing to stay, these problems will undoubtedly be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland also knows that this kind of thing can’t come, and can only wait for the other party to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phone suddenly rang when he lifted the pen and prepared to continue his previous work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the line, the caller is from the Witch Building inside the Castle District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I am Wendy," came over the receiver. A familiar voice, "Shoal Harbor inspection report, they found the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Excuse me, sir, where are you going to take us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deira took Momo’s hand and asked carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago, they, like other migrants, moved to the level along a long queue, but after entering the identity registration area, they were hacked. The clothing man alone left the team and entered a small room that looked like a transparent but guarded guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made the mood of the two men suddenly tightened up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has not heard of it. Some cities will screen out some people for special "interrogation" when checking the refugees. If they do not have the corresponding benefits, It will suffer a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the other party did nothing, just hanging them in the room for a while, then after asking some weird questions, they put them out. Leading to the inner city led by another black man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to be so polite, just call me," said the black man in a soft voice. "You are a witch, right?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily couldn’t help but be surprised. She didn’t expect the other person to point out her identity so straightforwardly. What’s more surprising is how did they identify their own magic? She thinks she has pretended to be good enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...what do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know anything about magic, yes The witches told me.” Soph touched the back of the head. “I heard that they can perceive the existence of magic through a special kind of stone. As for where to take you, of course, the place where the witch lives – you are along the way. It should be exhausted, rest assured, Wendy adults will take care of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily and Momo looked at each other and saw each other’s surprise different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is that Wintertown has the means to identify witches. If the church and the wolf-hearted aristocrats can do this, they may not live now. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the city at the western end of the Grey Fort, and its ruler Roland Wimbledon, the two were not mentioned to the owner. In the drifting process before boarding the ship, they have heard various arguments and rumors on many occasions. However, the content of the two is very different. One describes the king of the Grey Fort as a brutal and arrogant person. The so-called sowing of witches is only to satisfy their evil desires; the other is affirming the achievements of the new gray castle. The witches who have been there have lived the same life as ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that it is the second type of rumors that allowed them to make a decision to move south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the two places are separated by thousands of miles, no one knows what the real situation will be, so the two intend to hide their identity for a while, and then identify the truth. I made the next step, but I didn’t expect it to be winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the people here do not seem to treat the witch as a different kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they came to the outskirts of the castle area, a red-haired woman walked over with two little girls laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That will be handed over to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Wendy!" After paying a courtesy, Joseph waved his hand to the two and quickly turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dailan also quietly looked at the woman known as Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Wendy, there is no person in charge of the Winter City Witch Alliance. These two are my assistants, bells and gray rabbits." The other smiled. "Can you tell me your name? Although Daryl and Momo are on the roster, I want to hear from you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly I felt a feeling of spring breeze, and for a long time no one had spoken to her in such a gentle tone. The other side is more like a nobleman than the so-called nobles. Not only is the appearance mature and moving, the clothes are elegant, and even the temperament is different. It is just like the figure who came out of the picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Dai Lan." She whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Momo," the partner followed and said his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s all good names." Wendy pulled up the two men’s hands. "Welcome to the Winter City. From today, here is your new My home is coming. Come, I will take you to the place where you will live in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until through the walls and courtyard, Dylan discovered that the original lord castle was not The tallest building here, behind it, has a seemingly larger building. The two are separated by a spacious garden and lawn, and several well-dressed women are chatting together, and their faces are filled with a relaxed look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably, the life in your dreams is like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They...is it a witch?" Momo couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Wendy nodded. "If it's off work, you'll see more."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...Get off work?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the end of the work." Bell explained, "In the absence of Winter City, the Witch and Everyone has their own life to do every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Little girl pouting, "There is always diligence and laziness, this is the same as ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your sister did not tell you My ears are very spiritual?" A woman with pointed ears first looked at this side, then walked over with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah...Luojia sister, I am not talking about you," Bell quickly waved, "I mean -"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, have new members joined in the league?" Another person quickly followed. "Hello, my name is Mystery, and the head of the Winter Detectives is also an adult! If you have any ability, you can become a member of the Detective Corps. How are you interested?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
