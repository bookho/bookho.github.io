			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can't help but sink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This opening style is quite a bit like the legacy of the Federation’s fugitives – mortals cannot defeat the devil. Through handwritten handwriting, he can even feel the pessimism and despair of the writer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The world is so distorted, we are not aware of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowing the power of nature From the loopholes, most of the same kind still use it as a gift from God, just because it can bring extraordinary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately let us be lucky to be it One part also blinded us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s time to wake up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Although I don't know if everything is still available."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one opening, I saw Roland's eyelids jump, as the creator of the dream world, he always felt these The words are meant to be meant. Did someone discover that the world is just an illusory dream, I hope that everyone will wake up quickly? The problem is that he can return to reality after he wakes up. Where can these people go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the description of the power of nature, he feels the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensation brought by the avatar is even stronger than the power of the hand. It is difficult for the average person to associate the power he has with the disaster, even if the facts are clear. I will also resist thinking because of my disappointment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few dozen pages, the book did not explain the conclusion of the opening, but changed the direction - why only human beings can exert the power of nature . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the photos and abstracts are basically some modern scientific experiments and archaeological discoveries, and the descriptions are also returned to the book theme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is too much evidence that intelligence is not the key to awakening. In the long history, there have been both dementia and demon, and there have been natural martial arts. Aside from the arrogant intelligence, we are not essentially different from other animals. The genes are highly similar and the origins are the same. In the face of erosion, it should be the same as the cold-blooded reptiles that basking in the sun. Whether it is a frog, a snake or a lizard, The warm sunshine will be treated equally, but why isn't the power of nature not like this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because human beings are lucky on the road to evolution? Roland just came up with the idea and found that the writer seemed to guess his thoughts. "The vast majority of people will use lucky as an excuse, just like the past," but in fact, the earth is not the center of the universe, humans also It is not the only species that can use the power of nature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Overview of history, we can see that the record of civilization always shows a development of faults, such as it has been passed down to the present. In the mythology, the description of extraordinary ability is mostly concentrated in the period two thousand years ago - far later than the time that humans learned to record. It is as if we suddenly opened up and have an incredible power. The description of the enemy There are also more corresponding demons, ancient beasts, monsters, and aliens. They look different in shape, but they have one thing in common: that is, mortals are defeated in front of them, and only the awakened hero can be enemies." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although there is no direct evidence, I always believe that those aliens are not conceived by the ancients, but are a kind of reality. The species that have passed. Their abilities are the same as ours, so the myth of this period will be so lifelike."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reading here, some people may think that even Taikoo The mosquitoes of Ji Ji can save the corpses in the amber, but they don’t have them. This association is too far-fetched. But the reverse is to think that it is even more strange because they disappear too much. Isn’t it? There are so many in the world. The incredible relics, many buildings and human life habits are the opposite, and even some are not the works that people of that era can do, but we stubbornly divide the branches of which belong to the civilization, and count the credits Going to the local indigenous head, this is really too high to look at myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In order to find the answer, I visited those ruins. On this journey In the middle, I have some amazing discoveries - although the aliens do not leave bones or hair, the imprint on the stone does not disappear. In the secret room of a volcanic ruin, through the wall Sculpture, I saw a civilization of the past. "<br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
