			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, when Roland walked out of the bedroom and came to the castle hall, the connected Taqila witches raised their elbows to him. Take the highest courtesy of the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning, Your Majesty, thank you for your hospitality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last night can be said to be I have had the best experience in the past 100 years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will look forward to the next reunion with the dream in the decisive battle."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What happened last night?" Anna asked curiously after the demon witch with the happiness and satisfaction left the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A hearty high-end banquet." Roland laughed, and with the cooperation of Yan En, almost wiped nearly half of the food on the table. Thanks to this kind of dinner, it is not accounting for more than the guests. Even if it is thrown away, it will immediately fill the new meal, and it will be replaced by an ordinary self-service shop. I am afraid that it will be stared at by the waiter. After all, according to the rate of consumption of "invisible pockets", ten mouths are not enough to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Listen to me... I’m hungry." Anna’s belly snorted, “When can I eat those things?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the blue eyes that the other party is looking forward to, Roland can’t help but reach out and touch her head. “After a few years, it’s ok.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-end delicacies are mainly reflected in the ingredients, modern people can enjoy the taste of the mountains and seas from all over the world, relying on the developed transportation network. If you want to eat fresh sea urchins from Bishui Port without winter, you must at least double or triple the speed of the rivers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, even if the technology does not meet the requirements in a short period of time, as long as it can be hammered in the final battle, the devil will be completely driven out of the fertile plains, and then the seagull will be used. Honeymoons around the Grey Fort and enjoying specialty foods are also good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakfast is a regular baguette, plus a cup of chaotic drink, which is really tempting for Roland, who also had a drink in the sea. However, after thinking of the Takira witch, she still had to rely on the hot and dry food shaped like chewing wax to supplement the body's consumption. He still ate the things in the plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With breakfast, Anna quickly bid farewell to him and set off for the North Slope Research Office – whether it’s in Wintertown or on the front line, she rarely Free time. In fact, most members of the Witch Alliance are like this. Back in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows of the office, he can see the familiar figures passing through the vestibule from time to time. The witches are fully integrated into the city and are creating the future they want with ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the nightingale pushed open the door and walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A letter from the Daqing Port garrison." She put a thick paper bag on her desk. "I saw Xiao when I was downstairs." When I took this, I brought it with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So so heavy?" Roland picked up the paper cutter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It should have been shipped through the sea." The nightingale walked behind him and took out a bag of honey-dried fish from the drawer. "I have checked it." Nothing was found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland unpacked the paper bag and dumped the contents inside - in addition to the stationery and a stack of sketches, there were several bags. Sealed "stone". From the outside, it is basically similar to the sample presented by Rex last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly browsed through the contents of the letter and couldn’t help but frown. The report of the First Army surprised him. The so-called ancient ruins are not just a little bit of land in the submarine caves, but the normal state of the Cape! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving his order, the Daqing Port Garrison immediately took action. According to Mo Jinmin’s instructions, they buried a large amount of explosives above the cave. The entire top of the cave was blown up to the sky. The irritated armored giant smashed out of the ground, and then was attacked by several machine guns and mortar squads on uncovered sand. It was beaten into a horse's nest after ten steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This result is not unexpected. What is really unexpected is the next cleanup of exploration work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the First Army carried out several blasts and organized manpower to move the sand and dig holes. Finally, 16 exploration sites that could be dug into the "stickman relics" were found near Daqing Port, and if they were connected into a line, Covering a range of seven or eight seaports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of limited manpower, the sand people only cleared three collapses in a month, but the results were strikingly similar— - Both are covered with a "stone wall" of five to ten meters thick under the desert, and without a place filled with stone, you can see a cluster of green grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing those lifelike hand-painted scenes, Roland can't help but fall into silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to admit is that this is an excellent news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the stone is used as a resource for mining, the natural reserves are as good as possible. Now the stereotype work of the tracer has been completed. With this news, mass production is equal to With protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, there is more than one kind of peculiar piezoelectric silicide use. There are pressure gauges, lighters, quartz clocks, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a copy of the ritual cube - although the results of the exploration show that the number of radioactive relics is much smaller than the stickman, but a bunch of cubes are not a problem. Big, such as the sample returned this time, can almost meet the research needs of Celine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content that can be hidden under the report is chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only near Daqing Port, I found so many "stone monuments", how many stone monuments exist under the entire endless Cape? If you think of them as the remains of silicon-based creatures, the greater the number, the more fierce the battle of the genocide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the structure of the three collapsed soil layers is almost identical, indicating that they should be formed in the same period. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An incredible picture gradually formed in Roland’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the desertification of the extreme south is not caused by lack of water, Yinchuan is not a ground underground river at first, it was lush, no different from the rest of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until the war continues here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing number of stickmans were killed by the radiographers, and the bodies spread all over the road, covering the entire land. This can be confirmed from the murals of the Cursed Temple, which eventually captured the relics of the gods and won the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key lies in the end of the battle of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpses of silicon-based life do not decay as quickly as carbon-based, turning into nutrients in the soil, thus returning to the cycle of the biosphere. The layers of the body are stacked on the grass and may be thicker than several floors. The river was blocked, the woods were overwhelmed, and most of the plants lost their living space. Only the vines could climb up the gap and absorb the precious sunlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ecology of the extreme south was destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nature is always full of tolerance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether organic or inorganic, it will eventually become a part of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hundreds of years, the uppermost shell gradually weathered, became sand, and then scattered down. They move with the wind until they fill all the holes. In this process, the vines growing in the cracks continue to die, and only a large area of ​​open space that is not crushed by the stickman will survive the plants - a large number of them resist the erosion of sand and gravel Change to earth again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evolution of hundreds, even thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless bodies on the upper level that have piled up into deserts. They separate the lower bodies from the sea breeze and pile up the original coastline for more than ten meters. The flow effect of the sand dunes makes the pressure underneath constantly changing. The stone monument glows, extinguishes, illuminates, and extinguishes. This extremely long alternation does not guarantee the diversity of plants, but it allows some grasses with long growth cycles to survive. As for those open spaces, they became the Yinchuan Oasis and raised the Mojinsha people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
