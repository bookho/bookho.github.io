			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the construction plan, Roland arranged a equipment room at each well point to accommodate all the equipment needed for the three links for management. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complete equipment consists of a steam engine, an electric motor, a power supply, a boiler and two storage tanks. Adding a water tower outside the room constitutes the entire three-way system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steam engine is responsible for pumping well water into the water tower and the storage tank. The former mainly supplies domestic water to the house, and the latter is the heating water for the boiler. The first-class reservoir is higher than the ground, and there are limestone and washing stones suspended in the tank for precipitating magnesium and calcium ions in the water to play the role of soft water. The clarified water will be introduced into a lower-level secondary storage tank, and the floating material in the water will be stopped by a special filter made by Soroya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water supply to the boiler is completed by the electric motor. When the internal water level is too low, the float valve will be driven to open the motor to deliver water until the water level returns to normal. This process is more artificial than manual Adding or steam engine delivery is much more stable, and it eliminates the need to watch the station at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the water supply and heating have been pre-verified, the construction will naturally not have any difficulties. The key lies in the power supply system. For the town, it is still the first one. Suffered. Whether it is Karl or other members of the stonemason, it is definitely not clear about electricity, so Roland intends to make a small model in the courtyard first, and then explain it to the Ministry of Construction after success. After all, he does not know much about this, the circuit Knowledge basically stays at the high school level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a reliable and stable power supply, the first step should be to create a qualified electrical device, that is, a light bulb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Roland put on a thick coat and set off for the backyard of the North Hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fog of the nightingale, it took a quarter of an hour to reach the destination in just three or four minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the wooden door, Anna and Lucia immediately noticed him, but the former was busy with his hands and only nodded at him, the latter cheerfully I ran over, "His Royal Highness, good morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning," Roland nodded with a smile, then walked over to Anna. "Where are you busy?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new barrel and locking mechanism," she pointed carefully to the several long steel tubes on the table. "Your drawings are not too good." Reasonable, I think it would be better to change this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing my Na, Roland couldn’t help but reach out and want to touch each other’s head, but was back and forth Shake refused, oh... This scene seems to have been seen there. He coughed twice and conflated his mood. "Well, do what you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland doesn't mind her questioning her design. Her own firearms drawings are self-inferred according to the principle, and there is room for leakage and improvement. Too, not to mention Anna's own talent and ability to comprehend learning are far more than their own, he felt that one day, her understanding of knowledge will reach himself could not match the height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Anna put down the parts in her hand and walked to Roland, bowing her head slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃...Roland can’t help but have to make up the previous touch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to lick her soft hair, and Anna looked up with satisfaction. "Do you have something new to try?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...yes," the prince looked at Lucia. "How are you doing the separation of the messy ore in the mine?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Basically completed, the results are here," the latter handed a stack of books to him, "but the test mixed with steel may take a long time because There are too many elemental elements to be separated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is very good to be able to do this," Roland encouraged with praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also an extension of the material improvement program. Compared to the previous control of carbon content and the elimination of impurities to obtain high quality steel, the elements now involved have been expanded to The resources available throughout the northern slope mining area. There isn't a lot of cleverness in this part of the content, only a little bit to add to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
