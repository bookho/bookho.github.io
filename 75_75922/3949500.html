			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vader took off his patched jacket and put on a new uniform, he felt warmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surface of the clothes is thick leather, and there is a cotton lining inside, which not only has the warmth of the leather, but also the softness of the cloth. Expect, I am afraid it will be worth a few silver wolves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s similar in shape to the City Hall uniforms, but the colors are quite different – ​​the underpants are all black, with white stripes on the shoulders, neckline and cuffs. It looks very eye-catching. After fifteen people put on their new uniforms and stood up in a row, they couldn’t help but make their chests taller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Carter smiled with satisfaction. "Now come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This When the sky was still snowing, Wade was the first to see the snow from the fall. Jinsui City occasionally snows, but it will stop at the top for a day or two. Children often pile up snow dolls on the street, or throw them into snowballs to throw them away. Therefore, it is a saying that the snowy days are childhood festivals. . However, it is very inconvenient for adults. The snow will make the shoes wet and moldy, the streets will be difficult to walk, the shop business will be unattended, and occasionally the roof of the house will be crushed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the patrol is determined not to go out, but to go out and only find a pub, everyone sitting around the fireplace, while drinking warm The ale, while flirting with the maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all of this is not seen in Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day people clean up the snow on the street and sweep them to both sides - this is a long-term recruitment issued by the City Hall, which can be closed at the end of the day. , is a low return, fast money work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many townspeople coming and going on the street. Some of them wear straw hats and some wear cloaks, and they are busy with their work. If you remove all the snow in the town, it is no problem to say that it is summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t witness it, Vader will not believe that a small town on the border of the kingdom seems to be more busy than Jinsui, if not There are no towering churches and bell towers in the town. He really wants to think that he is staying in a big city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the group came to the dockside, there were more than ten sailboats parked in the Chishui River, and hundreds of people were gathered on the shore. Deja vu... Yes, Wade thought that when he arrived in the town with other fugitives from the east, it was such a sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Report! These people are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Refugees from the South and North, In order to allow them to spend the winter safely, His Highness specially sent people to call them to the town. The task is to help the city hall maintain order, let these people line up and check the checkpoints, and then quarantine and register. Commanded, "There are still few police officers, so there will be First Army soldiers to assist you. After that, this work will be done by you independently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't sound difficult, it is no different from directing refugees to queue up for porridge. Before Vader walked to the level, he began to scream loudly, let the people nearby listen to his own command, and they came together one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your name? Where do you come from? Are you good at reading texts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Every escaped pass through the level will be asked by the City Hall staff, and then roughly recorded. Vader knows that this is only a preliminary statistic. After everyone has settled down, there will be further review and verification. Those who have the expertise will be transferred to the inner city. This process has been experienced by himself. once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there was a commotion behind him, and Vader turned back and saw a man in a fluffy robe came to the dock area under the protection of a guard. The long, gray, gray hair showed his identity - the local lord, His Royal Highness Roland Wimbledon. In addition, he is standing next to several Chinese uniforms, and should be the directors of the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, His Royal Highness will come to see the refugees in the snow, which makes Vader a little surprised. In the cold season, few nobles are willing to Leave the warm bedgear early in the morning, especially if there is a servant to do everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
