He prepares three meals a day and then goes to the Executive Office to work. Farina is rarely out. Most of the time she stays in the house and does not move. Occasionally, he will ask him about the current situation of Hermes. Only then will the two talk a few more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe doesn’t know what Farina is thinking, but it’s already a great luck to be with her, but he doesn’t dare to Luxury is more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no movement behind the door today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farina, are you up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe has some doubts and knocks more A few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...there should be breakfast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farina?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still can’t get a response, just like there is no one in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe’s face suddenly changed, he suddenly thought of the worst possible –<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damn, Isn't it clear that a little bit is changing in the right direction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put down the plate and slammed his shoulders towards the door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, the door opens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most horrible sight did not appear - there was no hanging rope on the beam, and there was no blood on the bedside, which made Joe a little relieved, as long as the other Still alive, things will not be irreparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this luck only lasted for a while, his heart suddenly sinked to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furnishings in the small bedroom are clear at a glance, there is no shadow of Farina, the wooden bed, the table and the window have been carefully managed, it looks very tidy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——It’s as neat as the two people moved on the first day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe slowly walked to the table, this table was filled with a variety of books about the church and the Greysburg Weekly, but now, the desktop It’s already empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She...goed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this thought came into his mind, Joe felt a great sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously this is not a decision made by Farina suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She even wiped the dust off the corner of the table, but did not write a message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to bother to clean up the mess...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe numbly sat at the table Come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where will the other party go? Hermes? Once hometown? Still ending your life in a forest without people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can of course go looking for her... But, in such a big world, how much is his chance to find Farina? Moreover, the other party did not leave any news, and it was clear that it was hoped that it would disappear. What if he could find it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking about the future life, there will be no more women in the future. Joe feels that there is more space in his heart, and his thoughts are still stagnating. It seems that the brain resists to think again...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn't changed anything after all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why don't you notice this sign early, why is it complacent because of a peaceful life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, all this is just satisfying his needs, he Never thought about what the other party really needs -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until one With only one hand pushing Joe's face, he found that he didn't know when there was more than one person behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you talking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is Farina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was frowning and looked at him with a look of look. "Is there a problem with my head?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... didn't go?" Joe grabbed her arm in disbelief. "Or do you decide to stay again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ha?" Farina's look became more eccentric, but did not open his grip. "Which can't go, I just went to the Executive Office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two had a big eye for a while, and Joe shouted. "So...what are you going to the Executive Office?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ask for registration," Farina’s tone became serious. "I saw a notice from the weekly newspaper that no winter city recruited a truck driver and wanted to try it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Card...what?" Joe said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what it is, but the description should be similar to the carriage. I am good at riding or driving, so this may be an opportunity. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opportunity? The feeling of being detached once again caught up in Joe's heart, and he did not let go of his hands. "Why do you suddenly want to hire a truck driver?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina After a moment of silence, I began to say, "I have already thought about it after this time. First of all, the original intention of the church was to save the world from danger and lead mankind out of the darkness. This is not only a unilateral propaganda of the church, Roland Wen. Bouton also admitted that it was not a false statement. But the betrayal of the upper level made it a wrong way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next question is whether the king of the Grey Fortress is really fighting for humanity, as he said. In the absence of winter city, I I have seen the red moon symbolizing God's will, the rich and prosperous people, and the witches who are the same as ordinary people. These are basically the same as the propaganda. The only thing that cannot be proved is the devil who tries to destroy humanity."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kuta Master K. Thor did mention the existence of the devil in his will," Joe muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I just didn't see it, Roland's army is fighting this enemy from hell." Farina nodded, "I I don't want to make the same mistakes as before, only the things I have seen with my own eyes can be confirmed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to go to the wolf?" The eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Farina said calmly. "I can't pass the first military review of the church, so I can only change one way. Truck driver Need to transport the goods to the front line of the battlefield, where everything will be confirmed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she went to the Executive Office to ask the driver's identity request... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe asked cautiously, "If it is confirmed, what will happen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If everything is true, I will use the rest of my life to compensate for all the sins I have committed," Farina answered without hesitation. Obviously, she has already thought through it. "I did not personally arrest the witch, but it does not mean Everything the church has done in the past has nothing to do with me - as a member of the trial army, I am also the traitor of the traitor." She paused. "If these are scams, then I will return to Hermes. Can you help the new church to do something..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
