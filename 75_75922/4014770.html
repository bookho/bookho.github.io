			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Roland and the mortal woman left, Ai Gesha was loose. Tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you just say too much? Maybe you should be the lord and the lord after more than four hundred years, even if the other is a mortal. Although she thought so, she still didn't like people other than witches to step into the lab that was about to start making prints, and she didn't want her Majesty to know how to make prints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this later will soon be unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha turned and placed six square wooden boxes prepared in the morning, and put the stone of the gods collected under his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the template for making a stamp base. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things she needs to make are four listening notes, a screaming mark, and an insight mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she thought, her majesty did not choose a weapon-like imprint, but chose a more basic auxiliary seal based on the captured magic stone. The Quest, this act of using the high-quality magic stone left by the Demon Slayer for screaming and insightful printing is a waste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Roland has a powerful firearm, and the demand for weapons is naturally less intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention the more powerful the seal, the higher the demand for magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door knocked again outside the shed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that in addition to an independent research tower, it requires several servants. Ai Gesha reluctantly puts down the magic stone in his hand and opens the wooden door. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, what else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long wait, Ai Ge Miss Sha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, do you need me to treat the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time comes in Anna and Nanawa...and her assistant to Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...cough," she changed her mouth. "You have come just right. I just finished the screening work and put the rest of the materials in the box. We You can start the formal production."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the blue blood is spread When the layer hose flows into the wooden box, the god stone has undergone a wonderful change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two blend together and come up with a series of bubbles. The hard stone is like a burning candle, and the water chest is partially turned into a viscous liquid, then it is The god stone itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil seems to be aware of what they are doing, trying to struggle with the last effort, but unfortunately it has no effect under the shackles of a strong iron rope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the six boxes were filled with blood from the madman, and the box that was originally poured into the blood seemed to be boiling, and the surging liquid would be fine. The sand and mercury are mixed with the stone and look thick and turbid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna carefully observes their changes. "Is the quality of the prints related to the raw materials?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, it depends mainly on the blood of the gods and the blood of the magic. The Quest will think that the magic is the whole aspect of the transformation of the body. The physical quality of the high-level witch is obviously better than that of the ordinary witch, and the superior is above In this regard, the limit is reached. In order to improve the effect of the imprint, a good imprint will try to choose the blood of the powerful devil and the highest quality stone. For example, the gods of Akaris are printed on the battlefield. Completed by the dead sorcerer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will the witch's blood merge with the god stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not the same, the magic stone will not melt like a candle, the reaction is not so intense, the liquid after molding is as clear as water, can flow freely. And the devil's blood will eventually solidify and become like a stone. Hard," said Ai Gesha, putting a divider panel into the wooden box. Therefore, the process of making a seal is similar to that of smelting metal. It must be placed in the magic stone before it is completely solidified, and complete a crucial step - connecting the magic thread."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
