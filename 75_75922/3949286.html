			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland slept, the nightingale emerged from the fog, helping him to manage the quilt and cover the exposed arm. Standing on the edge of the bed and watching for a moment, silently passed through the floor and returned to his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't slept yet?" Seeing Wendy, who is still sitting at the bed reading, the nightingale is slightly unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid that you are doing something wrong!" Wendy glanced at her. "His temple is not a child. Is it necessary to take care of you until you fall asleep?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness has sent people to other towns to spread the news of witch organizations here. If the witch who heard the news intentionally harmed His Royal Highness, I will also be in case. Well.‚Äù The nightingale took the wet towel and wiped it off at random. Then he untied the red belt, the wrist leather armor, the draped buckle, and finally the white body. This set is a new work by His Royal Highness, pure white. The combination of the hooded jacket looks very eye-catching, but he thinks it is very suitable for the assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nightly hangs the clothes carefully and smoothes every fold. Her bumpy figure was wrapped in a gauze, and there was no trace of fat on the tight abdomen and thighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can be unexpected," Wendy put down the book in her hand. "There are sisters in the castle. There are guards outside." Again, you are not early. Did you put the stone under his pillow? You used to never touch that kind of thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I am also trying to keep him safe." "She sat down at the bed, took off her long boots, slender legs and raised her up, and turned her body to Wendy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you listening to what I said last time," Wendy sighed. "Vironica, we are witches." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, Wendy," nodded at night, "We are "witches." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And His Royal Highness will marry a witch - this is what he said personally, and... no lying.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this information is not a last resort, the nightingale will not be advertised. In the bottom of my heart, Wendy said sorry, she converted a topic: "Do you have any impression of the church? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why did you suddenly ask this? "Wenty snorted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" When Roland was in Fortress Castle, the church's high priest came to visit him and expressed his willingness to support him in taking the throne. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did he answer? Her voice was tense. "I asked you to go out before the conversation?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night screamed and shook his head, softly said: "He just yelled at me to avoid the scope of the other's demon stone." And His Royal Highness did not temporarily wear that thing. Wendy, His Highness did not agree to the church, he refused. "The latter breathed a sigh of relief, and then looked a little embarrassed. "Unfortunately, our help to His Highness is limited. Unlike the church, the power covers the entire continent." If Roland has promised them, I am afraid that I will be on the throne soon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows, His Highness said that the high priest was full of nonsense, could not believe it, "The nightingale paused. "I just care about something. I care. She said the red and black pills. "In the fog, the balls have the same color as the stone of the gods. This is incredible." Sisters have seen the end of the stone that swallowed God, and it is no different from suicide. The high priest said that it was a drug researched in the holy city prayer room. Have you heard of this institution in the monastery before? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the club left Silver City, Hakala led the nightingale, chasing the wind, and the stone girl trapped the villains that followed the bounty. And revenge on them - one way is to put the stone of the gods they wear into their mouths and force them to swallow. The villains who swallow the stone of death will soon die, and the whole body will shrink like a dehydration. Roll up, like a dried fish.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. Wendy closed her eyes and said slowly, "I remembered and lived in the monastery of the old holy city." There are high walls on all sides, and no other scenery besides the sky. The scope of activities throughout the day is in the hospital, and the literacy and knowledge are all long-term nuns. I still remember her name, Farion. One of the books she read for us was dedicated to the Old City. There were churches, monasteries, collections, memorial halls and heroic walls in the city, but there was never heard of the place of the Gods. I lived in the monastery for more than a decade until the accident happened..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
