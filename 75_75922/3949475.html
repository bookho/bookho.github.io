			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A grand celebration feast is being held in the lobby of the Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the witches, the city hall and the top of the first army were also attended, including Barov Mons and Carter Lannis, who were originally nobles. There are also iron axes and Camo Stern, who are of civilian origin. Especially the latter, Roland took a lot of tongues to pull him out of the lab and participate in this "meaningless" feast in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to let the people feel the same with themselves, in addition to public speeches, he also ordered the kitchen to use the refined starch left in the explosives and baked a large number of White bread, distributed to the people of the town - as long as the ID card, you can get a limited amount of delicious food in the town hall. When the first army was still on the way home, most of the people in the town already knew the victory of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they may not understand the purpose and significance of the expedition, but as long as there is free bread, it is a day worth celebrating for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the first time that Roland has modeled the "elegant" feast of the Wangdu model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a barbecue and chunks of stew, all food is cut into small pieces and served in a white plate. The pots placed on the side are filled with a variety of condiments, which can be tasted according to your own taste, similar to the cafeterias of later generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome back," he said, carrying two glasses of fruit wine to Anna. "It’s been hard all the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You have already said this, at the dock," Anna took the glass. "And my answer is the same, not hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The glasses touched each other slightly, and the girl's eyes were filled with sweet smiles. Roland resisted the urge to hug her on the spot and then toasted the other witches to celebrate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about me?" Lightning shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also have a share," Roland called the waiter for the wine, and took off a glass of cider, "hard work."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to drink white!" The little girl looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." He thought about it and finally agreed to the other party’s request. The curiosity of this little devil is always very strong. If she refuses, she might be I will learn the look of the nightingale and sneak into the kitchen to steal alcohol. "Well, but only have a drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland handed her a low-alcoholic white wine with ice and grape juice, she suddenly got together and kissed him on his cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough... Is this the etiquette of the fjord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Lightning nodded hard, "My dad said!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it wasn’t the first glimpse, the witches didn’t feel too weird, but Sylvie When the eyes widened, and then they looked at Roland with their complaints, and the latter saw the head open quite awkwardly - did the fjord really have such a ritual to kiss the leader at the celebration party? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to toast their own men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was his turn to be the chief alchemist, he replied in a low voice. "His Highness, I have read "Second Chemistry" for me twice. But there are still many unknowns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It tells the microscopic composition of matter, this part involves a lot of physics, you have to join another book Look." Roland pointed out. "I suggest that you read all the "Elementary Physics" first, then read the chemical residues from scratch, so that many doubts can be answered."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did this too, but..." He hesitated. "His Royal Highness, why do the colors of the covers of each ancient book have different colors? Do they have any special meaning?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Roland indulged for a moment, "Color represents its level and ease of access."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
