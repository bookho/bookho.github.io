Joe took a moment to realize what the other person’s identity represented and finally understood what he was when he first met. Where does the inexplicable familiarity come from, just – how is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...can't understand, you should be bravely killed in a fierce defensive battle..." Farina swallowed, " Moreover, the sacred warrior is a devout warrior who gives both mind and body to the gods. They almost never--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Never speak, just like dumb?" Zoe interrupted. "This has nothing to do with piety. They can't talk because their brains have been cleaned. If they don't, they can't be a qualified body for us to use." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body? use? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the hell are you talking about..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will ask you first, the church is How to promote the gods of the penalty force?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe replied first, "The warrior who gains the power of the gods, the nemesis of the evil witch, is also the greatest hope for the church to save the world. Only a firm and fearless believer can have this honor." He paused a little. "We used to think that saving the world is to keep the big gap and prevent the evil beast from invading the mainland, but in the suicide note of the Tok Taal, we Only then did the battle of the gods and the devil exist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the gods are actually a special force against the devil," Farina received Dao, "Only the Hermes Privy Council knows how the conversion ceremony will take place, but now it has been ruined by Roland Wimbledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It sounds really touching, but unfortunately there is no truth." Zoe smiled slyly. "Your so-called gods are made." The sole purpose is to suppress the witch and maintain the rule of the ruling power. Although the source of all this is really to continue humanity, the planners are not the church at all, but the witch is right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina looks like an unbelievable look. If the other person is not the famous Ainova, her idol, she will definitely refute it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe took a deep breath. "Can you...and tell us in detail?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Well, let me satisfy your curiosity, mortal." Zoe raised his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the other party stopped talking, Farina felt a thorn in the fingers Pain - I don't know when she has clenched her fists and the broken fingers ooze again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally understands why the characters in the historical biography are so real in front of her. In front of Ainova is not the head of the trial army, but an ancient witch who has continued from more than 400 years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in peacetime, she will shout loudly, and at the same time pull the sword and fight against each other, even if it is impossible to win, can not let the evil person control the body of Yingjie . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, she feels that her strength is passing from her fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really ridiculous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the other party’s statement, it is the witch who created it all by himself. Devil's minions? The embodiment of evil? Jokes, they are all dedicated to human beings, and they are truly fearless heroes! The daring of the Queen of Stars, who is willing to sacrifice, has surpassed most people in the world... Is there anything more ironic than this? The goal that is proud of in my heart is set by the witch who is hostile to myself; the transformation ceremony that I long for is only the body that the witch uses; even the world has become the present, and it is inseparable from the witch. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retorted her quickly, saying that these are fake and fabricated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was a voice in his heart, Farina opened her mouth, but she couldn’t say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the rumors that the martial arts warriors disappeared bizarrely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, what is the main female body that has been drained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the large monastery in the old holy city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, those who look like witches are innocent...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the lie can be strict At this point, at least you have to lurk in the church for more than a decade, and can reach the core secrets of the Privy Council. At present, those who can meet these conditions are probably only the pope of all ages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, there is a decisive piece of evidence, that is, "power." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the ultimate goal of the warrior is to fight against the devil, there is no doubt that the stronger the better. And the intelligent life with the knowledge of God is always much stronger than the beast without the gods. This is undoubtedly the proof that the two castles can easily conquer the castle of Dagong Island guarded by the gods. If the witch and the body of the gods are so fit, why should the church kill them, instead of making good use of them? Even if the wild witch is extremely evil, the pure person should always be right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the truth is, Hermes has never seen a god witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has reached a conclusion in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure people can be controlled with the god stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no means by which the church can restrict a witch who is equivalent to a supernatural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So even if the latter is stronger, it will not be considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Majesty in the Holy City is truly dedicated to humanity, she believes that there are many believers who are willing to devote themselves, and it is not surprising that several witches appear among them. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from the beginning, the Holy City cut this possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saving the world is not as important as their promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......It’s just like the other person’s ridicule. She’s powerless to think that the warrior is not the ace of the devil, but the tool used to suppress the witch. Only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe is clearly aware of this contradiction, he cautiously asked, "How many people like you are in the winter city?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hundreds," Zoe shrugged. "They are all the shells you contributed. Later, you meet a familiar person, don't make a fuss."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina vaguely guessed why Joe asked this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one or two "sacrifice" gods can be impersonated by a witch, hundreds are impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party can answer so calmly, which is a kind of evidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the last trace of luck, there is nothing left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina felt that something was slowly drifting away from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is eager to be felt by people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church originally carried light and hope. As a member of the church, she naturally shoulders these things - behind her are the four kingdoms and all human beings, but now They are peeling off a little bit, like a mottled weathered wall. And after the wall... nothing, just like the emptiness of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She must...do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Church...the church can change this result...get everything back on track..." Farina said hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Zoe looked at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Devil's Witch Plan...Need the body, right? Only the church can provide you, like me--" She took a deep breath, "I am willing Take the lead in the conversion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
