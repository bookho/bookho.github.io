			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real... Brother? How can this be? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tillie holds the letterhead, but the mind is completely unable to concentrate, and the thoughts in the brain are like a flood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the five children of his father, Wimbledon III, Goron, Tefco and Garcia were considered to be in a circle because they were born earlier. When Roland was born, the youngest Garcia was six years old, and naturally he would not bring him to play. It stands to reason that you should form another circle with Roland, but... in fact it is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her brother is very much looking forward to the two brothers, trying to integrate into their circles, the result is often the one being bullied. This led to Roland's character becoming distorted and irritating. Of course, this anger did not dare to release them to Goron, and finally he could only vent to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if you make yourself steal the crown of your father, you will be insulted by anger and anger, and sometimes you will be in the same position. Later, he was discovered by his father. After a few lessons, he converges a lot, but all kinds of small actions that threaten her are still not done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things may not be understood at the time, but now, in retrospect, Tilly only feels quite ridiculous and... childish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until ten years old, she found a broken piece in her beloved shoes, and finally decided to fight back. She called Roland, and when he threatened himself, he directly put the cockroach into his mouth - since then, the other party has never taken the initiative to provoke himself, and she is not willing to take care of this brother again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After growing up, Roland still hasn’t changed, even worsened. She often hears about his deeds. In the rumors of the nobility, he is violent, mean, If you don't learn nothing, you can be regarded as the noblest who is the least noble. Nothing except the royal identity. For this evaluation, Tilly deeply agrees... and she also knows that the other's temper and irritability are strong representations, in order to cover up his greatest weaknesses - timidity and cowardice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, such a person would actually stand on the side of the witch and shelter a group of aliens known as the devil's minions, even at the expense of the church? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly didn’t know what to say for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tilly, Tilly?" She didn't come back until the ashes shook her twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm fine, just a little...unbelievable," she shook her head. "Silvi said that the town's lord is probably true Roland. Don't be the person controlled or replaced by the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, that sneak peek at my stupidity--cough, guy?" The ashes coughed twice. "He did change a lot. He didn't see it for a year. Besides the appearance and the impression, I felt like I was watching another person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you say a little more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early thought for a long time, "I think... the biggest difference should be clean. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether it's dressing... or giving people a feeling." He doesn't like jewelry like other nobles. Whether it's gold, silver or gems, there isn't one on him." Ashes recalls, "even clothes are very common style, look more Loose, without lace, hanging ornaments and gold silk. If it is not his hair color is too conspicuous, it is almost the same as ordinary people. But... he is not like ordinary people at all.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like aristocracy? Tilly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not like aristocrats," Ashes mouth, "No one is clean, not a pool of stagnant water, that is Silt covered by dead water. As for him... I can’t say it, but it’s not bad. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard to believe that you will speak for him." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I just want to answer your questions seriously." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
