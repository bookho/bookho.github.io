			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia stared at the circle on the ground for a while. "You want to let it cycle, you need to keep investing money... In general, still A large part is not in the hands of the Grand Chief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The key is here...and I thought for a long time to understand, this is the biggest for him and other nobles. The difference," Andrea painted another big circle, including all the small circles. "He used to regard the entire gray fort as his own territory from the beginning, so this flowing wealth is no matter All the cities assigned to it belong to him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But he is a king, isn’t it right?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the flames are still at the head of the clan, can your orders govern the tribes in the Yinchuan oasis?" Andrea asked, "even the Iron Sands is not a flame." The family has the final say. For the four kingdoms, the situation is similar, and the aristocrats are equivalent to tribal leaders. It is not allowed for outsiders to intervene in the affairs of the territory, nor will they regard the land of others as their home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Luo Jia was silent for a little while "This is not something that can be decided by different opinions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, you are much smarter than the ashes, and try to be less with her in the future. This will affect your ability to think." Andrea patted her on the shoulder. "This requires the dual support of strength and policy. The former makes the division of the nobles discouraged, while the latter can concentrate power in the hands of the king." It’s a pioneering work, and it’s hard not only to have such an idea in Roland’s Majesty, but also to move closer to it from the beginning. After spending a long time in the Winter City, I’ve become more and more aware that such details are numerous.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a bit...complex." Luo Jia touched his head and secretly surprised. I didn't expect this to seem to be rejected thousands of miles away. When a blonde woman talks about such a problem, she will answer so carefully. It is difficult for her to share these findings with others, but she has been suffering from no one can tell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, politics is 10,000 times more complicated than fighting," Andrea said triumphantly. "And this is just one of them. Another point is, What he has gained is not only the growing wealth, but also—you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is a lot simpler. The migrants who get food and housing through work become part of this cycle. You will gradually get used to this life and use your salary for more comfortable enjoyment, and then You can't get out of it. In the end, you will become a Grey Fortress, not a nominal one, but his true people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Delia put the stick into the ground and took a clapping and stood up. "This process is certain, the oasis is shrinking, and many tribes are threatened by survival. Now there is no need to kill each other to survive. Method, migration is a matter of time. And the land in the south due to war and ruin More, instead of continuing to let it go vacant, it is better to hand it over to the Shamins – this is also producing wealth for him.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of her here Don't you understand now? With this method, after 20 years, Roland will not only get the black water he wants, but also the wealth of the cycle, including the majority of the Mojin people in the extreme south - and buy* *Get up, do you still think the former is more cost-effective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia did not answer, she suddenly felt something was touched in my heart. Compared with the problem itself, the attitude of the other party makes her care more. The reason why Andrea does not hide is not because she trusts herself, but even if she knows it, it doesn't matter, whether it is accepted or not, the result cannot be changed. It is like a waterfall rushing down from the cliffs of Wanzhang, and its potential is unstoppable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sturdy and unstoppable force. It can integrate the situation, the heart and the power, and take all of this into such a far-reaching situation. It is inevitable that strokes will be avoided. It is worth admiring the people who see through this layout, not to mention the initiators. If the chieftain is born in Tiesha, he must be an outstanding warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is the direction of her efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your guidance, I feel that my martial arts has taken another step forward!" Luo Jia clenched his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
