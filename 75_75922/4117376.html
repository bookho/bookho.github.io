			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until after the dream world, Roland can still feel the coolness behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay?" The nightingale, who was chewing on a snack at his desk, saw him wake up, and a momentary flight flew to the side of the recliner. What's the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the familiar face and concern of the other person, the feeling of depression in the aliens dissipated a lot. He was very angry and smiled. "There is no problem, just some new discoveries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale reveals a suspicious look, "Is it really? Yours The face didn't look normal." She said that she reached out and touched Roland's forehead. "You see... all sweating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At this time Roland found that the coolness of the back comes from the slightly wet lining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You know that I don't lie, it's just a dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his emboldened Not as arrogant as I expected, the dream world is becoming more and more complex, or more and more like a real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know." Night grin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Discriminating lies is also necessary to be effective in order to take effect," she said. "You are now more than the king of the Grey Fort, or the leader of the Taqila ancient witch and the sleeping charm. Even the morning kingdom is willing to listen to your drive. The status has surpassed the general king, the secrets of the future. It will only be more and more, if I know everything... but it will be less comfortable." She paused. "You don't like it...what is the feeling of being seen by others?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the nightingale that deliberately turned away from sight, Roland couldn’t help but laugh, and even the last point was heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can probably guess the thoughts in the other person’s mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the superiors do not want the subordinates to know too much, the ambiguous attitude and the maintenance of mystery itself is an emperor technique, no matter the East and West, know too much Generally, there is no good end. The nightingale must know that he will not do this, so usually only the road to alienation can be left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's so funny," she said, biting her two dry fish. "I was worried about what trouble you were having."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," Roland converges with a smile, a serious saying, "Indeed, no one likes to be seen by others, especially those in power -" he deliberately paused for a moment, "But you are not "others". "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is not a feudal king in the true sense.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because standing in the long history After looking at the ups and downs of many dynasties, he became more aware of what he really wanted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magnificent cause must have a group of people who truly trust him to complete .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诶? "The nightingale can't help but be stiff.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't come to the town, I guess I have already died in the hands of the maids sent by the three sisters." Roland said slowly, "Why wait for the war of divineism to start, the crisis situation will definitely be more, the kingdom will not be a piece of iron, and you have to be busy - all of them are here, I can still Will you be an outsider? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This era is not without merit at all. If you change to later generations, he can only exchange a single eye at most.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Again, the most terrible lie is not to deceive others, but to deceive yourself. If you are there, I don't have to worry about this at least. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale muttered to the head. "My ability has no way to stop you from deceiving yourself." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course you can do it, can you feel a degree of insincereness?" For example, 30% hesitant cover, and downright lies. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, if you want to force yourself to be confident when you are not sure, you are deceiving yourself. Sometimes, the former is even more harmful than the latter. At this point, as long as you remind me, maybe It’s OK to be able to save a big mistake.” Roland said, “How do you know how important your duties are now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The nightingale was silent for a moment." "I will ask you once again, this time I will use the ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland made a gesture of please . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really don't matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what she most wants to determine is still Your own safety...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland replied with a smile, "Oh, this is really no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing this sentence, the nightingale is also relieved, "What is the new discovery you said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is It’s what I’m going to announce to the entire commander of the united front—” He got up and walked over to his desk and picked up the phone to the third side of the city. “I saw the memory of the devil.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the way things go," Roland repeated the story in the dream world. But hide the message from the martial arts books and the red note. "Do you have any opinion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa in the light curtain takes the lead Channel, "The significance of this intelligence is extremely important. No. No one has been able to go deep into the city of the devil, but to come back alive, you are the first in history - although in a dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light With these contents, you will be able to get the meeting of the three seats of the federation," Aer's rare singer did not sing the opposite, and the voice seemed quite excited. "The original devil was able to gain strength by merging the magic stone, so that many Questions can be answered!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, especially from the magic stone," said the most secretive of the magical Catherine, "Since the madness can make such a big change, we can infer that the high-order devil should have been born in a similar way - as long as they are merged into a certain number of magic stones, they can become completely different species. The change is not from the blood heritage, but from the sudden change in power. This also explains why the high-order devil has so many different abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I There is a problem, "The sleeping spell "? Such an upper limit of strengthening it" sleeve Tilly asked, <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; then let her Chamber there was a brief silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Serin replied, "I am afraid not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Are they stronger than the extraordinary?" Wendy frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It can't be compared," Sailing shook the Lord. "Do you remember the last words left by the underground civilization? The magic road is the god of the gods." Road, one day, we will be no different from the gods. In other words, as long as we continue to improve the control and understanding of the magic, there will be no end to growth - whether it is for the witch, or for the devil or the underground civilization. The road is full of thorns and it is not so easy to reach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the contrary, this news is good for us. The birth of blood means stability. Growth, the high-end devil that can be squatted for four hundred years is definitely a horrible number," said Celine. "Fortunately, we now know that they also need to be resigned. In addition, from the information of the sire, the probability of success is promoted. It should not be too high, otherwise the reaction of the devil would not be so strong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a witch who has been fighting the devil for a lifetime, Roland thought, can Analyze from such a scene So much intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am more worried about the rumors than the new promoters," Pasha once again said in a voice he could only hear. Your findings can be said to have proven it in a sense - so I feel very uneasy, why would anyone do something like this? I always feel that the battle of divineness may not be as simple as we think." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
