			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vader turned to get out of bed and tried to move down. There was no pain in the back. It seems that the Cavaliers are right. If the wound is left, it will heal quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you not rest for a few more days?" asked Culkasim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He only gave me two days," Vader put on a dilapidated coat and put his feet in the cold boots. "And one day earlier." To work for them, I can get porridge early. I can't always eat you, then a bowl is not enough for two people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think Very good, the porridge here is much thicker than the remedies in other places, and you can taste a bit of meat." The old man shook his head. "Children, you used to be patrols, you may not know the life of the slums." The porridge water there is the same as the broth, but there are a few grains of wheat in the soup. In order to make it look full, it is often filled with grass roots or leaves to cook together. The porridge of the Lord's adult is divided into two or maybe eaten. Not full, but it won't be hungry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to have both of us full," he tied his shoelaces and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Kukasim sighed. "Then you pay attention to your body, don't be stubborn."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange feeling, obviously he is just a scapegoat selected by the Black Street Mouse, and now it seems to be his own elder, Vader thinks. Even more strange is that I actually feel that this feeling is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will," he shook his head in a funny way, wearing a hood. "You too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just opened the door, I saw two men standing outside the door, the white uniform embroidered with light blue shoulders and armbands showed the identity of the coming people - they are the clerk of the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide's brow couldn't help but wrinkle. "Who are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them pulled out Zhang The paper swept away. "You are Vader?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What happened?” Kukasim also noticed the situation outside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Congratulations,” another person smiled. “You have passed the paper test of the public security team, and then it will be a week of comprehensive training,” he said. Deliver a small card to Vader. "This is your temporary ID card, take it to the Second Army Camp, where someone will receive you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The latter widened his eyes. "I...had passed the examination of the lord?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet," the clerk replied. "The paper test is only the first round of screening. You have to complete the training and get the approval of the chief knight. Through the assessment, become a formal public security team member. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two left after they finished speaking. They didn't ask for coins or feelings. They just seemed to make a special trip to inform him.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have succeeded! The old man glared at Vader's shoulder with excitement. "When you said something, you can never be selected." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vader snorted for a long time, "because those questions are really weird." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man gave a slight glimpse, "What is the problem?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't help but recall what happened a week ago, since he learned that His Royal Highness had recruited the public security team - that is, after changing his name to the patrol guard, he According to the requirements of the announcement, he was recruited to the City Hall. The other party responded quite quickly. After only five days, he received a test notice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vader is confident in this Not only does it fully meet the conditions on the announcement, but it also has more than five years of practical experience, and the town does lack the supervisors of the people, and it is highly likely that they will be selected. If they can become patrols, even live. In the inner city, you can also help to Kukasim at any time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not expect that the test exceeded everyone’s expectations from the beginning.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
