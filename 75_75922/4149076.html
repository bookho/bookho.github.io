			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Roland received the report signed by the First Army and the head of the General Staff Department, he immediately thought of the classic plot of those spy films. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously this is a very viable option. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He even considered more than Isis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spy profession, despite its ancient existence, has had different names in different periods, but the concepts and images he knew were not formed until the Second World War. . Most of the previous intelligence transmissions were simple two-line connections, and no strict system was developed. As government agencies become more and more powerful in controlling people under the rule, eyeliners and spies are more and more difficult to survive, and they become complicated and systematic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means that the loose control system that divides the lord as the ruler fundamentally cannot eradicate the existence of spies. As long as the spy personnel are trained in some of the most basic professional knowledge, the upper and lower lines will be cut off. According to their weak anti-awareness and means, even if the whole city is turned over, it is impossible to touch the tail of the lurking person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, for the downline that provides intelligence, the online is simply a shadow figure that has never been seen before, and it is replaced by a nightingale and canâ€™t ask anything. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland immediately approved the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he does not intend to hand over the matter to the hands of Itis, which has nothing to do with trust, but espionage requires a lot of effort to plan and arrange. He pays more attention to the strategy of the North Pearl and the overall situation of this era, and if the energy is used in such matters, some of the reasons are reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional things can be done to professional people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spread a new stationery and wrote the name of Hill Fox at the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political situation in the morning has been basically stable. The circus leader should have been bored and bored? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the nightingale handed the letter to the honey, Roland began to think about another thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the intelligence network. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news that he had to deal with at the beginning, whether it was war or political affairs, was basically limited to the gray fort. From the expedition to Takira, the flight courier had a significant delay. Fortunately, the Seagull glider could travel to and from the front line one day, which was acceptable as a supplement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now the main battlefield has become a wolf heart and a winter, the inconvenience of communication is particularly prominent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the report at hand was delivered to the owner by sea, but the date of the payment was one week ago. The reply with the animal messenger will be a lot faster, but it will still be inevitable for two or three days. More critically, the messenger capable of flying over a long distance of more than a thousand kilometers, honey is not controlled much - after all, she can only let animals take orders from themselves, but can not change their inherent habits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, even if it's a short-distance messenger, there is a limit to the number. The magic of honey is not enough to support the communication needs of the entire West, let alone the country and the country. . When the spies start to operate, how to pass the information safely and quickly is also a major problem to be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is clear that the ultimate solution is radio communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of cable telegraph is simpler, but it is limited by the attenuation of the line. It is not fundamentally different from the phone used now. Even if the distance is doubled, it is only one. A hundred kilometers, if you grow up, you have to add a relay - such as a tube that can amplify the signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that if he can make a tube, the radio is no longer out of reach. We must know that there is no concept of electromagnetic pollution at all in this era. The modulated electromagnetic waves are like the babies of the silent night. As long as the transmitting antennas are set up on the mountains, it is not difficult to pass thousands of kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the radiotelegram can be successfully manufactured, the frontline report can be sent to his desk in just a few minutes. If you go further, you can put the portable radiotelegraph If the whole army is assembled, its strategic significance is no less than the dawn plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
