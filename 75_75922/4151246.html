			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you humans are both short-lived and forgetful..." Wajilis seemed to have recovered a sense of superiority and unconsciously picked up the coffee. "As long as you have been in a few decades, history can be replaced by lies. Such things are almost unimaginable for my family who have a long life. You seem to have completely forgotten, no matter how gratifying the lies are, it is a lie." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To each other." Roland pointed at each other. "Don't you also neglect the warnings of Sistalis? In addition to the people who were in the past, I am afraid of the new generation." Didn’t the devil know about it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiri’s mouth opened, but he couldn’t pick up the words, and finally he could only drink coffee. This is equivalent to having defaulted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We might as well make a speculation," he re-raised the topic to betray the gods, "maybe the "magic shape" seen thousands of years ago, and The dream of the dream world is the same person. Unfortunately, your tutor could not form a fixed field in the ideology, so I didn't get the exact hint. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you believe what God has made?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe what I have seen - the enemy who claims to be a servant of the gods is eroding the world, and in reality, it has indeed discovered the legacy of the past civilization." remains. I don't know where the victorious civilizations have gone, but the truth is, they have never returned, don't you think this is strange? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe there is a better world that is more suitable for the upgraded race -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The source of magic? Roland said ironically, "Upgrading is a road to becoming a god. However, after becoming a god, there is no way to freely travel to and from home. What kind of god is this?" And when you are close to the source of magic, that is, the erosion of the crack, will you make you feel good and comfortable? If that's the case, you should have jumped in before you are right. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy...sanely sent the witch to follow her all the way. Wakiri slyly thought, but couldn’t make a rebuttal at the mouth, standing at the scarlet Before the crack, it only felt a strong danger.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What if you can change?" "Silent for a long time, the nightmare whispered. "Everything is too late. If you are a member of the Yunxiao School, this speculation will be one thousand years earlier, and there may be a chance to reverse the situation. But when my family got the inheritance of the third civilization, the war could not be stopped. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third civilization...the estimate is the underground civilization. Roland can't help but slow down the speed of speech. "The so-called inheritance... What is going on?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris groaned and then chuckled. "What? You didn't have any inheritance fragments at all." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Answer the question! Felice sighed low.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We don't need any debris, and we have enough knowledge!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only you, this savage monster, will provoke a war for a stone!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when Roland thought that the other person would not answer this question, the nightmare opened his mouth, "I will tell you - then you will understand why today It is impossible to reverse the situation. As long as you taste the sweetness of inheritance, civilization will not forget the sweet taste, but will only be more eager for more. "It paused and looked at the witch around Roland. "You are the best example now - if you let humanity give up all the changes brought by the King of Greysburg, would you be willing?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the inheritance of the fragments is nothing but inheritance One of the ways, "the other party's words confirm Roland's long-standing speculation. "You pass on the new knowledge here to human beings, which is equivalent to human beings' inheritance of the dream world. But the effect of debris is more thorough and more comprehensive - it is not for the individual, but for the entire civilization. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Wakiris said the "fusion road" for more than a hundred years after the end of the first war of gods, that is a federation The battle of the end that you never knew.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should also know that the footprint of the third civilization has spread over most of the continent - if my family occupies the Blackrock Field, Human beings occupy the light and the second civilization occupies the heavens and the sea, then the third civilization is the master of the underground world. They are like cockroaches, their bodies are extremely fragile, and their use of magic is unique. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
