Carol smiled and blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't mean that..." She was a little embarrassed. "I thought that your ancient witch would never pay attention to these trivial things."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because there are mortals to take care of everything?" Carol leaned on the railing. "In fact, I used to be no different from those who are mortals."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia is a little surprised, "How come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although witches and mortals are essentially different, but united How can it put too much energy into the weak-powered witch? Unlike Felice, I have the lowest level of ability and magic after I wake up, and I can't help Taqila. So in the latter part of the war, I almost It was forgotten by the federation." She looked at the rolling river, as if she was staring at the past. "On that day when I lost my subsidy, I stayed with a group of mortals. After the city broke, I also relied on them to persist. At the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the morning Bucket, your performance is nothing like a non-combat witch ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; even if those ashes is extraordinary, I am afraid that is not her opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hundreds of years of training is enough to change everything," Carol spread his palms and slowly gripped. "Actually, compared to those companions, I am a god." The witch even has a bit of luck. It at least makes me stronger, no longer ignored by others, and has the ability to do something for everyone. It is more like a reward when I meet Roland."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia suddenly realized that the other person might not talk to her for no reason. "Why... tell me this?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carol looked up, "because of envy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stunned and looked at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your ability, even in the era of the Confederation, is a powerful fighting witch. So young, it has a high level of awakening, and Taqila’s superiors will also Have a seat for you." God punishes the witch with ease. "Do you know? At that time, my greatest desire was to join the sacred legion and get the blessings of Nataya before the expedition, and you can easily do this. Now that I have lost the possibility of further strengthening, you are still far from the limit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolton paused, "although the ability is stronger, The more challenges you encounter, the more frustrations you have to face – but don't forget that by the time you are in a bad situation, you are already enviable enough.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Andrea realized it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is enlightening themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of her father’s late apology, and after bidding farewell to her childhood playmates and embarking on her own return journey, she did have a special period of time until she left Her Royal Highness is getting closer and closer, and she gradually adjusts. It is obvious that the Wicked Witch has noticed this and will choose to share her past experiences with her at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this twist is nothing to the Tacitus survivors. As a witch, what she has is nothing compared to lost. It is true that there are many more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Andrea was silent for a moment, whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carol shook his head.
