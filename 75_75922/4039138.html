			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabella slightly lowered her head and waited for trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should thank you for your ability - not that it is strange enough, but that it can't kill others directly. No matter how much crime you commit, even if it is assistance Jielu attacked me, and you are just an accomplice.” Roland’s voice is clear and peaceful. “I can’t kill you, but you must redeem everything you do for yourself, just like other people who violate the law.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, after hearing this sentence, she felt something in her heart fell – she was not afraid of death, but she couldn’t talk about death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you can defeat the devil, I am willing to offer you everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil It is the enemy of all mankind, and of course I will fight them to the bottom of my heart - but unlike the way of the church, I will not win the battle of God at the cost of destroying human potential, and you have to change the habits of the church. Roland slowly said, "There will be no more pure people in the future. From today, you are a redemption witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only did he know the existence of the devil and the federation, but he was also ready to face the battle of God. It is true that he is a mortal, may die in a few decades, and his belief will collapse with aging, but now that you have endowed him with endless life, the last difficulty has passed, and the darling of the god is born here. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Isabella dragged her ankles and bent her knees, long hair spread over the ground, "obey, master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she got up again, Roland opened the door. "This is not the holy city of Hermes, so you are not a servant of mine, but a person of atonement. Of course I You won't be sent to the mine to dig a 20-year mine. What you have to do is to cooperate with Ai Gesha for magic research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, Just use it for him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the meantime, I will let Wendy arrange a new place for you. The time for redemption is five years, you can have no shackles, but only have limited" Freedom - In other words, in addition to the mage tower of the residence and Aisha, you want to go to other places, you must act under the surveillance of the Witch Alliance. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I understand. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, are you sure there are no other witches in the Holy City?" Roland asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question has been answered several times since she was captured. Isabella thought about it and finally shook her head, "for this In the decisive battle, Jielu turned all the useless new witches into gods, and the useful ones basically came to the battlefield. There are still a large number of women in the monastery, but before the evil month, their chances of turning into witches are not high. Vanilla, Maggie and I should be the only three people in the church. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't talk any more, turned and walked outside the house, and the blonde witch came forward to open her cockroaches.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella looked at his unbelievable hands to restore his freedom. Is this the final result of the trial? Without detention, playful or worse treatment, all the words he said were serious. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty," she suddenly stopped each other. "I don't know vanilla and Maggie. They are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s better than your situation," Roland said. "They are only affected by the twisted education of the monastery. They are still far away from the madness. If they can correct it, the two may have Join the Witch Alliance day. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slammed shut as the three left.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes... ... Isabella completely relaxed, she lay down on the wooden bed, feeling the sunlight shining outside the window, ignoring the light, squinting at the blue sky outside the iron railings.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a good weather, she thought.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your punishment is too light," returned to the office, and the night was dissatisfied. "She almost ordered your life." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
