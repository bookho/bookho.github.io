			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, Bianbu Town is still calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Iron Axe and Brian, the intensity and number of evil beasts will gradually increase as the month of the demon continues. Taking advantage of the current defensive pressure, Roland once again sent a dhow filled with ore to Liuye Town. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North Slope Mine, with the steaming of the first machine, the number of workers has dropped by half, while the output has steadily increased, and has now returned to the level before the landslide. Manpower has been greatly saved by the machine. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Roland made a preliminary reform of the mining production system, from the original fixed salary to the variable amount of compensation. He asked Barov to calculate the average daily output of the previous years, set as the standard, and each time he increased the production of a certain share, he would get a reward, and found that there are extra rewards for the gemstone veins. This measure has effectively promoted the enthusiasm of workers for production, and the entire mining area is in full swing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a surplus in his hand, Roland naturally wants to do something. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the steam No. 2 machine into the production plan, he also intends to manufacture a batch of manual machine tools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine tool has a long history. In general terms, it is essentially a tool table for processing appliances. So the anvil can be seen as the most original machine tool - hand-fixed, hand-built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handmade is better, but manual fixing is too inconvenient, so people put a buckle or groove on the table to fix the parts being processed. For example, the early hoist guns and the barrels of the flint guns were manually knocked out on the grooved anvil. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And later, the manpower tapping and milling can no longer meet the processing needs, the machine tool will be differentiated, according to different purposes, using different fixing methods and Processing tools, manual and mechanical linkage, effectively improve the shortcomings of pure manual force each time the strength is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland considers the manual milling machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the milling machine has a variety of functions, it is mainly for the processing of involute gears, so the structure can be simplified accordingly, only one pair is used for fixing The card slot of the toothed disc and a rotating steel disc can be used. The special shape grinding disc specially used for cutting gears can be easily manufactured with the help of Anna. The top of the grinding tool is polished into a ladder shape and then heated to a red state. The iron strip is used to pull out the impression on it, and then immersed in water for quenching treatment. A custom grinding disc with a high stiffness can be obtained. After the key problem was solved, Roland immediately recruited Carter to hire two carpenters to build the base of the milling machine for himself. Anna continued to manufacture other metal parts in the backyard of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that with Anna, metal processing has become as easy as pinching mud, especially after she is proficient in the retraction of the flame. Now the initial processing of small pieces is that she uses her hands to pinch out the general shape. Roland sighed when he saw the other party melting the iron ingot into a thick molten iron and then licking it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no witch, these plans in his mind may have to be delayed for more than a decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, the first simple milling machine appeared in the backyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Roland is not idle, painting gear can be regarded as his old line, he designed a gear set for speed control And stabilize the output of the steam engine. The corresponding toothed disc has been released, and the milling process can be carried out only after the milling machine is assembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gears are not new. Most of the world’s mines rely on livestock to pull wooden gears and winch mechanisms to drain water. This time the Cavaliers finally feel satisfied. I have traveled so much for the prince of the prince, so I can understand what the other party is going to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also asked him to bring three blacksmiths and their apprentices to learn about the use of milling machines in the yard. He can't operate these machines on a daily basis, so a group of professional workers must be trained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the people finished the ceremony, Roland began to demonstrate how to use the milling machine to machine the gears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't mind playing a senior fitter in front of everyone. In fact, there are all kinds of princes in this era, and there are many kinds of hobbies. In addition, there is a wind review that has not been adjusted before, and there is no pressure to operate the machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
