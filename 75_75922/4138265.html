			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And on the plane is the ... god punishment witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The banned magic field has the same effect as the god stone. The sorcerer witch should be able to drag and even kill the opponent. Even if it doesn't work, the sniper squad will have the opportunity to make up the last blow.” Northland Pearl said bluntly, “ Of course, this is not easy. How to do it depends on the other party's actions, but at least it is not helpless. I personally think that the success rate is not low - after all, the enemy has taught the bullets, but I have never seen the Seagull. If I don't see it, I also I can't believe that ordinary people can fly to the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland immediately understood the idea of ​​the staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that it’s not safe to expect a sniper squad. If the other party perceives from the inexplicable patrol beast, humans have a weapon that can strike at a distance and accurately. It is inevitable that some kind of response will be made - for example, to keep changing the flight all the way, or to reduce the high-level escape, then even Andrea has nothing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her ability to find the coin that must be erected, but the coin that must be erected does not necessarily exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, someone needs to stand up and fill that ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the speed of the demon, the chaser must have the strength to fight against the demon. In theory, there is no such candidate in the witch. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff had thought of the combination of a glider and a group of gods and witches to achieve the equivalent effect, has to be said to be a clever curve to save the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seagull can be hidden in the sky in advance, and then convert the altitude into speed when it needs to be blocked. As long as the kinetic energy accumulates over a period of time, the Seagull can easily break through. At a speed of 500 kilometers per hour, the devil who fled the first to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This plan should be the best solution that can be done now. But I don't think the ashes will agree - after all, it's ahead of the front line, and maybe even confronted with the demon." Roland looked at Tilly, "so..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will convince her." Tilly said after a moment of silence, "I am going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness!" Wendy Urgent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Roland can vaguely guess the mood of the head of the witch alliance. If there is any change in his own situation, Anna and Tilly can maintain the status of the witch. It is. One is the righteous queen, and the other is the heir to the jurisprudence. As long as they are there, they can firmly stabilize the forces of the parties. Therefore, Wendy does not want to see any accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you think about it, you know that what we do and how often we transport witches is not much different. Wait until the demon realizes the existence of the Seagull. At this time, Tajira’s sisters should have forced it to open, so the risks are within the controllable range.” Tilly smiled. “Reassure, I am not ashamed of the idiot, I will not do more than my ability. "Those things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows that the other party’s mind has been decided, and no longer intends to spend time on it, he looks to Isis, "You continue to say "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty." Itis went to the map. "The final step in the program is the ambush position. Without the support of the red fog, The high-level devil can't last long, so this potential thinking will drive the other side to retreat along the blood line to facilitate the replenishment of the gas tank as soon as possible. This also means that the best ambush location will be somewhere near the red line." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a good proposal about this." Said, "I don't know if you still remember that the extraordinary person had once sneaked into the enemy's back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...the idiot," Tilly Supporting the road, "I used to blame her for wasting a colorful magic stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But now, this is located behind the side of the Tajera ruins. The positioning point can give us an excellent viewing angle." El said to the Lord, "As long as the phantom instrument is deployed, the situation around the blood line will be in sight!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
