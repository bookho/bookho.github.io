			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark clouds in the sky have not dissipated, but the more they gather, the electric light sometimes breaks through the sky and makes a roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lightning and wheat stubble leave with the wounded witch, the ashes spurt a spurt of blood, sinking down, if not relying on the big sword Supporting the body, I am afraid it is quite difficult to stay still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last blow almost consumed all her magic - although the magic is still pouring into her body, but this process is completely out of her control, It is as if every meridian of the body is being burned by the flames. The sequelae of the exhausted power and the pain caused by the anti-phasic are superimposed and cannot be described in words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't know how long she can hold, but the only thing she can be sure is that she can't fall here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherth, everything that was done before will be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry thunder that fell from the sky undoubtedly hit the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half body of the flying magic stone is evaporated by the golden thunder. In addition to the restricted action, the strength should also be significantly reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Ash did not feel this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is still full of extremely dangerous atmosphere, and the perception of ascending to the extreme tells her that the enemy in front still has the ability to continue fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why she let the lightning person evacuate as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the magic of the scene is not caused by her alone. A large part of it also comes from the power of the demons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand up, you must hurry before the enemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash bite his teeth and slowly stood up and took the first step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the high-order devil who was scorched was struggling to climb slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, is it still alive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the previous shot, the ash aligned most of the power with the slayer, and did not expect that the power to make the mad ash annihilate could not make a The high-level devil is completely killed. If you know this, you can do it with a lightning strike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to her slight surprise, the high-level devil did not turn around and rushed to fight her, but dragged the broken body. Step by step to the front of the Usluk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...what is it doing, does it want to protect the demon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good, the ashes clenched the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, I will send both of you to hell at once! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of electro-optical penetration interference, Ursuk heard a cry It seems to come from the depths of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the moment, a wonderful connection has arisen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sees deeper things through the dazzling golden light - that is the field that it has been longing for, but has never been able to reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a glance, it crossed the threshold and left its mark. The boundary between this and the front is the essential gap between it and Maharaja. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the gap is gone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From sticking to Tajila to setting up humanity, it paid a lot of price and even violated the command of the Lord of the Sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it's all worth it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, you...promoted?" The latter immediately came with ecstasy, but it quickly dimmed. "Unfortunately, I will soon be at the source of magic, and I can't follow anymore... you are around." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I didn't advance. - To be precise, I am still the last step away from promotion. Just that blow of my mind has seriously hurt me, just because of the current situation. I can't do this on my own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What can I do for you?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian’s thoughts have once again become more uplifting. "Is this all right? Please give it to me." "Adults!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it can also try to cross the limits of the magic stone, directly blending itself with the source of magic, as the extraordinary witch did, What kind of consequences can be unpredictable. To be on the safe side, it doesn't mind being patient for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of communication at the level of consciousness is only in the blink of an eye. When the ascending body used up the last strength to climb up, the extraordinary person slowly stood up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... It’s no longer appropriate to call her superhuman now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than four hundred years, humans once again appeared above the extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the previous sense of consciousness is extremely expensive, and it is difficult to recover in a short time. This is also its best chance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first bodybuilder finally climbed to the front of Ersruk, this short distance has made its life smell as weak as the candle in the wind. But its consciousness is becoming more and more clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults...I can one day get rid of the cage of destiny, win the battle of God, and embark on the sky that has never been touched by anyone?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There will be a day, I promise." Erskuk paused and said its name, "Tatalos." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s eyes lit up, just like the brilliance that bloomed before the extinction, “So, please come with my soul--”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard stood up and slammed into his forehead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash couldn’t help but hold on, and then there was a huge sense of crisis in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw the high-level devil madly pulling out the magic stone on his head, and even with a large piece of flesh and blood, stuffed into the body of the demon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black light that wriggles at the wound swells in an instant! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly remembered what Roland had said - the devil needs to enhance the ability by integrating the magic stone, is it Ursruk intends to complete the promotion ceremony under such circumstances? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not, you must interrupt them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash slammed the pain of burning in the body, and once again put the magic that was hard to gather into the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thunder of the sky blasted her will, and when the power converges to the top, she slams the second sword after entering the new field! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the magic invested in it is not as good as the original one, but the momentum is not much worse, the golden thunder breaks through the clouds again, like a whip. The position where the devil stands - <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esruck makes a sharp scream, covering the black light of the body as a missing arm, and grabbing it directly to the electric light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two touched each other, suddenly triggered a violent explosion, and the whistling waves smashed a lot of sandstone, which separated the eyes of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dust fell slowly, the ashes gradually sank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
