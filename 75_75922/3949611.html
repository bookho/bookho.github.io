			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan Meade has been trapped in the basement of the Elk House Months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought he could stop Jacques, but he didn’t expect the other party to do it in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is today's lunch, please use it slowly," long-faced butler, Sean, handed a sticky meal to the cage and looked like a porridge. The mixture with the leaves is only the size of the palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me go out, you stupid!" Rennes flipped the plate to the ground and grabbed the railing and shouted. "Jacques is also an idiot, he I don’t know what I’m doing, but let me go out now!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeeper unsatisfiedly shook his head and pulled out the handkerchief to wipe the two dirty uppers. "If I were you, I wouldn't ruin the unfinished grain. The Earl of the Lord had told me that in order to save you some effort, I would only give one meal this Monday."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, you didn't hear what I was talking about?" Rehn yelled. "This is not a problem at all. If you don't stop Jacques, he will destroy the elk family. Look at my father's share, open this cage!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably the latter half of the sentence worked, the butler who was going to leave stopped Step by step, "Your father? I think if he is still alive, I am afraid I will drive you out of the house immediately." He turned his head and looked blankly. To Rennes, "Young Master, you seem to have forgotten to kill the Earl of Elk, the four princes Roland Wimbledon, and the honeysuckle family not only relies on the prince side, but also assists him to suppress the other four families. At this moment your brother is Fix this mistake, but you are scared to be invisible, so you can be treated as a knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a qualified knight You judge," Ryan said with anger. "In the past three years, when I was killed by the Hermes defense line and the evil beast, Jacques would only enjoy his glory in the king. You thought he was attacking the honeysuckle family because of courage. Don't laugh at the dead, he is only blinded by the interests!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn sighed, "Even if you are the younger brother of Jacques, you should keep the most Basic respect, after all, he is an earlord and the owner of the elk family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steward stopped paying attention to Rennes and quickly left the ladder. basement. When the gate closed, the ground returned to silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deer second son slammed on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the winter, Jacques has been visiting more and more families - he didn't care too much, after all, he has no interest in running the family. In addition, when Jacques refused to pay the ransom for the first time when he was captured by His Royal Highness the Prince, it was still that Pei Luo helped him to get out of the prison. The relationship between the two fell to the freezing point. Even so, Rennes did not intend to compete with the other party for the position of the homeowner. He heard the news that Bianyi Town planned to build the city. He even considered going to the town to loyalty to the Four Princes and officially became a guardian knight. But the situation changed. Later, at a private banquet held at the Lulu Mansion, he heard the news that the four families were preparing to jointly deal with the Long Song Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night, Ryan rushed into Jacques’s study and questioned the other person, but the latter blew out with great disappointment. After thinking about it overnight, he planned to tell Peero about this news, and then brought a patrol to stop Jacques. Unexpectedly, the other party actually moved his hands and feet at breakfast. When he woke up, he found himself trapped in a cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how Rennes growled and warned, he couldn’t see Jacques again. Every day, he can only judge the time through the skylight in the corner of the basement. The only person who can be contacted is Jacques's personal butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕噜..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long beep in his stomach, he was only I found myself hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the scattered food on the ground, Ryan overturned and leaned back on the heap of wheat behind him. Still sleeping... He thought, if he fell asleep, he would not feel hungry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just closed his eyes and the footsteps sounded again in the basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother, are you okay?" When the other party came to the cage, he discovered that the person was actually Orilyan, the three Miss of the Elk family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you come in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big brother is not there, those servants can't help me, "Aorelian looked at the porridge on the ground and couldn't set the channel. "They will give you this? It's too much! You wait for me, I let the kitchen do something for you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jacques is not in the house?" Hearing his sister's first half of the sentence, Ryan suddenly sinks his heart and can't even fill his stomach. "Where did he go?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know...he left two days ago," Orillian shook her head. "And took most of the guards at home, otherwise I also No chance to enter the basement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End, Ryan’s heart was cold, not returning for two days, plus today is the third day... even now that I can go out I am afraid it is too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother, I heard that Big Brother wants to be unfavorable to the honeysuckle family. Is it true?" Orilyan was worried. "Peo is not going to have anything to do." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes... Three sisters have always liked Peer. Hermon, and they also intend to match them, but the friend seems to have another heart. Have belonged. But now I don't think it's useless. Ryan sits softly on the railing and is weak. According to Jacques' style, he will not let go of the Hermon family. Then, the whole west will inevitably face The thunder of the prince is angry with the thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques stayed in the king for too long, he didn’t realize what he was going to face... Ryan closed his eyes and couldn’t help but recall The day of attacking Bianbu Town - the flame blooms in front of the eyes, the thunder is endless, the knight in front is like an invisible wall, the armor is vulnerable to the transparent arrows, the skills of many years of training, for the honor The courage of the war has lost its role in the face of the other's weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From that moment on, he will never have the idea of ​​being an enemy of His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can defeat the power of His Royal Highness - at least mortals can't. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Four Princes knew that the fortress had happened, and once again swept through, the elk family had more benefits, what is the use? This time... I am afraid he will not let go of the four big families again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother, what's wrong with you?" Orionan shook him, but he didn't mean anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deer family is finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, across the thick ceiling, Rennes heard a looming roar, then the ground shivered like something broke into it. The house is general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it wrong? Ryan turned over and saw her sister showing the same strange expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another dull thunder, but this time it was much clearer, and then the short ping-pong sound continued to sound, and the servant screamed in the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it... Is the army of the Four Princes coming? Rennes can't help but stunned. How is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened outside?" Orilyan stood up. "I went out to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No," Ryan grabbed his sister's hand. "Where you don't go, just wait!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诶?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to me..." He swallowed and said dryly, "Outside...may be dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roaring sound subsided in a short while, after about a quarter of an hour, a team of people broke into the basement - they wore uniform brown uniforms, holding strange long-handled weapons in their hands, and Ryan glanced at them. I recognized that the coming is the prince's troops! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was so desperate for a moment, knowing that His Highness would retaliate, but he did not expect to come so fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
