			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulz. When the fire was just near the family training ground, he heard the sound of the "squeaky" coming from inside - the movement was as big as a A heavy blunt instrument is used to repeatedly beat sandbags. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The patriarch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard at the door bowed down the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, is Loka practicing?" He pointed to the half-covered door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, she came early in the morning and said that nothing is going to bother her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will go see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the patriarch..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" Gulze glanced at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you please come in." The guards could not help but tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that his daughter is more and more majestic. He is not dissatisfied with the obstruction of the guards. Instead, he has raised his eyebrows with great interest. In this way, the mad flame clan will have a new successor when he can no longer board the burning fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the door, a training hall made up of thousands of cowhide, twine and wooden poles is in front of his eyes - can be built in the iron sand city In this indoor venue, there is no one who can do this except the one with the largest stone castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no dirt or stone brick in the hall, but a thin yellow sand. Walking on it is like walking in the desert. Although the gravel is small, it is not soft. There are many stomping things hidden inside. Most of them are the teeth or weapon debris left by the trainer. Of course, there are also a lot of blood infiltrated, so some of the yellow sand has a faint dark red color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gurz’s father’s father said that if all the yellow sands of this place can be reddish, the flames will always occupy the position of the clan’s head and There is no rival in the South. Therefore, he had considered that if the clan was defeated and had to leave the stone fort, not only the cowhide awnings, but also the yellow sand would be transported away. Even if you can't build another training ground, wait until you regain the first position and don't restart the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a row of iron hangers on the training hall. His daughter is naked with his feet, rolled up his trouser legs and sleeves, and slams his arms toward the hanging sandbags. A heavy punch. Gould has no doubt that if such a fist hits a person, it will definitely make the internal organs torn apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, when you see the performance of the Aosha clan, are you excited?" he smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia turned his body and swept the sandbags back to the swing with a whirlwind. The slender legs were as fast as lightning, and they flew out a bag full of people. - The hemp rope that was overwhelmed finally broke in a large swing. The sandbags rotated two times and slammed on the ground. The sand inside also sprinkled on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call..." She breathed a sigh of relief, and her beastual hands gradually returned to normal. "Don't say it, father, you know what I am thinking." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You fancy the goddess named Ash, right?" Gulze laughed twice. "After all, fighting alone, the entire iron sand." It’s hard for the city to find an opponent that can match you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia’s mouth whispered, “Unfortunately they just won the qualification of the iron sand city, they should be For a long time, it will not be used, even if they give them a test invitation, Aosa estimates that they will not agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, as a new promotion The clan, there are still a lot of trivial things to deal with in Tiesha City. I am afraid that next spring, they will usher in new challengers, and no one will waste any effort at this time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I can only find sandbags to chat," Luo Jia sighed. "Are you looking for me to say this?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you rather chat with sandbags than talk to your father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...this is not," she trembled with her ears on her head, falling down like a mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
