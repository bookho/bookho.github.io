			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test location is at the foot of the town’s west wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Roland, the spectators also have all members of Iron Ax, Tigu, Brian, and the Witch Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plus a fat pigeon on the watchtower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid bullet accidental injury, everyone must be on the wall and watch the two men - the chief knight Carter Lannis and the extraordinary witch ashes will be away In the nearer range of the city wall, a one-on-one contest is launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter's attire is not a knight's armor, but a casual leather case that is easy to move. The waist is a special custom holster band, on the left and right sides. Insert a revolver. A short knife is placed across the back waist position and can be used temporarily for emergency. But Roland knows that if you want to use the short knife and the supernatural to fight, it is better to directly admit defeat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ember is still the usual dress, a black robe covers her body, black long hair tied into a ponytail, naturally falling behind, seems to completely ignore this will give Make yourself redundant weaknesses. The only difference is that the big sword, the wrapped cloth has been uncovered, and the dark brown sword has almost no light. As Roland expected, the surface of the sword was uneven, not like a well-built weapon, and due to lack of maintenance, rust spots had appeared in the area where the cut was made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked into the venue, and Carter constantly adjusted his position until he was more than fifteen meters away. He had more than 80% of the fixed target at this distance. He took out two pistols and he finally checked the bullets and slammed the fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland lets the echo imitate and amplify his voice. "The rules of the test are simple: until the point is up, you are not allowed to start, you can admit defeat! As long as it is not on the spot, Na Nava’s healing ability can quickly restore you to the original. Is there any problem?” He waited a moment and saw that the two had no objections and then said, “After hearing the bell, the test begins!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash silently looked at the opponent. As an extraordinary person, she mostly listened to her own instinct and fought. After following Tilly, she also learned the battle from the sword master in the court. Skills, but she always feels that these techniques are of little help to me. The other is the chief knight around the prince, but he does not carry the common sword shield or spear, and even the armor is not worn. The weapon in the hand is extremely weird, but according to the shape, it is obviously not a kind of close-up weapon like a dagger. Then there is only one possibility. It should be similar to the handcuffs. It is a long-range strike weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bow is not a threat to the supernatural, this is the experience that Ashes summed up in many battles. If it is contempt, she can even catch the fly with empty hands. Come to the company. But looking at the prince's vowed, the weapon in the other hand will never be as simple as a bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her instinct tells her that she must be close to the Cavaliers as soon as possible, instead of waiting for the other side to attack first. Therefore, before the start of the test, the ashes inserted the front section of the sword into the ground. This posture seems to be no threat, but it is the most effective means to deal with the bow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a clear bell sounded from the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash almost started at the same time, she grasped the hilt with both hands, slammed forward, and the soil, grass roots and gravel vacated with the wide sword From the beginning, splashing in the direction of the knight, formed a silt smoke screen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief knight’s reaction was also very quick. The weapon in his hand burst into a flame and made a huge roar, but the ashes did not see anything – either It is the other side that does not have an arrow, or the arrow is almost too fast to detect. She is more inclined to the latter than the first almost stupid mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of the sediment, the ash sprinted from the side, and the distance between the two was almost halfway in the blink of an eye, and at this time the sediment The smoke screen has not yet fully landed. The average person will subconsciously avoid the overwhelming mud, and she will win most of the time as long as she can interrupt the other party to continue shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Carter didn’t move his position, completely ignoring the sand on his face, squinting his eyes at the approaching superb, and pulling the trigger again. - The roaring sounds with the fire, and the ash is stepping out to the outside with a conditioned condition. The arrow that has been thrown out is still not seen, and the knight has not prepared the arrow and the like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new type of weapon can be launched continuously, but in the case of two consecutive shots, the outcome is already divided! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
