			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The expression is so serious," the nightingale suddenly laughed. "In fact, no matter what you say, I will believe it. But you have to give others a little time." Accept it, or else you can say that if you slap a big thing, you can turn thousands of demons into fly ash. No one can imagine it immediately, especially after seeing Lucia's separated objects."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there?" Roland touched his cheek, presumably considering that human beings faced a life-and-death time competition, which made him unconsciously feel a sense of crisis, "but you said Also, after all, I didn’t even believe myself before I saw it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and put the unremarkable stone The piece is pinched in the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the beginning of the road to fire - purified metal uranium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really hard to associate it with the “things of glory” by a few words, the silvery white surface becomes dim due to oxidation. Nothing, the cold touch feels nothing to do with light and heat, but Roland knows that as long as it is under the right conditions, nature will show its magical scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To collect it, after the meeting, Lucia and Speer were busy on the North Slope mine for a week, breaking the granite around the mine. Decomposed all over. For this reason, the Countess also complained that it was a serious injury to turn her up and down in the rock pile. For this reason, she also took five apprentices from the City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is such a small piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thumb-sized metal uranium has a purity of more than 90% compared to the uranium block originally used as a sample, and is divided into two layers under the adjustment of Lucia. The surface is uranium-235, the rest is uranium-238, and the composition ratio is 1:99, which is also the natural proportion of the two in nature. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the surface of the stone sheet is less than a uranium element of the thickness of the hair, which can be called "weapon-grade". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a stable nuclides, whether it is the vast majority, but not useful 238, or the 235 that can be used to make the ultimate weapon, its half-life is ten Billion years. Such a long decay period, together with the release of alpha particles in the decay, is only a few tens of micrometers in human tissue, and even the epidermis can not penetrate, so even if it is held in the hand, it will not be fatally outside. Photo damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this does not mean that it is absolutely safe to directly touch high concentrations of uranium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, some of the alpha-nuclides produced by decay may be highly toxic, and sticking to your hands and eating into your stomach is troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Roland asked Soroya to put a transparent film on the "stone tablets", in addition to preventing further oxidation, but also to avoid chemical poisoning accidents. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that most people in this world have not developed the habit of washing their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the things in his palm, and his heart was a little emotional. This piece of metal uranium, which contains enormous energy, is so quietly lying in the palm of the hand. Before it reaches the critical point, it looks so peaceful and harmless. It is almost no different from the iron. It is no wonder that Pasha will be unbelievable. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that this step has been taken, the first priority is to collect all the raw materials needed for radiation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achima can find a sample with a much higher purity through high-concentration uranium coins, at least it is feasible to use it for prospecting. Although Lucia decomposes and aggregates in the mine day after day, it can get a sufficient amount of uranium-235, but that is contrary to the original intention of multi-project parallelism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of high-end metal smelting, she still has an irreplaceable role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding that weapon-grade uranium alone cannot make a real live ammunition - if you want it to not become a dirty bomb, Roland needs a A really rare element. It is usually associated with uranium ore and is only one-tenth of a millionth of the former. Even with the help of Lucia, a large amount of raw ore is needed to solve it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, you have to look at Ajima. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
