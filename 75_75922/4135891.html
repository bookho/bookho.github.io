			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the lab was designed by him, but when he witnessed it, Roland’s heart still rose a bit of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this underground where the hand should not be seen, the glowing magic stone reflects the road ahead, and the surrounding stone walls are covered by a piece of two-meter square lead plates. Formed a regular space of basketball court size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equal and smooth lead baffles, staggered straight gaps, cold light spilled on them, seemingly lifeless. But it is such a room, but it has an invisible beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the beauty of the industrial age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we fail to win the battle of God, after hundreds of years, should it be an ancient relic?" Roland whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is a ruin of a different style, not the same as the underground civilization and the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fine scratch marks on the lead plate are the marks of human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe." Pasha gently put the two down. "But I have never believed it like this. I believe that human beings will come to the end." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too." Roland smiled and walked into the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire room is divided into two areas, the operating area and the observation area - both separated by a concrete wall nearly half a meter thick, and also externally attached stereotype. The glass placed in the center of the wall is made of Lucia. The lead oxide is added to the conventional ingredients. Due to the technical level, the transmittance of lead glass is not as bright as that of the later generations, but at least it can be seen clearly. Case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You come, kneel down." A master must extend from the door of the operating area, followed by the huge body of Seren, and his appearance is quite a few The momentum of the horror film, but the bolts and rulers that she had to roll up quickly weakened the feeling. "I heard Pasha’s notice when I installed the last lead. Zoe they have already Is the relic brought back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s in this box." Roland put the lead box on her main whisker, then walked into the operating area and checked it carefully. Some time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? This is exactly what you want," Catherine raised the tentacles. "But is it really necessary to do this? If the curse is only A kind of light, ordinary wall is enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In case of just in case. If it is as I thought, the light it emits Not only will it not be seen by the naked eye, but also has a strong penetrating power. Ordinary walls can really block, but it must be at least a few meters thick." He turned back to look at the two ancient witches, "so ten million Don't act with intuition—even if the original carrier had a high level of resilience, it must be tested in accordance with the charter before it is thoroughly understood.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Because ionizing radiation destroys the DNA structure of cells, resulting in replication disorders, it is the most harmful to tissues with fast metabolism. Organs like the heart and brain, which do not change once they mature, are much more resistant to ionizing radiation. From the perspective of the original carrier's life span of hundreds of years, the aging cycle is surprisingly long. In theory, it should also have certain immunity to radiation. This is why Roland has given the test to Catherine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin laughed. "You look like you, the president of the Detective Society. Rest assured, the rigorous code has always been pursued by the Quest." The guidelines, I will not care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded, "So let's get started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The isolation door was closed, and only one of the Saline was left in the operation area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first article of the test charter, the study of the Rubik's Cube must be closed inside and outside the laboratory, except for the operator, others can only wait in the observation area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lead glass, Roland saw that Celine opened the box and took out the Rubik's Cube inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Shawn said, a shallow blue light flows along the crack in the stone, pointing to the coin placed on the test bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
