			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are three more days," the nightingale suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, there are still three days." Roland nodded. At the current marching speed, the first army could reach the pre-determined offensive position three days later - There is a raised hillside, the slope just facing the outpost, not only the open view, but also very suitable for setting up fortifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they are allowed to stand firm, it’s hard for the devil to move the gun line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the next few days, the pressure on the sniper squad will also increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The premise that they are silent is that God does not know, ghostly and unconsciously cut off the enemy’s perception, on the vast plains, if not transmitted in real time. The ability to message, it is almost impossible to accurately grasp the location of the attacker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the increase in patrols, the devil has the possibility to exchange real-time news with a quantitative advantage - just witness the moment when the loser is shot down The search circle will be greatly reduced, and they want to take another shot and become a risky thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best result is that the enemy noticed the existence of the sniper squad and could not lock the specific position, while the latter closed his hand in time and turned around to join the first army. This can not only involve the devil's flying troops, but also get enough time for the main force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that they all need to judge for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early or late will make this attack full of variables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should believe them," the nightingale seemed to see Roland’s fears. "The Taqila witch’s judgment of risk should not be worse. The Magic Ark can avoid most of the pursuits. Even if you encounter the squad devil, it is not easy to get rid of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roland patted his cheek, and in the end there was no shortage of strength in the winter city, so that he needed to take this risk. The speed of walking severely restricts the limits of the First Army. If it can be equipped with wheeled vehicles, it is possible to launch a slamming battle on the Great Plains. Even if the army is going down at the bottom of the eye of the beast, the enemy is too late. prevent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond meaningless fears, he should pay more attention to the work at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Wendy should have mastered the basic principles of flight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Probably," Nightingale smiled and threw a piece of dried fish in his mouth. "Last night she fell asleep and still said a dream, saying that the runway was empty and the green light was fully open."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good," Roland looked out of the window. "The weather seems to be pretty good today. It seems that the next step can be tested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh? Are you going to officially test the real thing of that thing..." The night glowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, are you interested in it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nobody will not be interested She exclaimed, "Without the wings, you can fly to the sky. It is more free than a hot air balloon. Anyone can control it. It sounds almost the same as a miracle. If it succeeds, you know what the people will do." Look at you? I am afraid that the gods will not be able to shake your prestige."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When these words are said, the look of the nightingale is even brighter than the chaotic drink. It is as if the person who won the admiration is her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but laugh. "Now it’s just at the stage of exploration. There is still a long way to go to achieve the step you said. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least the steam engine can't meet its needs, he needs a more powerful source of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it will eventually be realized, right?" The nightingale walked back to the door and smiled back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Roland did not hesitate to answer, "It will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One kilometer east of the shoal harbor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beachhead that is out of the water sinks into the sea here, leaving only a section of stone ridge that extends continuously to the southeast, and it is this long rocky ridge that constitutes The outline of the southern part of the entire Grey Fort Kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the inland people living in the West, the border is just a part of the hilly landform. When you climb the gently rising slope, you can see the wide and boundless The whirlpool; but for the sea traders, this is an insurmountable barrier. The average height difference between the sea and the stone is more than 15 meters. Not to mention the inability to load and unload the goods, it is dangerous to approach the dock. Therefore, before the shoal was opened, one third of the borders of the West clearly bound the sea, but there was no port of the sea. It can be said that the overall economic level of the western part of the Kingdom is not as good as that of the eastern and southern regions. The most important reason is the lack of the harbour, in addition to the damage caused by the evil moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such terrain is now an excellent test flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland and his entourage arrived here, the defending troops stationed in the Winterless City had sealed the surrounding area one kilometer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the concrete-cast runway, three identical test prototypes were being pushed onto the lift by soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Is this what you call a new machine?" Thunder sighed and sighed. "It’s true that the shape is reminiscent of seabirds. But compared to those steam engines that are endless... it seems a bit thin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most reliable overseas ally, the fjord outstanding explorer Thunder, and the female Merchant Margaret is naturally invited to observe Roland. For the evaluation of the former, Roland was not surprised. After making a mysterious smile, he looked at Margaret. "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Back," the latter said calmly. "To be honest, it is too different from your previous creation. If it wasn’t for your personal invitation, I would have thought it would be a strange thing to lie in your scorpion. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Wonder Club?" Roland asked curiously. "What organization is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "A group of guilds between the craftsmen and the explorers," Margaret explained. "They are not willing to be flattered by craftsmen, but they dare not join the sea of ​​anger, so they Focusing on a variety of quirky inventions. Two years ago, someone made something similar—a pair of wood wings that were passed on to let the wearer fly.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wood...wings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's somewhat similar to yours, but it's small Multi almost one aspect "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" that he flew up yet, "Wendy side not help but ask?. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Margaret shook his head. "He put his wings on, jumped from a tower, and his wings quickly turned over like stones." When he fell, he fell to the ground and died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wendy couldn't help but swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And before that person claimed that he had succeeded several times, it also caught the attention of several big chambers of commerce. So this scam not only made him It became a joke, and it made the reputation of the strange things worse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland heard a sigh of emotion here, Wood to make wings, obviously realized that the greatest possible lift is the key to flight, and only with a hard frame can support enough area of ​​force - to this step, basically get rid of the simple imitation of the bird, The prototype of the fixed wing was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the other party is considered to be a pioneer in the exploration of the sky, at least compared to the historical brains that have appeared in artificial wings, umbrellas, and cloak flights. Too much progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Successful times is not a nonsense, but a close-range gliding experiment at a low altitude, but the wind is much higher at high altitudes, plus The lack of control surface on the upper wing, and the instantaneous loss of control is also expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the fjord advocates explorers who can bring living space to the islanders. It is difficult for people who dare not go out to sea to get a fair evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
