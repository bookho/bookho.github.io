			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These people are all witches, Tassa does not lie, the ashes can feel the magic in their bodies, and they can roughly distinguish the strengths and weaknesses - in front of them This is especially true for the leader. Her magic is like a sharp knife. It is a tingling sensation if she concentrates on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My name is Ash, I am very glad to meet you, the sisters of the Aid." She put the giant sword aside and went up to the four witches. Hug... No, she thought, it should be five. The ashes looked up and stared at the black spots hovering in the sky. "Can she not come down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She shows us the way," the leader laughed. "I It was a nightingale," she then pointed to the other three witches, "book rolls, leaves, and echoes." Finally, in the mouth of Nunu, "The little girl is lightning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When the ashes looked at the book, they felt awkward, and the magical feelings in the other side were very weak. It was like a cloud that spread all over the body. This feeling surprised her. "Superman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the nightingale is also somewhat unexpected. "Can you see the magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not seen, it is felt," Ashes explained "The extraordinary person can detect the shape and flow of the magic. This is because all parts of the body have been transformed by it. I think this sister must have the same feelings as me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The book smiled and nodded: "Indeed, it made me find a lot of companions in the vast sea of ​​people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "Is it super rare?" asked the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party’s first concern is the quantity, not the “extraordinary person”... The ambiguous thoughts, did the Aid have heard of the existence of the extraordinary witch? This is the secret of the church's severe ban, because the power of the extraordinary witch directly acts on itself, not subject to the stone of God's punishment, and any one who is exposed is the first enemy of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "About thousands of witches, there will be an extraordinary person," thought so, her face still as usual, "So far, The compatriots I have seen, plus the books, there are only three people." The ashes paused for a moment. "Right, I remember that the leader of the co-help club seems to be called Hakala. Is she okay?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is dead," the nightingale shook her head, "dead on the way to the holy mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...is really a Regrettable news, "The ashes kept the voice down, but what made her care was that the other side did not show much sadness when talking about this issue. "Who is your new leader now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will go back to the town and talk slowly," she smiled. "You will see him soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the town, the ashes found something wrong. The couples who helped the witches held the torches and walked on the streets with great brilliance. And even after the night, the town is not dead, many households' paper windows reveal a faint fire, listen carefully, and the children's bursts of reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as a candle, but the savings of civilians are limited and will not be easy to use when not necessary. In the town, there are so many households who lit candles at night. It is an incredible sight, plus a word-by-word reading. Are they teaching children to learn to read words? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the other party does not mention, she is too lazy to ask. Anyway, this is not a place to live for a long time. What she has to do is to take everyone away as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the criss-crossing streets, the pedestrians are getting closer and closer to the castle area, and the ashes can see the dark walls and the guards standing guard at night. "Where are we going?" She couldn't help but speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bianzi Town Castle, it’s almost here." The answer is her nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait," she couldn’t help but slow down. "That is where the Lord lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Well, it's also the home of the witches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you reaching an agreement with the lord?" The ash frowned. Even if the Communist Party is stronger in the local powers, it is difficult to compete with the lords and churches who have the stone of the gods. Therefore, the only possibility is cooperation - this is one of the survival ways for some witches to explore. Unfortunately, in the face of the weak witch group, most of the lords are not willing to sit down and talk about conditions fairly, but endlessly squeeze and demand, so this road is quickly blocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
