			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha..." Heather laughed out. "It’s not possible to expect the chess piece to be completely obedient. It’s the same as our ultimate goal. No matter where he is playing, as long as he constantly consumes the soldiers. Anyway, the Grey Fort is the last kingdom of the plan, and there is still time for them to kill. Last time Roland Wimbledon did not reject our pills? Tefko gave more pressure to the West, and he might accept it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, the open face of the Queen of Water still makes Meien somewhat unhappy. After all, this piece was chosen by him personally. If Tefko still does not fight with Garcia after occupying other sites in the Grey Fort, but the squadron keeps confrontation, the squad will not achieve the desired results. It seems that there are some other means that must be taken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The West Side is still waiting for the news of the ambassador to come back and make a decision," he said. "Come here today, the two adults are acting according to plan." I have to go to the Hermes office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, yes," Heather seemed to realize that "Today is the day of transformation." How many more people apply to participate in the conversion ceremony?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the secret of the institution." Mayn stood up and walked out of the Chamber without looking back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long dangling ladder down to the bottom of the hole, the Archbishop crossed the mirror Smooth white grindstone, walking towards the depths of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different from the usual quietness, today’s organs are quite lively, and a group of judges who have passed the review are waiting outside the agency, most of them are entering for the first time. This place is looking around curiously. Seeing Mayn, everyone is straight and chest, clenching a fist, "Bishop adult!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and nodded. These judges are all elite warriors of the church. They are sincere and willing to sacrifice to the gods. The transformation of the gods is not a successful ritual. They understand this before submitting their applications. Even so, they are still willing to do this. Give your life with honor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the reverence of the samurai, he passed through the third level and came to the front of the secluded area. The pope's bodyguard has been waiting here. They bowed and then pushed the metal door behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean followed the guard into the door. From here on, it is the heart of the Hermes institution, and all the research and development of the church is carried out here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no torch in the secret area, his vision suddenly turned black, and after a little adaptation, a narrow passage appeared in front of him. The walls and ceiling of the passage are made of iron, and both sides are inlaid with fluorescent stones. This strange stone is a kind of stone of the gods. After being contaminated with blood of the evil beast, it can emit green fluorescence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a cage at the end of the passage. Walking into the cage, the guards pulled down the organ, and the sound of the chains on the top of the head made a loud noise in the silent passage. Accompanied by this sound, the cage slowly sinked into the hollow of the ground, and then Mein suddenly opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extremely empty underground space is in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how many times you look at it, it will make him feel small and small. According to common sense, the cave buried in the ground should be dark and stretched out. - The huge stone of divine punishment is like a prism with numerous roots rising from the ground, forming a cluster of crystal flowers. The smallest prisms also have body thickness. The big ones can be surrounded by more than ten people, and the height is uneven. The highest one is almost straight to the top of the cave, which is higher than the tower of the Temple of Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are also different in color. The most dense cluster of sacred stones is lavender, and the clusters on the sides change from dark blue to light green. The small ones are white, and some of the prisms that have just emerged from the ground are almost transparent. The brilliance of the purple god's stone is the most conspicuous, especially the root of the tower of the sky, the brightness is close to the full moon, so that the bottom of the hole can be faintly seen without the help of a torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the influence of such a large and powerful stone of punishment, the interior of the mountain is in a region where magic cannot be effective. The stone of the gods sold by the church is also extracted from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
