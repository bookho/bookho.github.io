			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the castle, Roland is still awkward. As the saying goes, I am very happy to cry, but from the cry of the hero, he does not feel all joy, just like the past suppressed too many grievances, pains and grievances, and finally got a vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the strength she showed was not to regard pain as nothing, but to put all those negative emotions in my heart. However, this is also a normal reaction of a person. Before the dramatic change, the hero is just a young girl. It is not destroyed by these tortures. It is still hopeful. It is very rare to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment results are very successful, and her restored feet are basically the same as ordinary people. Although it is difficult to bend a toe because it has not been worn for too long, since it can feel this part of the limb, it means that the nerve has been connected to the spine, and then after restorative training, it will be heavy sooner or later. The ability to be free to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This treatment also allowed Roland to further determine the ability to break the sword, which is to raise the witch's "tipping point." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of each witch has its limits, such as hummingbirds - there are limits to the weight, duration, and weight loss of weight-loss objects, even if one condition Exceeding, the magic required will also grow at a rapid rate, just like the index of beating, but beyond too many results can not be achieved. For example, she can't make a mountain as light as a feather, and there is no way to keep the weight loss effect forever. The reason may be that the magic cost of doing so is probably an astronomical number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa is also the same, the re-emergence of the broken limb is likely to far exceed the critical point of its ability, so it is clear that the finger can be restored, but there is no way to recover The limbs can't be done even with the help of leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break the sword is equivalent to expanding this limit, so that things that could not be done before can be turned into a barely achievable thing; The way of display becomes the ability to perform multiple times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled a stack of reports from the drawer and spread it at the table—that is, Wendy’s test record of the combination of the broken sword and the rest of the witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that most of the witch’s abilities have been significantly strengthened, and the index growth is amazing, but the reversal is equally expensive. For example, the dawn of the mysterious moon enchantment, the duration of the extension from five days to half a month, before the winter city does not have large-scale power generation capacity, this upgrade is very precious. After all, the more factories are built, the lighting power has gradually become the bottleneck of production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a state of candlelight curing that lasts longer under the increase of the broken sword, which is good for the service life and processing level of the machine. Without her ability, and with so many newcomers being crammed into the factory, it is not surprising that one or more of the sickles or two or three machines were scrapped a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, Soloya, Ai Gesha, Lucia, white paper, etc., are active in the production line, and the witches are the beneficiaries of the broken sword. . The industrial level of No Winter City climbed too fast, and many supporting systems and manpower were not in place. It was completely based on the witches that there was no collapse. Otherwise, according to such a crude and simple production method, two days of work stoppage, three days and one explosion estimate is not counted. What news. Now that there is a broken sword, this part is more stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland wrote his own inference at the end of the report, and it is foreseeable that Broken Sword will become one of the busiest witches in the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the afternoon, the guardian Sean walked into his office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Your Majesty, Minister of Chemical Industry, Mr. Kamo, wants you to go to a nickname lab. He said that the things you have explained have already got a clue."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Roland’s eyes lit up. "You arrange the trip, I will leave immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes , Your Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a team of guards, Roland came to the No. 4 lab. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of the acid plant and the nitrification plant, the simple workshop with the nature of small workshops and even the test belt production has become a real study without winter city. place. These buildings, located next to the Chishui River, were not only separated by walls, but also equipped with guards and logistics. Even the houses were re-decorated, and the exterior walls were painted white and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
