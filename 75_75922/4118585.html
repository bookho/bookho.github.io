			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people present have witnessed this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw that the glider type has not left the track, it has planted the stone ridge and disappeared under the horizon - the whole process changes quickly, even It’s too late to make a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland even squeezed a sweat for the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that there will be various accidents during the flight test, so he has prepared a number of prototypes and plans to use the amount to change the experience, but did not expect the first time. The crash will come so early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, the glider is slow, the operation is simple and clear, the load is low, as long as a little wind can fly for a long time, it is very friendly for the novice. . The points that are easy to cause loss of control are just two or three. Roland has repeatedly emphasized the principle when it comes to the principle, and Wendy obviously pulls the nose too high, causing the speed of the aircraft itself to be quickly exhausted and thus lost. Lift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even this step is not an irreparable dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Wendy can artificially create lift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, as long as she releases the wind to the tail and reduces the wind that is holding the body, she can change the elevation angle to the depression angle and regain the speed of advancement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the strong wind suddenly applied to the main wing caused the whole plane to turn over. So far, only the abandoned machine can go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that the glider can’t fall over, but considering the safety of the two, the seat welded on the plane has no design like seat belts, except The armrests on both sides are used to fix the occupants, which is an aluminum shelf with a seat backrest, and no other binding force. Therefore, once the plane is turned over, the occupant's posture can be imagined...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Tilly did not worry everyone for too long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few seconds, she appeared on the edge of the rock with Wendy's arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not hurt?" Roland asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, nothing happened," Tilly smiled and gasped. "In order to avoid being caught by the big guy above my head, I will fly down first." After a while, I climbed up after I escaped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability of Flying Magic Stone is not as lightning-proof, it has extremely demanding requirements for weight bearing, even with When two people fly, there will be no obvious delay, but the consumption of magic will increase greatly, and it will be difficult to control. Although the five kings said it was easy, Roland knew that if it was not her outstanding control ability, the rescue would not be so simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry... Your Majesty," Wendy looked a little frustrated. "What you are not easy to make, I am..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not your fault. No one knows the flight when they are born - it is not in our field." Roland quickly comforted, "and compared to making it, it The materials used are heavy, and these can be recycled afterwards without causing much damage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, is it..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can assure you that all these words are true," the nightingale suddenly showed up and made a face to his friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter was relieved, "I understand... I will try again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Roland is a little bit sorrowful, this is an alternative use of the ability to lie. In addition, he always felt that since she was the head of the Witch Alliance, she was not too hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t you take a break?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's okay, but remember - safety is first and foremost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is handed over to me. "Tilly smiled slightly, "Brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it turns out that flying is not something that is so easy to master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second test flight lasted only three minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Wendy made great progress and smoothly made the glider type rise from the horizon to a height of nearly 50 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the wing was over-rolled during the steering. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it can be seen that Wendy has tried to adjust the wind direction and wants to rebalance the aircraft, it can swing a few times and eventually end in failure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tili decisively pulled her away from the seat in advance, and the glider fell to the ground with a twist, and the two wings appeared to be deformed to varying degrees, apparently in repair I can't continue to take off before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene has allowed all participants to remember the history of the first flight in human history, only three meters from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not enough to fly. Roland needs to turn it into practical equipment as quickly as possible to cope with the increasingly close battle of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a drop efficiency, he will soon be able to achieve the achievement "What kind of experience is it to drop three planes in one morning?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the problem this time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a crosswind," Tilly shrugged Dao, "The speed at that time was also somewhat inadequate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty nodded in blame, "I didn't control it, and I was confused about the magic." If you only pay attention to the operation on your hand, you should not fall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that Roland’s heart is a question that he had previously ignored. The ability of the witch to exercise is to concentrate. When in a panicked environment, the ability is not as stable as usual. Once the ability is not precisely controlled, it will not only help the aircraft, but will be counterproductive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to overcome this, it seems that only more practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or - let me try it," Tilly said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You?" He gave a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have also been on the flight principle class. If I come to operate, at least I don't have to distract myself to control the wind, so Wendy's burden will be reduced. And..." Tilly raised her lips and her eyes flashed with eagerness to try. "I think I can control this big guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Wendy Opinion, Roland thought for a moment and agreed to her initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the reason for choosing the former to test flight is mainly to consider that the operator can best know the changes and demands of the wind, the glider can always be in a continuous flight state. But now it seems that it is not as easy as he imagined to achieve the effect of fan integration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, it would be fine to adjust the plan slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly is his nominal sister and the leader of the sleeping spell, making her happy is undoubtedly one of her responsibilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, there is only one prototype that can be tossed by them. When the toy falls, it is not bad, that is, some spare parts are made before the next test flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the third glider left the track, Roland found himself underestimating the other Ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, it was only a smooth flight to the Haiping line, and steadily increased the height, but when the plane turned back to the sun, its rhythm gradually became different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw it rise by the wind, like a flexible petrel, walking between the blue sky and the sea - although using swallows to describe a clumsy The biplane is somewhat inappropriate, but under the control of Tilly, both turning and pitching are extremely natural. In such a smart flight, Roland feels a sense of harmony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
