			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the current situation?" Tilly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy blocking the team was almost completely stunned, and the devil who remained in the sky was also fleeing backwards. It should be that we won." Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to show up at the end," Andrea said with a shrug. "It seems that the last devil was injured." It’s not light.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seagull was not involved in the battle, but was always hovering in the clouds, preventing the possibility of Heckzod or Other high-level devils. After all, the most effective means of dealing with these dissidents is still Andrea's close sniper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike Yixing’s partner, Hilli’s heart was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that the counterattack and the last ambush against the Scorpio Lord are not the same thing. The enemy has never been aware of the existence of the Seagull. Because she was not on the plane at the time. The changes in the situation on the battlefield are conveyed by listening to the seals. Even if she has been exposed to the eyes of the vigilant eyes, the Seagull has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time because of the need to stay away from the camp, she must follow the Seagull action in order to play a commanding role. It is for this reason that if the Lord of Scorpio appears with a new vigilant eye, the Seagull will be discovered by the other party. In other words, Andrea's attack can only achieve its unintended effect when Hecksod or other high-level devils appear alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, in the case of a missed strike, it will be difficult to predict what will happen in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they don’t appear to be a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, there is nothing better than a successful completion of the task, and everyone is safe to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still don't want to shoot, if Hecksod really comes, I don't think the team can still retreat." Tilly shook her head helplessly. "I guess when Itis made this plan, it was probably gambling that the alert eyes that could move freely were not immediately lost when they were lost, so the Scorpio Lord would not dare to appear."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement almost tells the voice of Hilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but nod and nod, it’s the Royal Princess! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right..." Tilly drove the glider to drill out the clouds. "Since the victory has been fixed, then confirm the results before the evacuation."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver is also experienced in this kind of thing - without the barrier of obstacles, she can complete the rough battlefield with very little magic Examine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, at the moment of conclusion, she could not help but hold it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two thousand... No, close to three thousand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three thousand? Wendy was surprised. "How can there be so much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those madmen--" Hillvi took a deep breath and looked at the hillside. "They didn't come to the team before, but fled in the air!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, she noticed the dense hole on the top of the mountain - Obviously, in order to reduce the fog consumption, most of the enemies are drilled into the ground, and they will only be awakened when they need to fight. But when the fortress is broken, the red mist that has not been supplied to the source will quickly dissipate, and these devils will smash the disaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their swarming out is not to destroy the attackers, but to detect the dissipating of the fog, instinctively driven to hide the hiding place, rushing toward the mountain, I hope to rush to the next red fog supply before the breath is cut off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whether it is the fine sand city or the sinking bay, it is a little too far away from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red atomized world has become clean and clear again, but for the devil, it is a dead place that cannot survive. They did not run far and they fell to the ground, and evenly spread a circle under the foot of the hillside. Except for a few madmen with gas cans, most of them are silent at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
