			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is a more advanced bullet processing line. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland's design line can be counted as a water-flowing process, but in the eyes of military experts, it is simply not worth mentioning, bluntly calling it the level of the workshop. In the original words of the other party, this kind of product with relatively simple structure and process can completely replace more than 95% of the manpower work with machines, and rely on mechanical control equipment to basically achieve 24 hours without interruption. produce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the military industry program, the new production line has invested a lot in the early stage, but it can save a lot of manpower and increase the production efficiency of bullets by more than ten times. If the number of people engaged in the production is constant, the increase in production capacity will be even greater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the "Foundation Project" of the Nuwa Project was in place, there was no theoretical technical difficulty in the equipment required for the new production line. With the enhancement of the propellant, the accuracy and killing of the firearm will be further improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at this part of the report, Roland can only admire the accuracy of the other's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of ammunition has always been a top priority for the First Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers engaged in related production have been increasing since the expedition to the fertile plains, but the problem of shortage of ammunition has not eased, like the empty knights, the large consumers, light It is the training that can kill a staggering number of bullets, but the process can not be omitted. He has listened to the iron axe to mention the blame on the front line more than once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ammunition capacity can be upgraded, the possibility that the devil will break through the first line of defense by virtue of the quantitative advantage will further decline, or will completely lose the ability to face positive . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the relevant light weapons are concerned, the expert group has not made any further comments - there is no improvement, but the cost-effectiveness of the upgrade is not high, general machine guns and The combination of the bolted/semi-automatic rifle is temporarily enough to cope with the offensive threat of the “degraded demon slayer”. As for the offensive task on the battlefield, it should be borne by heavy weapons such as artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, as long as the enemy is first flattened, the infantry can easily occupy the site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of using resources to improve the guns, it is better to make more cannons, all actions are made by artillery - whether it is offensive, retreating, reinforcements, blocking, First hit a few base bullets and plow the ground over and over again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is only for the quarterly plan that is quick and focused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the five-year plan, individual light weapons are undoubtedly a very important item. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Roland, what he is most interested in is the "One-Year Plan." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its benefits are slightly lower than gunpowder and bullets, and the resources required to invest are relatively large, but it is the key to determining the victory or defeat of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan covers the existing heavy weapons without Winter City, including two major improvement projects and two new projects, of which the Army and the Air Cavaliers each half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the old subject of the Grey House Design Bureau - the crawler tractor and the armored tank developed from it. This is the only occasion where Master Xie can show up. Unexpectedly, after looking at the design drawings, the experts did not criticize them for nothing. Instead, they believed that under low-tech conditions, the program had certain merits. Compared with the equipment itself, they are more concerned about the "nuclear power center." <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland took out the real thing of the ritual Rubik's Cube, the atmosphere of the entire venue could be completely described by the peaks, and even the two government representatives who were aware of the situation were stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, he clearly remembered the scene at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the seemingly unremarkable "stone block", everyone started to look quite complicated. After all, the background setting is set to the background. Look at the face of the book and recognize it. Take out a stone and say that this is the nuclear power unit. Isn’t the expert in the room a fool? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;磐石 has fiercely hit him a few eyes, Director Liu is planning to announce a temporary recess, lest everyone continue to squat, and it is difficult to establish a cooperative atmosphere. once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
