			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf Heart, Shen Chi Wan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victory of this anti-ambush battle quickly spread into the ears of the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He immediately sent a messenger to send his appreciation and encouragement to the fish ball squad in letters and asked them to temporarily return to safety and wait for the replacement of the troops. arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this team defeated a team of old aristocratic coalition forces, the performance of chaos and the will to fight with less wins are excellent. Promote role models. It is obviously more meaningful for the war situation than to continue to respond to the evaders, let them proclaim the deeds, especially at the moment when the first army is fully contracted. Not long ago, he received two unfavorable news in succession. One was the report of the soldiers lurking in the Red Mist Zone. The nobles took over the devil's blocking work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are reports that these knights from multiple families in Yongdong are blocking the team of escapers. As a kind of coercion, their coercion is undoubtedly more efficient than the aliens. many. The first army will take a big risk in the red fog area, and most of the time it can only meet at the periphery, which makes the flow of people at various evacuation points have different degrees of decline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that the devil who made the hand has once again strengthened the attack on the First Army. The news was a complete report. First, there was a post that observed a large number of fearful beasts flying out of the red fog area in the southeast and marching toward Dagong Island. The island defenders then prepared for the defense and interrupted the maritime transport. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, this group of fearful beasts suddenly disappeared into the airspace between the two observation posts, and once again appeared on the head of an evacuation squad. The latter also received information about the beasts going east, and the evacuated personnel who were working overtime, and the results were exposed to the devil's eyes without cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the team made the greatest resistance, it was still completely slain. At present, there is still no complete statistical report, but according to the support team, nearly two thousand migrants have died in the attack, and the military losses are at least 100. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a serious loss made Iron Axe have to make a decision to fully contract the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two unfavorable news can be described as a chain reaction. The staff did not consider the aristocratic rebellion, but did not expect that they would be so fast. In the past two years, the great families of the Yongdong family have not decided on a new king. Now they are "unified" under the devil's will. It cannot be said that it is a kind of irony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is now very clear, the stage of the big immigration has come to an end, and the first army needs to accumulate power to keep the border area that the red fog eventually covers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current number of soldiers arriving at Cangshan and Shenchiwan is about 5,000, less than one-sixth of the total strength, and the devil can mobilize troops. For the time being, he could not easily lose his troops before he could find out the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most worrying thing about the iron axe is that the devil concentrates on the nodes that have not completed the arming when the first military capacity is limited and the strength is insufficient. Then the army will fall into a dilemma that cannot be saved and cannot be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, there is no such thing as a "moving fortress" that is as convenient as an armored train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult," a pro soldier entered the study of the mansion, "the ship of the General Secretary of the Department of General Affairs, Isis Kant, has just arrived at the port." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" The iron axe brows a show, he is still thinking about the people who are worried, the people who are worried about come on their own, "I happen to be fine, I also go The port is picking up her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dock, the iron axe saw the The members of the staff were surrounded by a group of Northland pearls. The faces of the people all showed a liberating look. It seemed that they completely forgot the horror experience when she was tossed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she became a minister only a year or so, she has been respected and recognized by the members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about the aristocrats of the winter and the wolf heart, and then looking at the former Duke’s daughter, the iron axe can’t help but feel the difference, the gap between the nobles is indeed It is like a heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In their work, they all fulfilled their responsibilities." Iron Axe also retaliated with a military ceremony. The two were basically equal in status. There was no gap in conversation. Or, apart from the opening of the squad and the silver moon, the other party was also his. The only person who is willing to talk a few more words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, they didn't give you any surprises?" Itis shrugged and turned to look at the crowd. "It seems everyone. The recent performance is not very qualified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe can not help but raise the corner of his mouth, this Miss North Pearl is still so unspeakable, "If you can It’s not a bad thing to win the war smoothly and steadily.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party did not go deeper, but changed the subject, “Right, This time, along with me, there are weapons newly developed by Majesty based on frontline intelligence. Are you interested in taking a look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe eyes suddenly One bright, "Of course, please lead the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrian came to the heavy-duty loading area, which has been isolated by the defenders alone, the large wooden The boxes are being hoisted one by one from the boat and placed neatly in the corner of the yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already many boxes that have been taken apart, revealing the weapons wrapped in oil paper inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His attention was quickly placed on a small artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good vision," Isis smiled. "This 75mm cannon is the most expensive firearm in this shipment. I hope to use it to fill the force." The firepower gap between the cannon and the fortress gun. It does not require a witch to transport, and it can be pulled around by a horse or two people in a four-wheel state. The shell can also be carried by people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This reminds me of the original front-loading field gun," the iron axe nodded, and he immediately realized the usefulness of this lightweight weapon - compared to the range Short anti-magic grenade and mortars, the new artillery is obviously more suitable for dealing with thick and thick spiders. Even if it is too late to build an artillery position, the frontline soldiers will not be helpless with the spiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for the new rifle there, it is a semi-automatic weapon." Itis said as he walked. "It works well when tested." Two or three shots can reach the same effect as heavy machine guns. You must have been familiar with the idea of ​​this idea. He is the artillery captain of the artillery. Although the official product has undergone improvements, it still It was crowned with the name of the Fanna rifle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this is only a temporary substitute. I heard that the real automatic weapon is currently in the trial production stage, etc. The finished product should be shipped the first time after it comes out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last side is the new anti-devil grenade, which has expanded a lot more than before. It should be that the Ministry of Chemical Industry has improved the propellant..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who visited were gradually dispersed, and when they walked to the edge of the yard, only one group of people There are two of them left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, the war is not going well?" Isis asked suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe stunned, and he realized that it was no accident that the other person brought him alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If this is not the case, you should not be the first Time to come to the dock to meet me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, but you." The iron axe spit out the gas, saying the latest bad news and things he worried about," Before the transport corridor is open, we still need a few months to get all the man and horse ammunition together, but the devil can attack from a certain place at any time. Even if Miss Sylvie, lightning and wheat are coming, I can't monitor such a broad front. When the war is just around the corner, I don't know much about the enemy's situation. This is not a good sign."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out." The silk sinks for a moment, "the transportation channel... I can't do anything, but in terms of intelligence, it may not be so difficult to solve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have an idea? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay. You only consider using the first army to solve the problem. It’s so tricky.” Northland Pearl slowly said, “The devil drives the nobles to look at it for a long time, but it also creates opportunities for us. As long as the devil does not empty every city, we can put a lot of eyes into the enemy. Abdomen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
