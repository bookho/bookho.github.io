			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day after Anna’s recovery, the nightingale resigned to Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although it is not clear why, she is probably the first witch to survive the Awakening Day," said the nightingale excitedly before leaving. Following Roland for a long time, she also began to get used to using the word awakening to describe the transformation of the witch. "I will bring together the sisters of the co-help club, and I hope that you can accept them, just like you accept Anna."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland wants this, an Anna has crossed the hot forging process, so that the town sees the dawn of the industrial age, what does a bunch of witches mean? Of course, considering the safety issue, he still made a reservation, hoping that the other party will go to the desolate mountains after the end of the demon month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the nightingale is obviously impatient. "This winter, there are still many people who have to face this difficulty. If they can tell them earlier, maybe A few people can leave us. Rest assured, the general evil beast can't find my whereabouts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When is your awakening day? ?" Roland finally asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale turned to the horse, "Winter late spring and early spring," she waved her hand and left the prince with a back view. "Don't worry about me, the pain of recent years." It has become more and more faint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer makes Roland think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been thinking about why Anna can survive the Awakening Day so well, after all, Anna said afterwards that a little pain has never been felt, which completely subverts the nightingale. The idea that "the power of the witch comes from the devil, is the evil unclean person" is just the result. The bloody water that evaporates at the time of death and the horror of the epidermis are the unshakable ironclad proof of the fallen power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland did not think about it in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rummaged through the memory of the Four Princes, and did not find proof that the world had a true god or the devil. Since power is not a gift from God, it should not be regarded as a criterion for distinguishing between good and evil. In fact, even if the gods frequently interfere in the world of the mortal world, it is the believer who chooses his own camp before he is given the power, not the other way around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the description of the nightingale, the witch is a convergence of magic, will it be because the magic has nowhere to release and the container itself is damaged? Roland feels that this possibility is very high. The witch is hostile and suppressed by most people, and will inevitably choose to hide her own ability, pretend to be a normal person, and fight in battle. This has led them to have little chance to exert magic before they reach adulthood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland certainly wouldn’t think that his castle was just a feng shui treasure. He asked Anna and learned that before that, she also suffered unbearable pain. To say that this year is different, it is that since she came to the castle, she has been using this power almost every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last reply of the nightingale faintly confirms his conjecture - stealth ability will not attract attention even if it is used frequently, plus she was forced to train this The ability to use it now is even more unscrupulous, so the resurgence of the awakening day will have little effect on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland reinforces Nana Wah’s training immediately after returning to the castle. If there are no wounded on the line, he must treat all kinds of small animals. If you can confirm this speculation through Nana, the meaning of the witch can be described as earth-shaking, and the curse of the devil will become a gift from heaven. As long as he can ensure that his territory is open to witches, the witches will come together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, after this wave of turmoil, everything is back on track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland began to intensify the production of Steam No. 2, and it was also the process of familiarizing Anna with new capabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a shed in the backyard of the castle, but this time it was to shelter the wind and snow. As an experimental base, he feels that it is safer to build on his own site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the nightingale, the witch will be able to stabilize in adulthood and may have new branching abilities. He hasn't seen Anna show new abilities yet, but the use of flames is completely different from before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, can it be called a flame or a problem... Roland thinks, if the previous flame is still within the scope of common sense, today's green The flame is not something that common sense can explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
