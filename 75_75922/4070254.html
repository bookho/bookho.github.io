			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three gods are on! That is... four-winged eagle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The beasts dare to break into the burning place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Save, save lives!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Where is the guard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a panic and unbelievable exclamation in the crowd. Some sandmen pulled out their weapons and climbed the platform to save. Luo Jia, while others want to escape from this place, the scene became confused at one time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash is really real, the big bird that shows the true body from the smoke is a giant evil beast. It is a mixture of eagle and beetle. The back, lower abdomen and skull are covered with striped carapace. There are six paws in the foot. The branches can be clearly seen. The front pair is the strongest, just like the iron tongs. Luo Jia firmly pressed to the ground. The four pairs of wings that should have been as thin as a flap have become thick wings, and it is also the most striking feature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the natural environment, it is absolutely impossible to breed such an ugly monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil beast slammed into her head while pressing the wolf, the claws of the latter were completely unstoppable, and they could only sway their heads to avoid attacks. . The body that can't move can limit her dodge range. Just between the counts, the wolf's cheeks are smashed several times, and the influx of blood stains her fur. If she goes on like this, she will not be able to stay for a long time. The beast is alive and killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash will naturally not allow such things to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assisting the Iron Axe in the Desert Action is to look at Tilly’s share; the victory with the Holy Duel is also due to the choice of the other party, plus the leaves. Her herbal medicine and Nana's treatment, she will seriously respond to the expectations of the other side. But Luo Jia is still a witch. As long as she is not as wicked as a pure person, she cannot sit on the same kind and die in the hands of the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Echo!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash shouted and then rushed to the hybrid, squatting When he squatted again, he hugged his long beak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp corner of the mouth cut through her arms, the blood drip on the wolf's face, but she still does not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf woman looked up weakly and looked at her with her only remaining eyes, a complex look in the dark pupil. At the same time, the echo of the Anshen song just happened to sound, and the smart music gradually dispelled people’s panic, and the flow of people who fled the escape was eased. Come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of interference from the surrounding people, Andrea's direction quickly led to continuous gunshots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the first army who is worried about accidentally injuring the witch, her precise shooting ability guarantees that the goal will be perfect if there is a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes clearly saw that Luo Jia’s claws were shocked, and several bullets hit the same joint continuously, directly to the four-winged eagle. The insect's claws are made into two pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After losing the restraint, Luo Jia turned over and kicked it on the belly of the evil beast and kicked it out. The latter flapped its wings and vacated again – until now, the first army squad rang loudly. Unfortunately, it is not so easy to hit a flying target that can be circling or ups and downs. It is more like an erratic insect than a bird flying like a bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay?" The ashes took off their black robe and covered them on the giant wolf whose body was sharply shrunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Temporary...cough, can't die..." Rejuvenating adult-shaped Luo Jia coughed out two bloody foams, struggling to get up and sit up, tried several times I have not succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not tamper with, it will aggravate your wounds." The ashes groped along her body, the chest side was sunken down, and it could touch the convex The bones, apparently the ribs broke several times in the previous violent impact. It is also more difficult to resist the shape of the giant wolf. If you change the attitude of the adult, then I am afraid that she will have her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beware! It's coming again!" The echo of the echo sounded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All are allowed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes hold Luojia on the spot, avoiding The evil beast attacked the land, and several clan warriors who had no time to evade were smashed out, and the chest smashed down a large piece, and it was impossible to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four-winged eagle clearly has a low intelligence, and it seems that the only one that can hurt it is the lance in the hands of Andrea, dive When attacking Luo Jia, he used the plastron to face the blonde witch as much as possible, and swayed from side to side, and the flight path was a broken line. When Andrea reloads, the evil beast will use the hummingbird and the echo that the arrested person throws at her side to obstruct the filling action, and at the same time turn the direction toward her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andréa has been escaping several times, and after all, in addition to the need to pay attention to the movement of the evil beast, he has to take care of the other two partners. If you don't master the new evolutionary skills, you can spur a strong airflow in the close range, only the evil beast has already thrown it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash could not help but frown, how the four-winged eagle looked like a special witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you simply want to prey, the high side is full of people, just grab one or two and take it away, no one can stop it, but it repeatedly pulls up the dive, or Attacking on Luojia, either staring at Andreia and his entourage, is almost blind to ordinary people, and the brutal killings in the rumors are completely out of tune. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army entered only 50 people in the burning place, there is no way to deal with the goal of air flexibility, and it is so irritating that it has to be led to the large army. Going overhead, using a more intensive shot can hopefully knock it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but...how do you do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Luo Jia grabbed her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take me up," said the wolf, panting, word by word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough... throw me up!" She repeated Again, "When it comes to us, this is the only... the only chance to catch it. I can't act on my own strength, I can only ask you!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't succeed, you may die here." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The best possession of the samurai is always in the battlefield," Luo Jia’s ear hangs down. "So, I have at least stuck to the last moment." You are the most powerful warrior I have ever met... cough... I can experience such a wonderful duel, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From her look, she saw a firm will. After a moment of silence, she nodded. "I understand. But you have made a mistake. This is not our last battle."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...but if you survive, you can't stand like a normal person, you don't have to comfort me," she laughed at herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Injury to this extent, even if it is cured, it may be more difficult for her than to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no witch in the Grey Fort, there is a witch called Nana Wa," Ashes opened his mouth slightly. "She has the ability to heal any injury, even if it is With only one breath left, or her hands and feet broken, she can also restore the injury to the original."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf's ears squinted in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say... is it true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, fighting like this I can go through no less than a hundred games, and there are more powerful enemies there. If you want to temper your skills, you can always find opportunities. So just survive..." Ashes said here, the second half There is no need to repeat the paragraph, she saw a new brilliance in the remaining eyes of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will survive, sure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
