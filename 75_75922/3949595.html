			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland learned from Anna about Tilly’s upcoming 20th birthday. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, he remembered that this was the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t blame him for being too careless. The memory of the Four Princes is a database for him, as long as he needs to look it up when necessary, and inside There are too few contents about current politics and occultism. They are all the tricks of blaming and smug, so he recalls the frequency of this memory is getting lower and lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly is a black history for the four princes, the part is naturally insignificant, and the content related to her is pushed to the lowest level. It seems that I don't want to remember at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly’s birthday does not refer to the awakening day, but to the birth date in the literal sense – because of the particularity of the extraordinary, she does not even know what she is. When she wakes up as a witch, she will not feel the turning point of the magical phagosome every year. So for her, birthday is unique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland read through this memory and found that probably because Tilly was the last child of the Queen, when Wimbledon III was still alive, every winter would be The city held a grand celebration ceremony for her. This treatment has not been received even by the most favored Tefko on weekdays. In addition, he rarely takes care of Tilly, as if he does not care about the other's life. If this is not the case, the four princes will not dare to bully the sister again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned back and he found an interesting place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the day of Tilly’s adulthood, the scale of the celebration is also the largest, even if the subsequent rites cannot be compared. More than four border guards rushed to the kingdom, as well as gifts from the morning sun, the wolf heart and the winter, and even the islands of the fjord sent messengers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite embarrassing for Feifeco and Garcia. They want to give Tilly a lesson and let her know that she is not a person whom her father likes. - The reason why Wimbledon III did this was to compensate the lost queen. The goodness of Tilly was just a solace to the mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no matter whether Roland believes or not, anyway, they believed at the time, so they found the four princes and wanted to marry him, but since then they have been After Tilly’s lessons have been learned, he is no longer willing to provoke this seemingly quiet, deep-rooted but rebellious sister, why he refuses to agree. In desperation, the two had to decide to come by themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific four princes did not know, but the result was that a pair of bears who were gifts of the wolf heart kingdom were poisoned, which was the favorite of Tilly at the time. The gift - when he looked at his sister holding the dead bear cub, he found a hint of pleasure in the heart of the four princes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a royal scum, except for murder and arson, it’s really doing the other bad things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, this is definitely a bad memory for Tilly Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading it, Roland thought about it and quickly thought about what to send. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spread a blank sheet and began to draw his own gift drawings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?" The nightingale came out of his head, "A bear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, bear puppet, can hold the kind of sleep," Roland laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to one of my few gift-giving experiences, most girls have little resistance to cute, furry gifts, and the height of the doll is even more It is a perfect blend of these two points. Of course, the simple puppet production is not difficult for him, and it is not unusual. Since it is a prince and has a group of witches behind to provide technical support, it can naturally be more unique. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tilly’s birthday, Roland came to her room with a gift . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knocking on the door, there was only one person in the room. When she saw herself, she gave a slight glimpse. "How come you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
