			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the symbol of the industrial age? The first thing that Roland thought of was the steaming steam, the train that was running on the rails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil-filled cast iron cylinders, the thick crankshaft and the huge iron wheel, the rhythmic noise and vibration, and the whistle that cuts the sky - right For him, the first thing to know about the beauty of machinery is to start with a steam train. Compared with the later generations, which use the high-precision machining to reduce the tremor and the mechanical system that emphasizes the sound insulation and sound absorption measures, it is undoubtedly more intuitive to show the power and beauty of the industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also wants to spread the rails in the territory, let the train drag the passengers and goods to and from the west, but the ideal is good, but the reality is not People's intentions - don't say that making a steam train, just a lot of steel needed to lay railroad tracks far exceeds the iron ingot production capacity of the North Slope Furnace Group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the second best, the manpower-driven bicycle became Rolandâ€™s best choice. The more the flat roads in the territory are repaired, the greater the bicycle benefits. And compared to a complex steam train, it requires little maintenance and occasionally smears the chain. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you plan to mass-produce bicycles, you can no longer let Anna hand-made, so he first had to set up a factory to train a group of professional workers for production and vehicle assembly. Considering that the Kingdom Road will not be completed until the spring of next year, the scale of the factory does not need to be too large. After Anna has created the machine tools needed by the assembly line, the workers will be familiar with the process of each link and produce ten in one month. Come to the car. Among them, the highest technical content is the chain. The chain piece needs to be punched out by the machine, and then the pin is manually inserted and connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, rubber parts like tires and brakes still need to be made by Soroya's ability - but this part of the work is not big, just prepare the bottom The mold, the magic pen can quickly draw a lot. The same is true for bearings. Rolling bearings with reliable performance cannot be used. A small steel sleeve can be used as a sliding bearing. The inner ring is covered with a smooth mirror coating, and the effect is not much worse than the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bicycle was first introduced, only the nobles could afford this kind of expensive transportation. In order to spread to the masses, in addition to publicity, Roland also planned Implement an installment payment system to minimize purchase pressure. Of course, only the people who have obtained the ID card can apply for this payment method from the City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three tossed in the garden for an afternoon, Carter Lannis was worthy of the name of the chief knight, took the lead in mastering the cycling skills; the iron axe followed The second successful circle around the garden. Only Barov tried for more than a dozen times and failed to succeed. It was not awkward to fall, and he could not move straight. In the end, Roland had to let Soroya draw a static picture of his standing next to the bicycle and his hands holding the handlebars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you do this?" asked the witch after completing four huge posters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to add two more words," Roland thought for a moment. "The above is written: "The new era mount, I have it, you have it." This will be the case." The following is written: "The bicycle factory recruits workers, the salary is considerable, the treatment is generous, and there is a chance to get a new car that belongs to you free of charge. You can register with the city hall through the primary education."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After handling the bicycle poster, the prince returned to the office and squatted for dinner. For a while, the pro-guards called Camo Stern.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of mercury sulphate has finally made a breakthrough, and the development of a new generation of weapons can also On the agenda, there is no doubt that the calibre of the hot weapon era represents justice, and the rate of fire represents freedom; the greater the power, the more glory, the more turrets are more equal... but the problem is that, as this develops, The two acids produced by the laboratory method will soon not be able to keep up.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp; For example, if you want to increase the rate of fire, you must discard the black powder that has a lot of residue and change it to a smokeless * drug, that is, fire cotton, or a mixture of fire cotton and nitrification * glycerin. The same is true for explosives. It is okay to do not use trinitrate-based toluene (TNT). It can be replaced with nitrated starch. In addition to poor stability, the power is even greater than TNT.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above is a large amount of high-concentration fuming nitric acid, and a large amount of concentrated sulfuric acid is required for purifying nitric acid. These are not the production points of the laboratory. In other words, there is no way to use it. Industrial law produces two acids, and even if more efficient weapons are developed, they will fall into the trap of being usable.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
