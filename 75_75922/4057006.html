			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like this is the case, Roland thinks, the ashes have said that the difference between the gods and the superpower is not in strength and reaction, but It lies in wisdom. If a god psychic possesses the witch's mind and has uninterrupted life, the battle experience accumulated over hundreds of years will be enriched to a terrible degree, and such a warrior will be even stronger than the extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is fighting against the full version of the Gods in the Windwind Ridge, the next nine or nine will be reversed. As long as the church has turned the army into zero, it has been divided into a number of small teams to sneak into the hinterland of the gray fort, and harassment operations everywhere will definitely prevent him from being prevented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the long adaptation time is no longer the focus. As long as the soul can continue to move, it is an inevitable choice to retain the powerful veterans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only question is, how many god warriors can Achilles accumulate before the Red Moon? The body with strong strength is also more tolerant than ordinary people. The age of aging is about 100 years old. If you are involved in the transformation ceremony at the age of 20, you can use it for almost 70 or 80 years. Even without calculating the conversion and soul transfer failure rate, a witch can only make two shells, which directly limits the upper limit of the army. If you want to build a savage army of thousands of people, in the four hundred years of inheritance, the witch consumed is probably a terrible number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he asked this question, Felice gnawed her lip and replied, "All."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned, and some doubts that he was wrong, "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the extraordinary, she plans to have all the witches Transformed into a god penalty force to resist the final doom." She repeated it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, how can this be done? If you want to overpower the high-level devil in your ability, you must be a trained warrior, if you To get such a warrior, isn't it necessary to reserve enough shells to transfer the soul?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but there is still a way to save the soul, It is first transferred to other containers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other...container?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" We call it dormancy," Felice said, and Roland shuddered. "In the meantime, the dormant does not need any consumption, and loses all perception until it is reawakened - otherwise you think we have spent the hardest After the initial break with the Star City, we didn't have a usable corps of the gods, and we all survived by dormancy. Of course, some witches are excluded... for example, Pasha."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you see her, you will understand." Silk did not elaborate, "In short, Akaris adults intend to train a skilled warrior with a hundred-year cycle, and then let the soul sleep, in order to save the body's consumption. In this way, the Star City will have the ability to continue to transform. God's penalty army, when the red moon comes, once again awaken all souls, so that the number of gods can greatly exceed the limit of the witch group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that every witch who lives on the eve of the battle will be a transformational material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wendy, Sylvie, and the leaves all showed an unbearable color. Although they couldn’t see the expression of the nightingale, Roland knew that her face must be very gloomy at the moment. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Akaris himself...do she also intend to participate in the transfer of souls?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not at all," Felice sighed. "I heard this from the adult of Pasha. The Queen of Stars and her followers didn't want to continue life from the beginning. They are going to put the rest of their lives into it." To the re-casting of the new order, to ensure that the God's penalty plan does not deviate from the predetermined track. Only when she is above the extraordinary, can she have the strength and prestige of the leading federation... and only the flame-like red hair, It is the symbol that the will of the Star City will never go out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, her eyes show a very complicated light, fear, sigh, and respect. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland faintly understands the thoughts in her mind—the clear intentions are left, but they are still shocked by the spirit of the other party. In order to defeat the devil, the witch community can continue. Even if the price paid is so great, the Queen of Stars can still move forward without hesitation. Such a person, even if it is an opponent, still deserves respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
