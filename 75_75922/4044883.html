			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two-day dream trip, the castle’s grey slate roof once again appeared in front of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached out and repeatedly fisted and opened, except for the strange heat flow, every move was so consistent with the feelings in the dream world, if not Being able to take advantage of the fall, he can't tell the illusion and reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the brain really simulate this point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s heart could not help but raise doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially the "star cluster" that is like a magical cyclone - he never really saw the magic, if the power of nature is shaped by magic In the dream, it should be blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding a strange focal face man, and the heat flow that resonates with the cluster... He suddenly is uncertain about the previous inference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that I can’t accommodate such a complicated and vast world of dreams in my mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the dream is not in the subconscious, then where is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a day of thinking, Roland never got a satisfactory answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and decided to put these things aside for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t understand, don’t think about it, or do something important first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After visiting the library with Jielu, he borrowed a lot of design materials that could be used - even if some were just turned over, they could count Come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the books also comes with the matching and performance of some commonly used alloys, which will undoubtedly save the test time of Anna and Lucia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, the third generation of machine tools used to create higher precision parts will be available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the first batch of operators may have to be personally guided by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the people in all parts of the Grey Fort is constantly gathering in the West, and those who have settled in the 66 will continue to pass the universal education assessment, a batch of approval At the time of the job, Roland felt particularly excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an ever-increasing process, and he has now opened up the situation, waiting for the year to unify the gray fort, no winter city may have the opportunity to touch the industrial age threshold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once in the industrial age, this territory will be changed dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the afternoon, Construction Minister Carl Vabert brought news of the completion of Route 67 - the construction time of this road compared to Kingdom Road A lot faster, in addition to the shorter distance, the skill level of the workers is also a key point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to previous commitments, all the workers trained by the Ministry of Construction have all been attributed to Bentham. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, if you don't have a new road construction plan, I plan to send them all to the residential construction project," Carl said. "Although it will add a portion. Salary expenses, but there is a shortage of residential areas in Wintertown.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows this, a total of nearly 5,000 people in the construction team, half of them The reason for the busy construction of the new community is to accommodate the large population that the City Hall has drawn from all over the country. In just one year, the original town has expanded by at least three times, and it does not include the newly opened farmland south of the Chishui River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The road is unfinished," he spread out the map of the border area and pointed to the North Slope Road. "I plan to build a railway that runs directly from the mine." It is used to load the coal that comes from the west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there already a road here..." Carl suddenly had a meal, "You just said... Railway?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
