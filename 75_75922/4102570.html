			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the church is hiding something, or the nun is lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter, Isabella really can't think of what they need to make orders. After all, it is a fact that they are abandoned. From the bleak look of this group, only Afraid to drag on for another half a month, the monastery will become a dead place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the former, the church recalls all the staff to Hermes, but does not have any defense against the ladder and the old holy city, then they really want What to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She temporarily suppressed the guess in her heart and looked at the leader. "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Returning, my name is autumn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You never thought about fleeing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The nun screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The courtyard is thick and thick, but it is not impossible to climb. One and a half months is enough for you to build a wooden ladder or firewood. It is a feasible way to pile up under the gate and directly burn down the door leaf and blow the iron rope.” Isabella strangely said, “Since you can think of sending a representative to report the situation, why not choose to go out together? The food supply is interrupted here. Even if there is no morning army, there is only one dead road to stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the silence for a while, he muttered, "But... leave Here, where can we go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes everyone in the room bow their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never left the monastery..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although you can't eat enough, you can still get something at least every day, not much better outside." There are also orphans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going to someone else's words has become what it used to be."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Book It is said that we should not take begging as a matter of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to... live like the past."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that looking at the confused people, Isabella’s heart suddenly became clear. They are not all defensive because of the church's orders, but the habits of life make it difficult for them to have other choices. This is a mixed news. The nuns have said that it is good to say that if the hearts of the orphans are killed, then if they are the dead faithful believers of the church, then they should have a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, I want to ask you a question," she took a breath and asked in a deep voice, "Why do you call me the Pope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Autumn’s timid look, for a moment, said, "Men’s Majesty is now dying, and the three bishops have passed away, Hull. Metz has not issued a new appointment or dismissal order. According to the principle of automatic replacement, you are the closest person to the temple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isabella , please help us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't leave us here, we are willing to accept any punishment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please take us to Hermes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuns pleaded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that they are not premeditated for their reasons, but hope to regain the attention of the Holy City, Isabella thought. Although the principle of replacement does not apply to the top of the church, how can the people who fall into the water account for these details, as long as there is a line of life, they will seize it, even if it is straw, it will not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, she quickly came up with an idea. "I have an important thing to tell you this time, I have heard it!" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church is no longer the church of the past," Isabella sighed. "Mean is not the real pope. He not only betrayed the adult of Oberlin, but also stole the throne of the pope! In fact, The adult of Brian wants to pass on the other person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like a stone that stirs up a thousand waves, and everyone suddenly feels blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The man is his first pure, clean." She didn't know what her thoughts would be, but since she opened her head, She decided to do her best. "The Grey Fort is not the enemy of the church. In order to fight against the real strong enemy, the great Oberline even hopes to form an alliance with the Grey Fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean... evil beast?" Someone couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s more terrible than the evil beast," Isabella shook her head. "These are recorded in the church, only a few people can see it. I was not willing to let the pures take power away, secretly launching a rebellion and framing the lord who wants to serve as an ambassador to the Grey Fort. The battle of the Cold Wind Ridge broke out. Fortunately, Mayn’s tricks failed to succeed, I am here. The battle survived, and the rebel messenger died in more than a month. Undoubtedly, this is the punishment of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So there is no final battle There is no one to keep the monastery until the last moment -" she paused. "You are safe now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is a nun or an orphan, it is revealed A look of incredulity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...the punishment of the priest..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fundamentals of what they do I am not qualified to be a priest, I am not guilty of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a quiet moment in the compound, and then a huge cheer broke out. "Great, oh Be merciful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long lived Isabella!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the Pope! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella pressed down and pressed everyone down, "I have said that the Pope is not me, the principle of replacement is not Applicable to the transfer of the right to teach, I am only the ambassador of the Pope, just like before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you also represent the Church of Hermes! "Autumn excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I have a task to hand over to you," Isabella can't help, "Of course, after you fill your stomach."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people who stand up and brushed up again. "Please let me know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She knows that these people are not so supportive of her because they believe her... They are abandoned, the door to fate has been closed to them, and now there is hope for a return to the church, naturally willing to give everything - even this The church is not true or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the real Hermes church is still alive, maybe they will think about whether this choice is correct after they get out of trouble and calm down, but now this premise is no longer Re-existence - waiting for the arrival of the first army, everything she said will become a reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break old concepts, make up a half-truth story, and instill a new "fact" into them, so that Roland can really Master this land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple, I need you to restore the order of the old holy city." Isabella said in an orderly manner, "Autumn, you first put the other two monasteries People gather and tell my words to them. Then, before tonight, organize the distribution of all the children's rations. The first army of the Grey Fort is connected with you. They already know the rebellion of Mayn and others. It’s difficult for you. Next, you need a notice from each household, by the way, who is leaving, those people are still there, if you encounter a traitor or a sect, immediately notify me.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the order issued, the nuns quickly responded and then turned around and got busy. Despite their situation and no substantial improvement before half an hour, the look of everyone on the face has become completely different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was quickly dismantled. When a nun took the children to line up and left the monastery, one of them suddenly bent down to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
