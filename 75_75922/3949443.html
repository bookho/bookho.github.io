			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third day after the fall, the Margaret Chamber of Commerce arrived at the Bianbu Town Pier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the caravans resumed their former size, and the ten sailboats were lined up in a row, steadily docked at the trestle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His lord the prince, we met again," said Yueyuewan businessman Jia Momo, who said, "Mrs. Margaret said that the first Has the steamship been remodeled?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true," Roland laughed. "But in order to guarantee the quality of the goods, it still needs three or four days of trials. In order to check the reliability of the power system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really exciting," Marlan clap his hands. "The fleet will take so many days to unload." Time, we can wait here. May I ask, can I board the steamship when I test?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, it is a brand new vessel It’s very different from the previous sailing. I have to tell you how to operate it. But according to the plan, these are the contents of tomorrow.” Roland made a gesture with me. “The most important thing now is to relax and get tired. Body, haven't you had lunch yet? I am already ready in the castle meeting room. A sumptuous feast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every time you come here, you will have a good meal," Margaret said with a smile. "I am really hungry now." Calling straight - those wheat cakes and dried meat are as hard as stones, and it's hard to swallow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reliable preservation technology in this era, so Most of the dry food is really dry and hard, which makes Roland think of canned food. When the light industry develops, it is definitely the best choice for long-distance travel and sailing merchants to make a variety of delicious and convenient food cans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the banquet ended, Hogg patted his belly with satisfaction. "This bowl of mushroom soup will let me swallow my tongue. I seem to taste the taste of Haizhen, stewed chicken and pork bones at the same time. Your court chef is really skilled."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I prefer the dessert on the meal, called ice cream... right?" Margaret said. "I guess it should be made of milk and honey. Then use the saltpeter to freeze into an ice crystal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Add some butter and egg white, otherwise you can't do it so soft," Roland added. I don’t know how much the volume of saltpeter this time?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is still only one boat,” the businesswoman shook her head. “The Alchemists’ Association is still buying the saltpeter in Datun. The Prime Minister even sent a patrol to help them search for the goods in the market. A group of guys with the name of the sage bought it and the robbers were no different. Shipped from Chishui City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The goods shipped this month are mostly washing stones?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Hogg sipped the white wine in the cup and filled himself up. "Although the number may be a bit more, but the last time you said it, try to get more, I can remember In my heart. In addition to washing stones, there are good iron ingots and lead ingots. Recently, few cities like you need these things," he sighed. "The mining business is getting worse." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the impact of the civil war. Roland’s heart is thinking that purchasing power is gradually declining. If it continues for two or three years, it is basically the rise in food prices. Hungry rhythm everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what happened to the West?" Margaret suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fleet encountered a road on the way to the town. A lot... um," she paused for a moment, seemingly thinking about the wording. "A lot of floating corpses. They are dressed in ragged clothes, so they float on both sides of the river. In addition to the corpse, there are some broken planks on the water and The rope is like a ship sinking on a reef. But there is no reef in the river, so I think..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, that’s Tefco’s invasion. The fleet of the West, "Roland put on a look of injustice, and told the battle a week ago. "They have got the punishment they deserve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
