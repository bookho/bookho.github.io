			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perro stepped out of the cabin and did not smell the expected wood smell. The trestle on the side of the ship was obviously new. The old dock was enlarged. Doubling more than once, stepping on it no longer makes a squeaky sound, but a reassuring snoring - obviously the joint between the boards is very strong and the materials are quite thick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the dock, several guards in uniform uniforms came over. The head of the person looked at the family emblem hanging on the lion's heart mast. "Would you like... the Helmond of the honeysuckle family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes "Pello nodded. Such an inquiry made him very useful. "I am Pedro Hermon, who came here with the invitation of His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The iron axe has already explained us, please come with me," the guard made a gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Walk?" He gave a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the horse has been dismantled," the other party said with a smile. "Reassured, the road in the town is very good."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyro quickly understood what it means to be a "good walk" in the guard's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark streets are flat and spacious, the snow on them is swept away, and even the water is not seen much - the road seems to be Many black stones are condensed, and the middle is covered with small gaps. It is smooth and bright after being soaked in water. What surprised him was that there is more than one such way. Every 30 steps, you can see a straight and staggered martyrdom. The degree of regularity is like a square drawn with strokes. After walking for a quarter of an hour, I didn't see a muddy land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perro was surprised to find that the town had completely failed to match the appearance of the memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, is this really...Bian Bianzhen?" Seth looked up and looked around. "It’s not that this place is just a temporary residence for mining. "Is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It used to be the case," the guard said with a smile. "But since the temple has come down, everything has become different. The roads in the town were built six months ago. Thousands of people were busy every day, and they could build one in a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peero noticed that he had a disguise in his tone, as if he was proud to be a member of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... this is incredible! On both sides of the street are evenly arranged trees. He can imagine that once in the summer, the lush foliage obscures the scene of the scorching sun; then the houses - the low earth houses and the ragged wood hotels have disappeared. Surrounded by angular brick houses, each of which is two to three stories, the style is almost identical, it is obviously built by the same stonemason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can he transform a barren town into this look for a year! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With surprise and incomprehension, Pei Luo followed the guard into the castle area, and the guide was replaced by a knight in armor, and his attendants were all Stay outside the fence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until after stepping into the lord's castle, Pei Luo found the feeling of a year ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't seem that there is much change here. The prince's castle is obviously much smaller than the fortress of the Duke of Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight pushed the door of the sitting room and made a request, and he quickly saw the prince sitting in the main position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland. Your Highness Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome to Bianbu Town," Roland smiled. "Mr. Ambassador." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is no change in His Highness, and Pei Luo’s heart is inexplicably relieved. He raised his hand and raised his chest, and respectfully took a gift," the honeysuckle family Your tribute, Your Highness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit down," the other nodded. "I told you to come because of a very important event." This matter is related to the future of the entire West, and naturally includes the Long Song Fortress. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
