			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting sun slanted, the rolling heat wave began to subside, and the summer day that screamed for a day gradually subsided. However, compared to the sleeping islands that are surrounded by the sea, the castle still looks a bit stuffy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evelyn, who was sweaty, walked up the second floor and pushed open the bedroom door, and a cool moment suddenly enveloped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today's test is hard," a woman with a black hair and a mature and capable woman smiled. "How, is it smooth?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She called the book, the oldest witch in the co-help club, and a very friendly predecessor. After only a short day, she has already felt the care and concern of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Evelyn replied with some frustration. "Everyone else has shown his ability. When it is my turn, His Royal Highness only Asked a few questions and let me go. Is it...he thinks that I am useless?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book is coming over a glass of ice water, "Nothing works." The ability, only the ability that has not yet been developed, this is what Roland has always said to us, so you don't have to worry about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." She I took the cup and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Worried that it can’t be used up and being left out?" The book couldn’t help but smile. "If it’s a previous co-help, it’s possible, but in Bianbu Town, His Royal Highness has never treated any witch differently. This hummingbird can testify."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl who is looking for clothes in the closet looks up, "Probably That's right, like me, mystery, Lily, and Miss Nana, there is nothing to do recently, and my Highness encourages us to play the Kwant card."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unpleasant?" Evelyn's eyes widened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s incredible, right? Work hard when you have something, play happily when you’re fine, he said that,” the hummingbird paused. “But I think Her Royal Highness. There is still a little bit of eccentricity. He is obviously better for Anna."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was the first witch he knew, and he was naturally emotionally deep. More," the book knocked on her head. "Quickly clear the clothes, and there will be less tap water later." Then she looked at Evelyn. "You come with us too."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where?" the latter snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shooting," the book smiled. "In the summer, there is nothing more pleasant than taking a shower under the shower."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Evelyn followed the two into the bathroom, they couldn’t help but scream. She seems to walk into a broad grassland, in front of the sea of ​​clouds and mountains, the sunset glow from the window, reflected on the wall, the cloud is stained with a touch of golden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soloya's masterpiece," the book laughs, "This is not a traditional decorative painting. You know when you take off your shoes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evelyn carefully placed the wooden sandals in the shoe cabinet at the door. When I stepped on the "grassland" barefoot, I immediately understood the meaning of the other party. The fine touch of the soles of the feet is like a dense grass, and the tip of the grass also contains full drops of water, just like a heavy rain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book rolls off the clothes, let go of the bun that is bundled into a ponytail, and a long black hair falls down. I saw her walk to the wall, twisted the wrench, and suddenly spouted dozens of water lines in the shower head protruding above the top of the head, shrouded her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about it, is it convenient?" The hummingbird handed a piece of something round to her. "This is the toiletries that the Royal Highness invented, when it comes to showering." I feel that I can't use it anymore. Come, I teach you how to use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When Evelyn returned to the room again, the whole body felt a little lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has never experienced such a comfortable bathing. When the soap is rubbed out of the body with soap, and then washed away by the clear water, the sticky feeling of the body is swept away. Empty, replaced by refreshing and smooth. After changing to clean clothes, the sultry air seemed to cool down, raising her arms, and she could smell the rose fragrance left on her skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evelyn is still unbelievable. She was born in the outer city of Wangdu. She runs a pub at home. Although the visitors are mostly peasants, the topics that can be talked about are inseparable from the nobles in the inner city and their life in the winery. She also heard a lot when she was drinking for the guests. For example, gold-plated baths filled with wine, and milk baths filled with rose petals... But even in their rumored rumors, none of them can match her personal experience today – at least Evelyn doesn’t think How comfortable it is to bathe with wine and milk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Associated with the owner of the castle is a real prince, it is normal to be comfortable and enjoyable. But the witches actually lived the same life as the royal family, which was hard to imagine for her. It is a great hope to maintain a normal and peaceful life before going to the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hungry?" The book dried his hair and re-tied his throat. "It’s time to open the meal, let’s go to the lobby."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room on the first floor, the long square wooden table is full of various dishes, Evelyn roughly counts, there are six pots of light meat. There are also egg tarts, vegetable soups and grilled mushrooms, which are no worse than the welcome dinner last night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When other witches are in place, everyone is starting to move. She noticed that some people used a pair of wooden sticks to pick up food in addition to the knife and fork, and the same was true of the Highness. He even picked up the knife and fork, and the wooden stick in his hand flew up and down, which seemed very flexible. The food in the bowl also has no large steaks or whole chickens. Unlike the common foods in the pub, the steaks are cut into small pieces, and the wild boar legs are removed from the bones. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dinner was over, the prince suddenly clap his hands. "I have recently researched two new things and intend to promote them as merchandise, but it is not clear. How, I want you to give it a try first, what can be put forward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it, eat?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, I want to try!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And me!"<br /><br />&nbsp The witches of the Assisting Association suddenly cheered, and Evelyn looked at the book with a blank look. The latter smiled and explained: "His Royal Highness often invents some novelty, such as the soap you used before. There are also perfumes, chopsticks, ice cream... He will let us try it before it is officially put into production."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," the prince cleared Clear throat, "The first thing is white wine. It is more mellow and more intoxicating than the common ale and fruit wine, so the underage witch is not allowed to participate. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Highness, this is prejudice!" Lightning yelled. "I can drink more than the adult sailors!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That doesn't work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔..." The little girl raised her mouth, and Roland was unmoved. The servant was ordered to bring the good liquor to the adult witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eveline also put three cups in front of him - only the crystal clear crystal glass has different drinks, a cup is transparent and colorless, Like a clear water, a cup is milky white, and the last cup is a sparkling orange-yellow. Under the pulsating candlelight, you can see some tiny floating objects, like unfiltered fruit wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are white wine mixed with apple juice, white wine with milk and pure white wine," Roland said. "Ice can be added according to your own taste. The more the wine is lighter.” Then he smiled at Evelyn. “You have been in the tavern of Wangdu, and the ability is to brew different kinds of drinks. I hope to hear your evaluation of this new wine.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evelyn couldn’t help but jumped twice, and she took a sip of the orange-flavored cup, as she said, The taste of liquor is much stronger than that of ale, and even some thorny throat, the tip of the tongue feels a bit bitter, but the fragrance of apple dilutes its influence, and finally it is the mellowness of the wine itself - several flavors reverberate in the mouth, she still For the first time, I tasted such a great wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white wine with milk is more gentle, the bitterness almost disappears, she can taste it, in addition to milk, it should also put some honey or sugar, The sweetness and the scent of the wine blend together to create a new taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
