			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sun was hidden a little between the mountains, the entire plain was dyed with a layer of red glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of red is different from life, and it looks pure and thorough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time at this time, Ursuk always likes to stay high and feel the distance from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it can fly higher, the disturbance of the magic will not only break the silence, but also the dome that will never touch will deepen the sense of distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, the golden clouds and the red and purple sky seem to be only one step away from it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This experience is not common. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time, the top of the head is covered by a wandering cockroach, although in it can make Ösluck feel more comfortable, but also it is separated from the sky A layer of thick yarn was put on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is probably one of the few people in the ethnic group who do not like to stay in the tower of birth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Erskuk does not consider himself to be a different kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just more than anyone else’s desire to embrace the source of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the source comes from above the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans call it the Red Moon, but it is also a bit appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all the inheritance has been passed down, the ethnic group will usher in the final ascension - the heavens and the earth will open the passage and accept them into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that there is a wider place than the existing world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also be the residence of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By then, they will be a hundred times stronger than they are now, and the body will become immortal because of its magical power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this rumor that has been passed down to this day, Ursuk did not believe in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also tried to fly to the deep sky by its own power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in the case that it is impossible to replenish life, it finds that after rising to a certain height, various obstacles occur - such as a sudden drop in temperature , armor icing, poor blood flow, difficulty breathing, etc. If you use magic to fight discomfort, then the breathing cans that are carried will soon be exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It flew the highest, almost letting himself die on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it was that attempt that deepened its desire for the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in the purple-black sky, it did see something, but afterwards it was difficult to describe it in words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to say something, it’s probably the same as a flash of scale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means that rumors are not without foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it also heard a faint call. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a whisper, it’s like a low-pitched voice that echoes directly in your mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osruk knows that it is a sign that the conscious world is moving closer to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is always a little worse than the higher level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiative to open the doors of the two worlds can be called Maharaja. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as it closed its eyes and felt the warmth of the afterglow, and the late wind coming from behind, there was a footstep behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporter is its first ascending bodyguard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." Erskuk didn't return. "Continue to keep monitoring."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The guards did not leave immediately afterwards, but hesitated and said, "But those bugs will really act according to our plan? They should have fully understood your ability to be... ... In order to lay the trap, we pay a lot of money. If the Lord of Heaven knows..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, your statement is not without reason. But I think it's worth doing." Erskuk opened his eyes and looked south - now standing on the "corner", it can faintly see the black track. In the six-month temptation, many of the primitive bodies died in front of human positions, but they never wavered to the other side. That trajectory is like a root, and it grows slowly but is tenacious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is still in its memory, the first time humans do not rely on the city wall, they can not fall in the face of confrontation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this method is awkwardly ridiculous, if it is placed in a covered area, it can have countless ways to make the opponent pay a heavy price, but in this broad It was unexpectedly difficult on the plain. The limited strength of the hand is certainly a major reason, even if the monarch mobilizes more troops to give it to him, it will inevitably suffer a lot of losses against the human beings who have fully established their footholds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must kill this evolving army in the new phase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think of the recent battle? Is there a feeling that it is difficult to walk?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silenced, "That's because we are fighting in the water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s the enemy that made us fight back." Erskuk corrected, "We also The outpost was established to try to further expand the supply of life floating, but it did not function for 400 years ago, just because humans now have a farther attack than "tombstones." Whether you think of the other person as a bug, you must admit it. Plus our every move is under the watch of the witch, so we feel that we are hitting the wall. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It paused, extending the right hand to the black track and clenching it into a fist. "As long as we have not erected the tower of birth, we cannot change it." This status quo. Therefore, I have to smash the eyes of the other party, ruin their eyes, and smash their arms, so that they will never have the possibility to reapply them - even if they pay the price of two "corners"! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the words, Erskuk showed a sneer, and the magical power spewed out, causing the surrounding air to tremble. It knew at the end of the black track. Someone in the camp is watching it. This move is only a shock to the human alert, let them mess together.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I vow to follow you! "Feeling its raging power, the guards bowed their heads respectfully.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of Ursuk did not say it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels that it is only one line away from the next breakthrough.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war may be an opportunity.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, bloody killing has always been the most effective way to improve, even if you become a king, you will not reject such a challenge.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it can cross the hurdle and be promoted to the new Maharaja, then no matter what the idea of ​​the Scorpio Lord, it is impossible to care about it.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether humans will act, Ursuk is not worried.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the greed of the opponent, it has long been known.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the bait is full, they will not let go.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun finally falls completely Under the mountain, the last bit of afterglow also dissipated The sky was completely covered by the night, leaving only a faint starlight and a darkness on the top of the head.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene seems to overlap with the scene when it sprints into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
