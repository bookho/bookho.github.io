			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling...is really wonderful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis took a deep breath and savored the bloody smell in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the fear of spreading in the hearts of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The encirclement is rapidly shrinking, and the so-called resistance lasts only for a short period of time, and it is broken by the unjustified attack of the witch. In the eyes of these Tsemula remnants, there is no difference between the aristocrats and the ordinary people who are high on the weekdays. As long as they have no ability, they are the bodies of mortals. There is no hesitation in moving hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they are not killing themselves for themselves, but being instructed by another mortal. She is also sure that under the influence of that mortal, these godly witches will also follow their own orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if she is the same as the other person, she is just a mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the charm of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of interests, goals, desires, and cravings through the connection and negotiation between people forms a peculiar order through which Even mortals can control the power that is far stronger than themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, the screening has been completed." When the last person fell, "Seventy-six" Felice dropped a long sword full of gaps, turned Reported to Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of more than sixty people lay flat in a pile, and the blood flowing out of it condensed into a dark red mass, like a hot wax under the bonfire general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene was silent, and all the aristocrats who were still alive were pale, and they couldn’t dare to speak out, fearing that they would become the next body. As for the three "swingers", they have fallen to the ground and trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask the same question again now, even if there is no nightingale, she knows how the other party will answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fear, loyalty is guaranteed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, none of the aristocrats who were removed were innocent people - during the first half of the banquet, Isabella had already punished them The stone is completely erased, and under the lie of the nightingale, it is no problem to read it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest mistake of them is to overestimate themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule of the land, in charge of thousands of dead and aristocrats, still appear to be vulnerable in the face of higher levels of power. After the First World War, half of the surrounding areas around Chishui will be swept away. In contrast, her adventures in the two major families in Yongye City are not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the plan was finally perfect, and gave her enough trust, from the witch to the Tsinghua’s survivors, every step Her arrangement was staged as scheduled, and even five questions and answers were passed without a change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only episode is the glass that was last thrown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t know why she must use the glass as a signal. According to common sense, this step is superfluous, and the throwing action is difficult for all the guards. At the same time, it is easy to be covered up, and it is puzzling to prepare the drinks in advance. However, after seeing the effect, he accidentally added a mystery to him, and with the statement of mind reading, the shock effect was further improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably this is the level that the king can comprehend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis suppressed the excitement and licked her lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice to play Roland Wimbledon is really the right choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, she couldn’t help but look at the king, hoping to share this happiness with him, only to find that the expectation on the latter’s face has disappeared. No trace, even in the eyes, revealed a rejection and boredom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any other ballroom in the villa?" asked Roland with a scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let everyone go, I have something to say," he nodded. "As for the insurgents, you have to count the counts and give me the list, tonight."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...Yes, Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, the doors and windows are opened, and the body is disposed of as soon as possible. This rust smells It’s really an appetite.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I’ll send someone to do it!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart of the North Pearls suddenly realized that His Majesty did not expect this killing. He expected that after the aristocrats left the scene, they could leave a red water with a smooth political order and controlled by the City Hall. For the onlookers, the deterrent of the mine was escorted. It is obvious that there is not a pile of corpses to be effective. But as far as killing is concerned, he can't say how much he likes it. Even the bloody atmosphere in the hall makes him repel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous sense of pleasure suddenly dissipated a lot, realizing that Isis was hesitant after this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is your own plan a little too hot? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe killing half on the spot, will the remaining dragging out be better? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the difference between the displayed preferences and the superiors is very likely to cause the other party’s resentment. As a result, her power path may be bumpy. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone moved to the next hall, Roland’s frowning brows finally spread out. He cleared his throat and whispered. "You don't have to worry, only The rebels will be severely punished. Now that the rebellion has been leveled, it is imperative to restore order in Chishui, and this will require your assistance and cooperation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please ask your majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles are kneeling down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded with satisfaction. "Get up, this is the first task assigned to you. After the land was returned to the king, the original land would be meaningless." I need you to concentrate on Chishui City - not just the mansion, but also the free people, serfs and livestock in the fief."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But... oh, if Moved around the people, Chishui City did not have enough food to feed them," Earl of Delta slammed his head. "Even if you arrange these people into the fields, there are not so many farms available for farming nearby. If you drive away, I am afraid that it will cause famine and riots..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, this year you will switch to a kind of wheat called "Gold No. 2", the output is close Ten times the common wheat ears. Secondly, the population that can't live can be transferred to the west. No matter how many, I can take it right. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sound of breathing in the air.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten, ten times? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there such a wheat present?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But our people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After reclaiming the land, those people are naturally They are no longer your accomplices, and their stay is left to their own decision. Roland interrupted. "Before the land utilization rate was too low and the population was scattered. There were only thousands of tens of thousands of acres of self-governing leaders. This is extremely inconvenient for policy implementation. Therefore, the contraction of the big city is the center. Necessary. I know that you are full of confusion about change, but no winter city has undergone such a rectification before it has the appearance of today's bustling. It doesn't matter if you don't know how to do it, there will be people who will teach you how to make a profit in the transformation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teach...we? "The Count of Delta is swearing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the City Hall official who was trained by the Winter City. They will form a management department that will replace the former lord and take over the jurisdiction of each region. You can choose to join and gain power and status, but the salary input will be greatly limited. You can also look for opportunities to become part of a large production. There is no upper limit to the wealth you receive, and you can't interfere with the decree. On the contrary, you must follow it and complete every task that the city hall confesses. Roland said without hesitation, "No need to worry, this core management system will be established tomorrow. You can make a detailed decision before making a decision, but please remember that no matter which direction you choose, your achievements will be Far more than the value of a piece of land. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
