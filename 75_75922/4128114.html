			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn northeast border, Cage Mountain area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harder it goes, the harder it is. The vines and giant trees are intertwined everywhere. The thick canopy is layered and can only be seen from the gap. A little gray sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that comforts Ajma is that they don’t have to fight against the deep knees of the knees - it’s less affected by the demon moon, and There will be no snow-covered scenes. If they are all like the desolate mountains, they can wait until the spring and summer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean that walking through the mountains is a relaxing activity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When standing down the mountain, the cage mountain is just a gentle high slope, even the steep is not counted. After I really went in, I found that there were no roads in it, and it was not suitable for the big troops to overtake. On the first day of the mountaineering, the pedestrian climbed less than two miles, and three of them were injured. In desperation, the king of the same family, Shaun, had to let the army station in the small town at the foot of the mountain, only picking a few elites to follow her. Forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A local guide, Naf, a goddess of witch Rother, a contact from the Tokat family, Marr, plus her and Sean, etc. It constitutes the whole of this weird exploration team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——No ghosts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of punishment is said to be entrusted by her maid to look after her life. After all, acting with men all the time, there will be many things that are not convenient. But Achima is sure that as long as she tries to escape, the other party will interrupt her legs for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mal. Tokat is a contact person sent by the King of the Morning, but what needs to be contacted in the deep forest? I am not honestly staying in the town, but insisting on going up the mountain together, apparently with purpose. If it is not under the name of Tokat, and it does help a lot along the way, I am afraid that it will have been thrown back by Shaun with a linen bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exploration team is not to mention, this "non-hostile" prospecting team can be armed to the teeth, even the shovel can be used to cut people, facing individual When the lord's knights accompanied, there was a big slap in the face of the other, which was not like a group of ordinary miners at the bottom of their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And none of this group knows what they are looking for, including Ajima - not gold or silver, not copper and iron, the only guide It was this small piece of unidentified coin in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait...and so on," the guide who walked in front suddenly raised his hand and stopped. "Be careful, there are traps here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akima heard a buzzing sound behind her - she knew it was a preparatory movement for the firearm to be shot. For more than a month, Sean had not talked to her about the legendary achievements of her Majesty. She also had a basic understanding of the combat capabilities of this unit. In fact, compared to Rother, who used to be a witch, she found that she prefers to stay with ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rother’s reaction was calm, and she didn’t even pull out the sword, and walked to the guide without hesitation. “Oh? This is... Spears?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Naf pointed to the top of a tree trunk. "See no, spears are hidden there - as long as we don't When you accidentally touch the organ, those things will shoot us into a sieve!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akima looked down at his fingertips, only to see the leaves between the leaves A few sharpened wooden sticks, as if looking down from the heights of cold, as long as they fall on the body, will inevitably hurt the head, neck and other important parts. This is by no means a trap for the hunter, but it is more like a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the agency?" Sean asked quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't find them," Naf shook his head. "Every vine under our feet, every branch may be groping." In part, unless a torch is burned here, it is difficult to completely destroy it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do?" Malt whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only detours, adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said... eh?" Naf looked at the witch in surprise. "Hey, this is not a joke--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he finished, the latter had slowly entered the danger zone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weed is so dense that if you don’t cut it, you can’t see the situation at your feet. Not far from how far, Ajima heard a bang, like something was pulled off, followed by a squeaky rubbing sound on the canopy, like a poisonous snake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know where the strands are stretched straight, and the sticks on the top of the tree pop out! At the same time, Roser also pulled out the sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Complete..." The guide suddenly closed his eyes and seemed unable to bear to watch the woman murder on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Ajima has witnessed everything that follows -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold the hilt with both hands, like a flies, and shoot the roots of the wooden sticks back! Under the impact of the giant force, most of the sticks were broken, but she was able to perform with ease, as if it didn't take much effort at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for the calm, the grass around her is a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This trap is lifted," Rother took the sword back and shrugged at the crowd. "Let's go on the road."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After realizing what happened, Nash was scared to sit on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... I know that you are a great man, and you are very good at it. It’s a big man who came to the king!” After the guide finally recovered from the shock, he immediately changed a set of rhetoric. “Especially this warrior, swordsmanship can be described as supernatural!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to talk nonsense," Rother interrupted. "You better explain why there are such traps in the mountains? Those wooden sticks throw the spears to the beasts, very What is the role of it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the question Ajima wants to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is really used to deal with people," Naf replied honestly. "The more you go to the mountains, the more traps you have, so there are still other cages." A different name, called Trap Mountain - these things are left by the lords of the past, the only purpose is to prevent the wolf heart kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wolf? "Shawn repeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this mountain range extends from the sea to the old holy city. It is the natural boundary between the two countries. Because of the lower terrain, it is like It is surrounded by cages, and the cage mountain is named after it,” Naf explained. “But the problem lies in the shape of the mountain. You should notice it when you are at the foot of the mountain. The south side of the cage is like a gentle slope. It was very high, but it was very easy to go down. This led to the robbers, hunters and refugees in neighboring countries often invading the borders of the morning sun through the cage mountains. At first they only searched the resources in the mountains and then ran into the village to steal and rob. The local leaders were uneasy. The lord also had a headache, so he simply thought of a once-and-for-all solution, that is, to give up the cage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original... ..." Mark Tokat stunned. "There has been such a thing on the border."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Lord of the Lord naturally does not want to attract the attention of the king," Naf went on to say, "Let's say we are again It’s not the poor people on the opposite side. They can’t live without the mountain. We just need to change the living method. After the closure of the mountain, the lord sent people to plant fast-growing weeds and vines, and set up a lot. The trap, this custom has been passed down from generation to generation, and the cage has become what it is today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you turned it into a real cage, although it blocked the other side But they also banned themselves, Ajima thought. If it is Roland Wimbledon, you will not choose to do so. The guy's eyes always looked into the distance, even when she was telling her the task, the focus did not always fall on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, why should you think of him at this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
