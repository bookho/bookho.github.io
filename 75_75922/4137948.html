			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been a long time, and it’s like a short moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan sees his body extending indefinitely toward the dark bottom of the sea until a white spot appears at the end of the field of view, and then the spotlight turns into a radiant light, shrouded her - The next moment, the body touch that seems to be not your own, returned to the consciousness, the roaring sound of water rushed, almost broke her ears, and the quiet moment of the deep sea was shattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt like she was involved in a whirlpool... but quickly rejected the idea that the vortex would only revolve around the center, but here, The rapid flow of water is filled in all directions, and it is their mutual impact that will make such a strong sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Joan is unable to stabilize the figure in this situation, everything loses control. She is like a feather floating in the stormy waves, and can only let these waters sandwich the left and right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she is completely puzzled, she knows that it is not deep in the sea, the scales do not feel too much pressure, and the water depth does not exceed 100 meters at most, which means She will soon surface. In addition, no matter how Joan shouted in his heart, he could no longer get a response from Camilla. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes her eager to get rid of the current predicament, even if she is involuntarily, at least she has to look up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s easier to change the ups and downs than to change direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried her best to rise her head and rose a little in the rushing rapids. Just as she jumped out of the water, Joan’s eyes widened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shadow Islands disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are rocks around and around the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be a vast sea that has turned into a "waterway" that is hundreds of meters long, where the sea quickly flows and bangs. The wind blew above the surface of the water, and it almost made people unable to open their eyes. The sound of their whistling overlapped with the sound of the seabed that they had heard before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head, but she saw a glimmer of light behind her. The water flow rushed to the radiant place, as if it had found a vent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does...has the experience just been repeated again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Joan has been pushing the light by the unstoppable seawater-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roar The sound suddenly quieted down, as if it was far away from her. For a moment, she felt that she was flying, her body became light and fluttering, and there was no real feeling. However, soon she realized that she was indeed in the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foot is her familiar blue sea, but only a few kilometers apart! The surrounding rocks were replaced by the sky. The light she saw came from the sun hanging over the clouds, and the sea that took her out of the cave had turned into a wide waterfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... she is neither a wheat stubble nor a lightning bolt, she will not fly at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought just emerged in my mind, and my body suddenly fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“吖————————吖————————吖————————”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Plop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After experiencing a high-altitude fall of the soul, Joan fell into the head In the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you haven’t seen a similar scene in the Shadows, I’m afraid I’m scared to death here! She swam out of the water and gave her a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it was clearly in the deep sea, why was it suddenly washed into the sky by the water? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Joan looked up and then squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can hardly believe her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a huge incomparable meteorite suspended in midair, so large that it could not be seen at all. The shadow cast by it covers most of the sea, like a cloud that covers the sky. Even some clouds are still under it, which makes it easy for people to create an illusion - it is not an isolated giant, but the top of a mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if it is a desperate mountain, it is no longer majestic in front of it... Joan estimates the thickness of the wall, less than a hundred meters, just like Large islands in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the thick rock wall, there are many cracks, a few hundred meters short, and several kilometers long, they are pouring out The sea water forms a waterfall connecting the two worlds. The injection of such a large amount of water caused a wave of waves to stir up on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it’s a Thunder adult, haven’t you seen such a stunning spectacle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know where I am, there is a point that Joan can be sure, that is, this place must be far from the fjord and the gray fort, otherwise it’s such a big thing. Floating in the sky, it should have been discovered long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I... can I go back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bumpy waves, Joan retracted half of his head into the water and vomited a string of bubbles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Plop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she heard that it was not far away. A falling sound, like something has fallen from above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there other victims who are unfortunately involved? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe estimated the distance, sneaked into the water and swam in that direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about half an hour’s sleep, she finally saw the whole picture of the falling waters - it was an oddly shaped ship, the size and the three The sea boat is quite the same. The lower part seems to be a mixture of the fish body and the squid. The upper part is a frame made up of a curved rib. It is wrapped in flesh and blood like a visceral body. At first glance, it looks like it is eaten half. The body of the animal made her feel sick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that is by no means a dead thing. Shortly after falling into the water, it spreads out four pelvic fins and swung in the direction of the waves. Joan looked at his back and couldn't help but be surprised! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the farther places, there are hundreds of such monsters, which are neatly arranged in rows, half hidden in the waves. Now, its posture is like a huge fleet. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the new arrival of the new arrival, the fleet slowly headed east, until they completely disappeared at the end of the skyline, Joan was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should I do next? Since the monster sea ship is falling from the floating land above the head, there may be other strange enemies nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have never seen such a monster, my intuition tells her not to be close to each other! After awakening to the witch, similar instinct has never been missed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be reluctant, your friend is still waiting for you to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan The words of Ms. Kamila flashed through her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are lightning, wheat, and Luo Jiajie’s voices and smiles appearing in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has never been such a strong idea in my life - she wants to go back to no winter, return to the one who only stayed for one winter, but got to know many partners. local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to go back to everyone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Joan is screaming for himself, and after clarifying the direction, he will swim toward the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
