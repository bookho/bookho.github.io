			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, try to put these two iron plates together," Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna stretched out her finger and pressed it on the seam of the iron plate. The flame is ejected from the fingers and the interface melts at a rate visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reducing firepower, come back again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded and did it all . The two iron plates are spliced ​​at 90 degrees and are firmly welded together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland scrutinized the lower interface and found the effect as he imagined - a perfect weld without any flaws. If it is slightly polished, the fluid traces from the molten iron are worn away, and the two iron plates are almost the same as the once-formed forged body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, Miss Anna, it’s awesome," Roland couldn’t help but admire. "Next, we put the other two iron plates together." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this? An iron-made...bubble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No This is a cylinder," he corrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cylinder?" Anna repeated in confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it can be used to fill the air," Roland pointed to another square iron plate. "Do you see the small hole above? Air from this small The hole enters the cylinder and pushes the piston—呃, which is an iron plate that is slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the cylinder. It can move freely in the cylinder.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is Anna, in the face of so many words, also stunned her head. "Then...the cylinder, the piston, or something, is it for what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manufacture a machine that can move automatically."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steam engine brings the motive force needed for the first industrial revolution of mankind, completely liberating manpower and animal power. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its schematic is familiar to every mechanical dog. Simply put, it is an enlarged version of the kettle. The boiled steam is introduced into the cylinder, pushing the piston and the connecting rod to convert thermal energy into mechanical energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle is exceptionally simple, but it does not mean it is easy to manufacture. Its difficulty lies in the tightness of the cylinder and the piston, as well as the manufacture of the gas pipe. When metal processing is not enough, it is a fantasy to want to punch a qualified cylinder by hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Anna’s ability perfectly compensates for the lack of craftsmanship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland only needs to design four iron plates of the same size in advance, let the blacksmith shop cast and polish, then use the right angle plate to fix the shape, then Anna will weld, A square cylinder with extremely high rigidity can be obtained. With the help of the witch, he does not have to build a cylindrical barrel and then process a circular cylinder like the traditional production process. The same is true for other large components, which can be made into small pieces and then spliced, so that even a small workshop like a blacksmith shop can work together to make all the parts needed for a steam engine. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, before welding was invented, people could only connect small parts by bolts or riveting, and the inside of the cylinder must be smooth, and the conventional connection obviously could not do this. point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only trouble is the gas pipe. Its production method is nothing special, burn a long iron plate to red heat, then put it into the groove mold, hammer it with a hammer and hammer to form, this is also the method of making the front gun barrel . However, the barrel still needs to be straightened afterwards, and the drill line is expanded, which is more complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble is that Roland can't call the blacksmith to his back garden. The witch can't be exposed for a while, and the iron is not his own strength. In desperation, he had to let the chief knight take care of himself and command himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was tossed for three days, Roland finally spelled out the first steam engine in the backyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this your most powerful thing?" Carter frowned at this strange machine, and he first affirmed this stuff with the cult ceremony. Nothing. Every shovel above was fitted by him and looked like a sealed stove. It would be unreasonable if the devil could be attracted to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the eyes of Roland, this seemingly simple machine exudes the beauty of industry. Standing on the shoulders of the giants, he naturally did not take the Newcomen steam engine - the steam engine - to improve the steam engine route. His first prototype was a high-pressure steam engine with double-link and sliding valves. Its production is no more difficult than the most original steam engine, the key lies in some innovative ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will know later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland poured water into the steam room, Let Anna ignite the firewood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes, the water was boiled and the Qianlong curled up. Soon, there was a buzzing sound inside the cylinder, and Roland knew that it was the sound of the cylinder being heated and expanded. The iron plate of the piston is thinner, and the expansion variant is larger than the cylinder, and will eventually firmly adhere to the cylinder wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't this boiling water? I didn't expect it to be a stove," Carter muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the cylinder was filled with steam, Roland was excited to appear. The piston begins to push the link outward. When moving to the apex, the other link pulls the sliding valve, which in turn pushes the piston inward. The two connecting rods rotate with the wheels one by one, and as the firepower increases, the speed reaches a peak quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The machine makes a harsh roar, the exhaust snoring and vomiting white air, there is an unstoppable momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what you said...the power hidden in nature?" Anna asked dumbly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief knight is incredibly unbelievable. The last big iron wheel was installed with great effort. Now it is spinning like a feather, standing Beside it, you can even feel the airflow from the wheels – this only shows that the strength of this shovel is so big that it is amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s heart is gradually rising a little uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highness says it can replace manpower and animal power. If it is not to lie to yourself, when it replaces the horse to pull the chariot, it is only because of this brute force. Knights are hard to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To train a qualified knight, it takes fifteen years to build one such iron stove, but only three days. It took only a week to count the time the blacksmith built the parts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not need to be fed, not afraid of cold and hunger, nor afraid of arrows and knives. As long as the front corner is fitted with a corner, it can slam on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way... Is it necessary for a traditional knight to exist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At night, when Roland returned to the bedroom, he saw the nightingale again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t wear a hood this time, sitting at the table with a smile on her face, playing with a few pieces of parchment in her hand, “It seems that the outside rumors really can’t Believe. It is said that the four princes don't learn nothing, and their character is bad. In fact, they don't give much to the court master. This paper is the design of the iron stove. You call it a steam engine, right? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going, can you leave some privacy, if you want to come, you want to leave, you think this is your home! Roland’s heart was awkward, and he still replied with nothing on his face. “It’s a design, but without Anna’s help, it’s just a drawing.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “What can it do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Many, mining, drainage, iron, forging, wherever it takes a lot of effort, it can make a difference ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I took it," the nightingale rolled up the parchment and put it in the robes. "There are people who can control the flames in the club." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved her hand to stop Roland’s protests, "Of course, I am not taking your things in white, you should look at this first." She put a small group of white things on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland walked over and pinched it with his fingers and found that it was actually a roll of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
