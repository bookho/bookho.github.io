			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks later, when the midsummer month was coming to an end, Roland finally arrived at Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North garrison and the witches greeted him at the gate of the Holy City. In addition, he saw a little wearing a church-style black robe in the ranks. Nun. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Roland has learned from the lightning that the church’s high-level collective disappeared, but when he walked into the empty plateau fortress, he still couldn’t believe it. - The anticipation of the fierce battle did not happen, whether it was a godly witch or a new mortar, it did not come in handy. Although this result is no better, there is always a feeling of punching on cotton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to bring Isabella before the expedition is a very correct choice. According to the report from Eagle Face and Ai Gesha, it is this predecessor. I noticed the abnormality of the church and, after properly disposing of the orphans in the monastery, proposed to the Northern Army to go deep into the investigation of the holy city of Hermes. The results were astonishing, and the big cities had already gone to the sky, leaving only the residents in the outer city who had no time to move to maintain the illusion that the church still exists. In fact, they are not clear about what happened in the inner city, only to hear that the church is preparing for the final battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuns who were unified by Isabella soon entered Hermes - and under the circumstance of these people, the signs of escape gradually eased At least, the fugitive battalion in the direction of the wolf heart and the winter is no longer appearing. After all, the abandonment of the holy city is simply too dramatic, and the blow to the church's reputation is almost devastating. Compared with those who leave without saying goodbye, the nun who took the initiative to restore order is more like a successor to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did this happen?" Because the letter could not be written in too much detail, the first thing after Roland entered the Holy City was to ask the church. The whereabouts of the remnant forces, "There are thousands of people in the inner city. Do you need to go through the outer walls without leaving the plateau?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hermes below There are many natural tunnels, some of which can pass through the holy city walls from the ground. If they are evacuated in batches, they can really make the residents of the outer city unconscious.” Isabella explained, “They were under construction. It was designed to be used once and only went out, and I checked several tunnel entrances and found that they were all destroyed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those Where is the authentic road?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the people who have passed know," she shook her head. "If the escape is planned in advance, one and a half months later. It’s hard to track down where they are going.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the church is going End of life insurance in an attempt to comeback? Roland can't help but frown. The problem is that giving up the holy city is equivalent to losing the basic disk, not as simple as cutting the tail, and its losses are even worse than broken. They are so confident that they can rediscover a base against the Grey Fortress? Still intending to turn it into zero, harassing his territory in batches? He felt a headache when he thought about the group of fanatics in the next few years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably seeing his thoughts, Isabella smiled. "You don't have to worry about the church anymore, they won't come back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned, "Why do you say that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They left a messenger." Answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small church in the northern part of the Holy City, Roland saw Isabel Pull the messenger in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a white-haired old man wearing a brand new red gilt priest’s robe, holding a thick book in his arms, under the guard’s Got out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his steps are somewhat vain, he still looks up, as if he does not want to lose to anyone in the momentum. He first glanced at Isabella coldly, and then looked at Roland. "You are the king of the Grey Fort, Roland Wimbledon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s gray and gray, it’s really like your father,” the old man said slowly. “My name is Jacob, St. The high priest of the city, if according to the secular division, is probably equal to the Duke... Of course, I have neither the corresponding fiefdom nor so many servants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
