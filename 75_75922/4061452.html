			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No-!" Pasha shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw that Celine pulled the tentacles from the sacred instrument and knocked down the two mixed species, and they were bitten by other evil beasts. There were a few gaps in the sarcomatous body, and the scales and gray body fluids were everywhere. There are a few flexible wolf-shaped aliens that even climbed up the top of her head with her rough skin, trying to bite the top of the main whisker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other witches have rescued their swords. The first one to arrive is Elena. Her figure is like a silver light. Two paragraphs, then rushed into the evil beasts to kill the Quartet, wherever the blue blood splashed - the monsters that make the mortal fearful are no more than an ordinary beast in the face of the warrior who is not inferior to the extraordinary It’s better to go where. In the early stage of physical exertion, they are both inferior in strength and speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As more and more witches joined the battle, the evil beasts were killed one by one, and the short chaos finally subsided. Pasha took back all the tentacles and rushed to the center of the hall, mentioning the eyes of the blind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differently different witches who can change their bodies at will, they can't replace a new sarcoma when they enter the sarcoma. Once the body is dying, they can only choose Blended with Eleanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Pasha himself, would not mind such an ending - since she decided to follow Nataya, she has already prepared for sacrifice. But Celine can't. Only the survivors have the deepest research on the core of the magic. Once they are integrated, they will not be able to start the instrument again for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you okay?" Dropped down to the scarred sarcoma, Pasha asked nervously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh...the problem is not big," Celine’s reply made her relieved. "Just plug the holes in the body, but it’s a tentacles." I was bitten off and killed me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will be content, you can experience pain... I can’t wait to relive the pain. "One person shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, if Felice hears this, she must be envious of her death, but unfortunately she can only get it mentally."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say that she is also going to serve mortals for Taqila," Elena frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She should call the 76th now? I don't know how the planners are going to perform."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long has it been? It is no longer the time for the federation to rule the whole world. It is not easy to contact the witches who are hiding in Tibet. We have to insist on at least two to three years. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or insist that the red moon will come and be swallowed up by the devil army." Some added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hell, do you have to say it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has caused a burst of time Laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s all over, we’re not out of the woods yet," said Elsie. "What to do now, there’s a break in the head, there’s a first Only when we fall down will there be a second one. Can we keep a group of people under the hole?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa thought for a moment and denied the proposal," No, if the falling evil beasts are specifically fighting with the left-behind witches, what if they turn their heads and attack the periphery? Then those who defend the various entrances will fall into the danger of being attacked by the enemy, even if they have the power of the gods. It is still dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with Pasha’s statement," Elena nodded. "And by the time everyone is easily surrounded by divisions, even the retreat There is no such thing. Instead of fighting separately, it is better to concentrate on one point. Guarding the relics and core around the center of the main hall, we can all survive as long as Celin repairs the sacred instruments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am also. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "No matter how evil beast better than being killed from behind good." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
