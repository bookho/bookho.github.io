			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Duke, the front is the town of Fengshuang."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Knights report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien.Pike lifts the lookout and observes the movements in the town - this place is located at the southwest junction of Yongdong and Langxin, surrounded by hillsides, standing At any high point, the situation of the town can be seen clearly. Because the terrain is easy to attack and defend, it has not been expanded into a castle for centuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This town has a lot on the border of the two kingdoms, and there is nothing special about it. If it is usually, Ma Weien will not look at it twice. But now, it has a unique meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any news for the person who went to inquire about the information?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Asked, only I spent a few silver wolves, and all the townspeople said it." The Cavaliers proudly said, "There is indeed a team of gray-great people in the activity, the number is small, it is forty or fifty people, almost every other time. Appears once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are they not stationed here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After crossing the border It’s all mountain roads, and I heard that there are always wild wolves, and no one escorts, those refugees are afraid that one can’t get through.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien’s heart suddenly has a bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spread of red fog is not based on the border, but it is like an expanding semicircle, which makes the red fog at the farthest has crossed the area of ​​the Wolfheart City. And the most recent is still in the winter. Compared to going to neighboring countries, it is clear that fighting inside the kingdom makes him more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Fengshuang Town not only meets this requirement, but also because of the remote location, those who are stunned by the Grey Fortress rarely enter the wolf heart from here. Compared to several big cities with convenient transportation, Fengshuang Town is almost as unobtrusive as mosquito legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien wants exactly fewer people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less of people means that the Grey Fort will not pay too much attention to this place, and the information heard by the spy will undoubtedly confirm this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As old scholars have said, those hard bones have their own devils to deal with, and what he has to do is to be in the vulnerability of the other. Take a bite. As long as this kind of thing is passed on, regardless of whether the result is big or small, the other party can let the other party vote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the old scholar’s ​​strategy is not only that, but there are more hot tricks waiting for the Grey Fortress, if it succeeds, then two Three times, he believes that the other party's plunder will be greatly frustrated, and the Lord of Heaven may also rely on him more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back, let's talk to everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spent half a day rushing back to the nearest town, Ma Weien went into the house of the original lord with great enthusiasm. Originally belonged to an unnamed baron, but the red fog and devil rumors that were approached not long ago were scared to escape, but it saved a lot of negotiation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This land is still not his own. After all, his real power is temporarily limited to the four cities in the North, but Ma Weien believes that the expansion of the Parker family will never until. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, a bunch of nobles he gathered together gathered for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke looked around and silently remembered everyone’s face and look. There are forty-five applicants in the room. Most of them are knights and there are several barons, and the highest identity is the lord of the original North Port, Viscount Nanor. These people were either forced to lose their own territory, or they were taken away by the Grey Fortress. Under the promise of the Fengdi Prize, they did not hesitate to rely on his majesty, if they counted their own bodyguards, Thanks to the confession and enthusiasm, the number of available combat troops in this team has reached more than three hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being unintentional, the number of people is dominant, this is obviously an excellent opportunity. More critically, they did not have a weapon gap with their opponents for the first time. In the past, the nobility of the aristocrats in the past was unrelenting. It was because the firearms of the Grey Fortress were fierce, and their speed and distance were far from those of their imitation snow powder weapons. If there is no such support from the Scorpio Lord, let alone 300 people, even if it is doubled again, no nobles will be willing to assist him to fight with the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
