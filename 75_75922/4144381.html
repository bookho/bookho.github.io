			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past six months, Victor Lothar has been staying in the South, but he is extremely concerned about the absence of the Winter City - in his eyes, this The city will undoubtedly be the center of the future, not just the Grey Fort, but also for the other three kingdoms and the fjords. Since the release of the "Graycast Weekly", he has ordered his men to buy it in the first place and send it to the clear water port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s time to go back to no winter, it’s also for two big things to see in the newspapers – one is the sale of the Miracle Building, and the other is the new devil’s The premiere of The Dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t quite understand why King of the Grey Fort is so concerned about belonging, such as obtaining a resident ID before buying a house, and having an ID card means No winter people. The problem is that this ID card does not restrict his stay, whether it is staying at the clear water port or returning to Huiguang City, there is no limit. In this case, what is the significance of the formal residents who do not have winter city to his businessman who is running around? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in any case, as long as you can participate in the purchase - the tallest building in the entire mainland, or in the heart of the new kingdom, any place to come here People, will not miss this scene. Nothing is more suitable than this as a signboard to promote "Rainbow Stone". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, even if he missed the Miracle Building, he would not feel too sorry. After all, as the first new cotton merchant who cooperated with Roland, he is already in the industry. The middle station is full of opportunities. For Victor, the second thing is far more important than the first one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will never forget the feeling of watching the Shadows for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is definitely a deep soul-like shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, as the curtain opens, the flesh is no longer there, leaving only the soul to swim in the incredible world. "Wolf Heart" he repeatedly watched several times. If he did not decide to go to the south to grow cotton, he even wanted to buy a movie ticket for each performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Shadow "The Dust of the Dust", although it can't be guessed from the title, but the original star of the Star Flower Troupe, and The script written by the master of the drama, Kajin Fez, is enough to attract his attention. In addition, in the introduction, the story was also based on real events, and was assisted by Roland Wimbledon, all unknown in the play. Secrets come from the royal collection! It is important to know that these insider information is often impossible to inform the civilians. The rumors circulating in the market or in the pub are too far off the mark, and it is impossible to pass the time to chat and pass the time. Now there is a chance to really see the tip of the secret, or through the way of the shadow, no matter which part of the script is unveiled, Shantou has been said to be full of weight, how can he miss such an opportunity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the main reason why Victor made a special trip to the Winter City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at the Executive Office, Linglong was busy, from applying for business to picking up the queue, and soon helped him to do everything. The first fare of the Shadows has risen to 50 Golden Dragons, which is 10 more than the "Wolf", but he still did not hesitate to place a hundred Golden Dragons and purchased two tickets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene not only makes the exquisite mind sway, but also caused others to look at it, after all, such an expensive premiere ticket, even foreign businessmen have to think twice. You must know that even if it is the second game the next day, the price will be much lower, not to mention the civilian ticket of more than ten silver wolves sold after one week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a lot of trouble to buy a house in the Miracle Building. After applying, he and Linglong were invited into a separate hut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have a winter city ID card?" Until then, the maid was depressed and surprised. "But you are not a gray castle, nor are you Residents of Bianbu Town..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor shrugged. "You seem to have forgotten that you can get a formal resident status without winter when you buy a home. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly know!" exquisitely protested. "You can usually live in a pub..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no conflict between the two," he said in an understatement. "I prefer lively occasions compared to residential areas, but that doesn't prevent me from buying a property for the occasional Need."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
