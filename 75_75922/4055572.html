			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across a mountain road guarded by numerous guards, red brick wall in the snow The forest was exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see from the sentry post along the way, if you act alone on the 76th, you will certainly not be allowed to enter such a forbidden place - the high-level witch finally owns With the matching treatment, at least the mortal guard of this scale will not humiliate the name of the promoter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she doesn’t quite understand why this genius figure wants to build his home between the hillsides of the North Slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to Wendy’s statement, she still maintains a suspicious attitude, in any case, a high-level witch who has been awakened twice in adulthood, It sounds too unbelievable. Although the number of awakenings does not represent the strength of the ability, the perseverance, intelligence, and sentiment requirements required for awakening twice are unbelievable. There are no such figures in the entire federation. I did not expect that she would be in a mortal. I met one in the country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the getting closer to the wall, the 76th found something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this really the residence of the witch? Crossing the top of the wall, she could only see the top cover of several canvases, not to mention the castle or the stone tower, and even a layer of bungalows disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are here," Wendy knocked on the wall of the courtyard. "The back slope of Beipo Mountain is the place for the development of various types of machinery and equipment in the winter city. Outside of time, Anna usually stays here to work. In order to ensure her safety, her majesty blocks the entire mountain road and prohibits unrelated personnel from entering and leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A research institute... on the 76th, frowning in the dark, and the guards on the road are not owned by Anna, but sent by the king? It is protection, I am afraid there is also the meaning of surveillance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wynti Sister," is a lively little girl who opened the door. "I have been waiting for you for a long time!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what about your sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am doing machine testing with Anna Sister."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Amy asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lucia's sister, Bell White," Wendy said. "She is now a reserve clerk in the league and has not yet awakened to a witch."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello," the little girl’s well-behaved manner, "Please come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lucia White is also a frequent visitor to this place. She and Anna worked together on metal materials. Wendy led everyone into the hospital. "By the way, her ability has evolved in adulthood, and magic. The degree of increase is second only to Anna. It is one of the few witches in the league who can cast a sacred seal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventy-sixth to hear this sentence Did not be picked up by the threshold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, what she was just saying -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our good soon someone asked, "What is the seal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Print," Wendy repeated with a smile. "A weapon that requires a huge amount of magic to display. It is difficult for ordinary people to light up the four magic stones above, so Roland hangs it in the castle hall. If you use magic, you can experience it yourself in the future. Only four people in the league can light up the last magic stone, and everyone is guessing who will be the fifth." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hanging in the hall? Only four people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventy-sixth feels like listening to a fantasy - not to mention where they got the sacred prints, just listen again It is enough to be surprised by this name. In the era of Tacila, it was the exclusive weapon of the three seats of the Federation! Except that every moment is equivalent to the superb training, others can't provide the magic power of the golden thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
