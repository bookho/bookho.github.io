			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last statistic was handed over to Barov, the head of the general manager gave a sigh of relief and waved to his subordinates. "Go on." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter bowed his head with respect and bowed, and when he left, he closed the office door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a veteran in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the drawer, took out more than ten forms from it, spread it on the table, and then stacked the latest one, and it was neatly flat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, all the materials needed for the battle are all available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balof gently rubbing these papers is like stroking the girl’s tender and smooth skin, the rows of numbers on the top look like ordinary people’s passwords In his eyes, it is a wonderful movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one and a half weeks, no winter city completed a large-scale logistics move, no matter whether it was food or Jinlong, it exceeded any previous one. Through the plan and the statistics, he can see a boat and wheat heading northward along the river, and can hear the pleasant sound of the colliding Jinlong colliding with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling made him intoxicated and difficult to extricate himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to give a name to the movement, there is no doubt that only "power" is the most appropriate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, this power lies in his hands, let him play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After three years of accumulation, the strength of no winter city has reached an incredible level - not just the army, but all aspects . When he was the assistant to the finance minister of the old king, he had a certain understanding of the financial situation of the gray towns. It was because of this that he understood how amazing the achievements of Roland Wimbledon were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resources that flow into the city without winter are probably equal to the other cities in the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately no one can share this joy with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barov took the single-sided glasses and glanced at the empty table opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who can understand these numbers and experience the comfort, from the city hall, it is estimated that there is only one North Pearl. Sometimes he can often feel that the other person is the same person as him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this regret disappears in a blink of an eye, and nothing can't be left behind in terms of exclusive power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up, went to the window, and found a strange coin from his arms, spread out in the palm of his hand. In the late spring sun, the "mountain" pattern engraved on the surface of the coin sparkles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the emblem of the Communist Youth League found in the Forest of the West in three years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He secretly kept it, originally thinking of when the church entered the West, as the lord colluded with evidence of the witch in exchange for their own security. But now, this emblem has become his lucky charm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorrow of the witch is evil? Of course not, the evil is the guys who are knocked down by the squats - they have no power, but they hold the high position, this is the biggest crime. Even the devils in the wilderness are not as awkward as they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this situation will not last long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his plan to finally decide on the advanced attack will make him look forward to the late arrival, but he has waited for more than 20 years, wait for another What about the year? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort should be handed over to more capable people to manage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the next kingdom is crowned, the day when the king is king, he will also climb to the top of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today's test is here first, your luggage is packed. "Ai Gesha asked while arranging the experimental materials, "Tomorrow is the day of departure, don't drop things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't have extra clothes There are no items to carry." Isabella shook her head and replied calmly. The life without winter city is simpler than she imagined. Except for repeatedly performing the ability to make the ice witch observe the record, the rest of the time can be controlled by her, as long as she does not leave the diplomatic building. There is no harassment or humiliation. The relationship between the witches is very different from that of the pure ones. Sometimes she even thinks that Ai Gesha’s attitude towards her is almost the same as that of other witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," she added after she said, "The last thing...Thank you for telling me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean the news of the church?" Aegusa shrugged. "If it is me, I will think about going back and seeing it, whether it is a farewell or a break. But now Don't say those, you can't do it on the way... It's my negligence, I didn't find it, you always wear the same set of clothes." She put down the record book, frowned and went to Isabella, grabbed the sleeve and touched it. "It's all white, and it's still winter. Wait until the weather turns hot. Are you going to suffocate inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's nothing." Sabella wanted to say that she had undergone more severe training, but after thinking about it, she swallowed the second half of her sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a matter of one or two months. I don’t want to say that there is a condition for you to clean your clothes every day. It’s just that your companions can’t stand it. "Ai Gesha decided indiscriminately. "Without the time, I will take you to the convenience market and pick a few pieces of fitted clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The companion in the other party gave her a slight glimpse and said that she was silent for a moment. "But... I don't have money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a redeemed person, naturally I don't get a salary every month like the members of the Witch Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have it," Ai Ge Shaman doesn't care. "When I borrow yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"But I have to be five years later..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s been a short time compared to Tacera’s hundreds of years of waiting, "Isn't it?" The ice witch interrupted. "The war of the future will not be so easy to end. You will not always be like this unless you want it." She said that she extended her hand. "So you What are you hesitating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabella did not answer, she suddenly felt that the sunset coming in from the window was a bit dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the golden afterglow, Aegusa’s figure gradually disappeared, leaving only the hand that was handed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bowed her head and held the other's palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, the sun seemed to be with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I am following you, really don't matter?" Anna lay in Roland's arms and asked with the blue eyes of the lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while he was busy setting up the punishment of the witch, the world of two people like this has not been enjoyed for a long time. Because of this, after a long night, the two still whispered, and seemed to want to make up for what they had owed before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s been prepared for so long, it doesn’t matter if you take a break," Roland stroked her smooth back. "Moreover, this trip is not all about fighting." Publicity is also very important – for example, if you are familiar with everything in front of everyone, it is not good to have a good woman to accompany you at the party.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Anne gently sighed, embarrassed to bury her head, through the bright moonlight, Roland saw a touch of red on her cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her intelligence, she clearly understands the meaning of this statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
