			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the letter is written in the letter of the ethnic group, but it seems to be twisted separately, as if it was deliberately imitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you look closely, you will find its uniqueness - whether it is word formation or sentence, it has a distinctive ancient style, absolutely A language that is not common in the current ethnic group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod actually produced a familiar familiarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sinking into a half-hearted memory, a sense of surprise and tremor suddenly came to my heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did this letter come from?" The owner of the Scorpio grabbed Ma Weien and asked loudly. The excitement of emotions made it forgotten to maintain a high attitude in front of human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien was scared and stumbled after a while. "Big, adults, I am not too sure... the person who sent the letter is now On the miracle, I, I will ask him to come over to see you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go!" Heckzod glared at his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t dare to raise his hand to wipe the saliva, Ma Weien almost ran to the human gathering place with his hands and feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod knows that he is doing something wrong, but it can’t control his own mood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writing is clearly belonging to the nightmare tyrant Wakiris! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the level of the copywriter is so poor that it didn’t detect the owner of the letter for the first time, just look at it a few times, it’s I will never admit my mistakes - it is a sentence from the enlightenment of the ethnic enlightenment more than a thousand years ago, with a little human narrative style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-ranking promoters who can live from the first battle of the gods to the present are just a handful, but they will be integrated into the human tone, except for those who have been in the cloud. There is no second possibility beyond the long-awaited nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakirith... still retains his consciousness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been in the conscious world for several months now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is considered an unbelievable thing, then what is even more incredible is the content of the letter-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The battle of God is a scam of repeated reincarnation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conscious world is at the bottom of the mainland spine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of God is not safe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few short sentences, it contained such a huge amount of information that Heckzod was in a state of sorrow. There are too many questions pouring into my mind, but none of them can be answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did Wakiris stay conscious in the turbulent magic sea? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does it pass the message out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this letter from Wakiris’s will? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should you report to the king? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Scorpio...the one you want, I brought..." Just as Heckzod’s hair was coming, Ma Weien’s cautious voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned and swept the two people coldly. "About the origin of the letter, I want to know all, let us know what you know."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the detailed experience, Heikezod has understood that it is impossible to trace the source of the letter from human beings - this is an amazing The secret letter was actually handed over to the nobility by a migrant, and the migrant was only responsible for the "message" for a few golden dragons, and did not think about the meaning of the letter itself. Even if you follow up, there will be no result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is nothing wrong with you here." Heikezod waved his hand. "Do not take the initiative to disclose to anyone. If there is such a letter in the future, you must hand it to me in the first place. Do you understand?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we must do it!" The two nobles rushed to salute, saying that they must not be burdened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the humans were sent away, the Lord of Heaven and Earth looked at the North and fell into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, it found that he was unexpectedly relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the day of the lost dream of the monarch, the pressure that has been pressing on its shoulder has quietly reduced by a few points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably, no one can ignore the influence of the other party in the community...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the actual situation, or psychologically, Heckzod is more inclined to write this letter is Wakiris. Personal style is extremely difficult to imitate, even if humans master the text of the ethnic group, it is impossible to forge such a letter. As for why it is not a nightmare, the only explanation is that it is still trapped in the conscious world and can only transmit information through human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for choosing humans is not so difficult to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why it will never go back is because it wants to crack the secrets of human inheritance, and the tracking target is also the inheritance fragment of human beings. Considering that it is very likely that witches will also have outstanding people who can touch the conscious world, then this clue will be logical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hykzod wants to think that his guess is correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the biggest question at the moment is... Was Kiris convinced the witch, made her part of the plan, or was forced into the enemy , the letter that was written unwillingly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, it does not believe that the monarch will give in to humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ideology is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating on the sea of ​​magic, and always being attacked by other consciousness, it is very difficult to stay awake, if this is smashed, the result will be How is it not to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the two is far from perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the latter case, it is at best a trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the former, does it mean that the ethnic group is on the wrong path? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one who dominates this is not the other, it is the king of the group...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the nightmare Will you choose to give the letter to yourself, not the creator of God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod couldn’t help but shudder, forcing his thoughts and forbidding himself to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the door of twisting, and the Lord of Heaven will climb to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natural barrier of the human kingdom, the "desperate mountain range", has appeared on the edge of the continent as a gray line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to a week, the war will start again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of God under the feet is like a huge fortress, moving steadily toward the battlefield - there is nothing in the fire and fire In the case, it is difficult to imagine how humans should resist, in order to block the pace of ethnic conquest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a must-have war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kawajilis believes that God is not safe...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If The remark that the gods are scams is too far away, so the warning of this point is close at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not willing to believe that the enemy can pose a threat to such a magnificent magic creation, but in retrospect, all the failures of the past are based on "no May be above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
