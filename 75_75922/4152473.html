			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the Shenchiwan defenders rushed out of the encirclement before the devil collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the 80% of the kingdom of the Wolfheart Kingdom fell into the hands of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army was concentrated in the west and the central pass of the cage, which is the only two natural passage between the wolf heart and the morning sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, the first main line of the north-south artery was finally penetrated, and the cement road extending from both sides was integrated in the middle of the cage mountain, which means There is no special road to the wolf heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first "Hump" team slowly appeared at the end of the horizon, there was a burst of exclamation in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that? It’s just like a hill!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With wheels, I think it should Count the car..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are even shells that are cast iron, how much it costs..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you change to Malayan, I am afraid that ten can't pull it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;哼, the guy who didn't know. Sweeping around the conversation, and White's disdainful expression, this can make a big fuss. If you let the iron birds fly in the air, it is estimated that the eyes will be scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is naturally not here to celebrate the opening of the roads of the Grey Fort, but like most drivers, in order to receive a good commission - since the wolf After encountering the devil in the heart, he never dared to step into the territory outside the control area of ​​the Grey Fort. After all, the Iron Bird rescued this kind of thing and it was blessed by the gods. He didn’t think he was lucky. Every time, the gray castle people happened to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logistics transport team organized by the refugees spontaneously inspired White, although the income was not as good as the transport personnel, but it was safer, not to mention his horse was thin and the car was worn out. It is also stronger than the refugees' trolleys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s obvious that this is more than just one person. With the approach of the devil and the evacuation of the urban residents, many drivers have turned to the rear like him. The formation of the team has suddenly grown a lot, and it has fainted the trend of the industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he thought of this, White was a bit embarrassed, obviously he came first, but he had to grab the young guys. If the clever ghost is here, it is estimated that you have already drawn up your own transportation team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, those giants have been driving in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they look heavy and clumsy, they are not much slower than a carriage. Especially when its body is fully displayed, even if it is a self-seeing white, it feels the pressure from the face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without him, these vehicles are really too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is a wheel that is half a person high, the width is thicker than the body, and the outer edge of the steel wheel is covered with a layer of dark gelatinous material, pressed on the road. Kind of unspeakable stability. Looking back at the carriage that he had originally regarded as a treasure, White even gave birth to a sense of self-defeating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the glass window that penetrates through the front of the car, it is more obvious when you look down at your own "driver" with a condescending look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White couldn’t help but think, if you use it to pull a shipment, how many times can you pull your own carriage? How to say it has been ten times, according to the way the gray castle people are pricing, that is ten times the income...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They issued the commission! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know who swears, people suddenly stop talking and rush to the camp. Although these unprecedented wheeled vehicles have much higher carrying capacity than carriages and carts, they have to rely on them to deliver the goods to various camps and mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can have such a steel wheeler, how good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina pulled up the handbrake and jumped out of the cockpit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not expect that she would eventually return to the wolf in such a way - although she made up her mind, she was a member of the church after all, even through screening The Executive Office will not necessarily allow her to go to the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no one has reminded that Farina has been a sinner, and the driver’s route is based on results. It took her only a week to master the driving skills of the steam truck. The final test was also a perfect score. When she proposed to take the transportation route from the windward to the flash river, the responsible official promised on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not the first time to pass this level, although the surrounding scenery is still similar to the impression in memory, but the overall appearance is very different - more near the level Many temporary houses and tents, dark hard roads can be seen everywhere, roadblocks, sentry towers and barbed wire divide the camp into several distinct areas, no matter which camp area can see many people busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you don’t ask, you can feel the smell of war in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This taste is so familiar to Farina that she is slightly disoriented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Joe's voice interrupted her flustered thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, nothing," Farina shook her head. "I think I have got the answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the trial army, her feelings about the power of the gray castle can be described as deeper than most people. If the opponent is only a nobleman, the first army does not have to make such a battle. If all of this is an illusion created to deceive her, it would be too high to look at myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the legendary devil can make Roland all right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then we are next..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First help the King of Graysburg win "Farina hung her eyes. "This is the beginning of my atonement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will accompany you to the end." Joe gently held her Hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is Farina and Joe in the second car group?" The sound that suddenly sounded behind him interrupted the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, is there anything?" Farina coughed twice and turned back to some guilty conscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer of the officer’s appearance was first erected, and then said, “The Chief of the First Army, the Axe, wants to see all the “Hump” drivers. On the one hand, he is now in the Cangshan Command, please go with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team members have been told during the training, the logistics also Part of military operations, they should give priority to military deployments compared to scheduled delivery plans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina and Joe looked at each other and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering the Cangshan Command and seeing the first sight of everyone present, Linna found that the meeting might not be that simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least not a simple condolence and welcome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the woman standing in the middle of the crowd has a beautiful gray hair, and that is the symbol of the blood of the royal family of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After someone came out to introduce it, she confirmed her judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highness Princess Tilly, First Army Chief Commander Axe, Artillery Battalion Commander Fanner, Firearms Battalion Commander Brian, Witch Alliance Operations Command Ai Gesha, it can be said that all the top officials of the entire front line have gathered in this hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
