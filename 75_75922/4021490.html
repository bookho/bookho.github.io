			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At night, Wendy called all the witches into her bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original spacious room was full of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of scene seems to have met before, just a year ago, she also gathered the sisters here, told them the situation of the town, and comforted their uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, there were only seven sisters who fled the wilderness. They lost their souls and were full of confusion and fear of the road ahead. Many of them even came to this border town with the idea of ​​"already enough, and no matter what kind of fate they face." Survival is a difficult thing for them, not to mention the church that is shrouded in the top of the witch like a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, everyone’s look is very different from a year ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only survive, free and comfortable life has gradually become the consensus of the sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No oppression and hostility from others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to worry about food and safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has become the "sacred mountain" of the witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as they can help Roland to defeat the church, all nightmares will dissipate, and the witch will usher in true liberation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone looked at Wendy, she said, "The church is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daytime meeting was not much about intelligence. She quickly finished the content on the secret letter, and there was a brief silence in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you...will you win?" After a moment, the mystery moon whispered, "I can stay at the factory all day to generate electricity for him... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get it, then he has to send someone to take care of you," Lily grinned disdainfully. "Do not bother him at this time." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches made a sneer, with the first For those who are open, the sound behind them is much more natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will also redouble my efforts to produce white wine," Evelyn clenched her fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But can't you use so many bars with the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诶...is like this "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't think that you will lose, even if it is an extraordinary witch ashes, isn't it also hit by Carter?" The hummingbird bluntly said, "God The penalty is not as bad as the ashes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really? Even the uninviting ashes have been lost?" Surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't lose, Carter is stunned, and the ash is unable to move. I think it is a tie."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, this is an unfair test," Ai Gesha retorted. "The extraordinary person will only be stronger if he uses the same weapon."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is only one superb person on the island, but there are thousands of soldiers with guns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait, the direction of your argument is wrong," the book shook his head helplessly. "Now it is the church and Roland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wendy’s heart was a little relieved. Although everyone is worried, there is no one who is afraid to fight with the church. This was absolutely unthinkable a year ago. After all, the enemy’s power is like a mountain. The witches who dare to fight against it will not survive. Huidong hides in Tibet, and only to the desperate mountains of the inaccessible can get rid of their pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this change in mentality has a lot to do with the fact that the foreign war has never failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone suddenly closed their mouths, but there was an inexplicable glow in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole kingdom...even the entire continent, can make the witch live a stable life, and in the territory of Roland, we can also create new with ordinary people. The world, enjoying the same honor and status - this is what he often hangs on, I just didn't expect it to come so fast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wentington Dunton, "But according to the habits of the past, we don't have to work too hard, or work as usual. If we have this confidence, we will not fail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't know too much, the ability and knowledge is not the most outstanding one in the league, and she is responsible for giving the witch alliance to her. She can only do this - before the expedition, She always delivered an impassioned speech in front of the First Army. She couldn’t think of any inspiring way. She could only tell the words from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mind for others is more important than anything else", she firmly remembers the sentence of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is our home and a turning point in changing the fate of the witch. I am willing to give it everything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy finished speaking, he extended his left hand and his back was up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first book was pressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then is the nightingale and Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Roland and No Winter City!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is surrounded by a group Stacking the back of the hand, the bloody witch will hesitate for a while, and it seems that I don't know if it will be accepted by everyone until the leaves pull them into the circle - they are truly integrated into the group with the direct contact of the palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really don't want to deal with such a nuisance guy before the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Aegis, although he said this, still extended his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Wendy put his right hand on everyone's hand and looked around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the Witch Alliance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the eternal sacred mountain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone left, there was only her and the nightingale in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty closes the door and suddenly feels a cool breeze behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and saw that the nightingale didn’t know when she opened the window, sitting on the window sill and looking at the night sky, the evening wind brought her curly hair and floated There is also a faint fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you worried about this war?" Wendy walked to the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Worry?" The nightingale turned too far, and the scorpion shone with a burning glow in the glow of the magic stone. "I am afraid that I will laugh out loud." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Laugh...out of the voice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time she only noticed the other person's body The sharpness of the overflowing - it is difficult for someone to do the same as the nightingale, and let the magic out of the game without using the ability. And they are no longer elusive things, but they are like a blade, forming an inaccessible area, as if the foggy world is eroding the surrounding space a little bit, beginning to gradually affect the world. Since coming to Bianbu Town, this feeling has become more and more obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the enemy, this is also a dangerous sign. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can wait for a long time to revenge the church." The nightingale slowly said, "The sisters who are dying in the hands of the church must also look forward to it." The arrival of this day - I have tasted the feeling of revenge, which is unforgettable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
