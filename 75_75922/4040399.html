			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch, Roland called Barov into the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general manager is still the first time to come to this place, his hands and feet are obviously more cautious than in the past, his face is very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing each other’s performance, Roland couldn’t help but remember the story of a celebrity in history who ran out of the way to receive visiting officials, which made the latter very moved. . Obviously, it is just a lazy behavior, but the boss always feels a strong trust, which is also unintentional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that male officials still have unique advantages in promoting loyalty, such as holding a candlelight night, sleeping and slumbering... If you change to Iraq The words of Tish Kant are probably another idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head with a smile and put away these distractions. "How many letters did you receive during the time when I was fighting and coma in the North? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A total of 16 seals," Barov quickly reported. "Most of them are letters from local lords requesting trade or visits, and two more." It is the secret letter that Dongjing guardian expresses to you in peace talks. I have responded one by one according to your previous requirements."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the tasks confessed by the pre-war conference, When the king led the army, no winter city was temporarily hosted by Barov on administrative matters, and the letter sent to the king was also opened by him. If it is particularly important and exceeds the scope of the default response, the flight courier will be forwarded. To the front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just peace talks?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...they are not willing to hand over the power of the seal I also advise you to preserve the tradition and glory of the nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the spring of next year, the gang will naturally know what choices to make." Roland Shrug, "Would you like me to personally pass the purpose letter? Where did it come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A letter from the Shuguangcheng astrologer, one from the morning The kingdom," Barov handed over two stationery. "When they are sent, you are in a state of sleep, and the content is somewhat... weird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weird? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland first spreads the parchment with the constellation pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter is written by the Bachelor of Stars, the first half is a greeting and thanks - the astronomical telescope that was previously sent to the Star Watch has come in handy, they also thanked Of course, but the rest of the content made him feel awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The starry sky actually found the trace of the "Star of the World"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A star that flashes red and has a fixed position? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought of the synchronous track for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his poor astronomical knowledge, only objects that run on a synchronized orbit can remain relatively stationary with the planet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the red moon appears in this orbit, it is impossible not to affect the planet itself, and the observation results also indicate that its volume should be extremely small. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Red Moon is not a natural object, but an artificial satellite? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought for a moment and then rejected this speculation. If it is a satellite, how can it be "falling into the world"? According to Ai Gesha, when the red moon is in the world, people from all continents can see its existence - it is bigger and brighter than the moon, and the scarlet light makes the stone walls of the holy city dyed. A touch of blood, even in the daytime, can see its outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is totally unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was silent for a while before putting the stationery on the side. "Make a letter for me, invite astrologers to come to no winter city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But last time they rejected you," Barov hesitated "I am afraid this time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
