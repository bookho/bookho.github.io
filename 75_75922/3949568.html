			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it... she didn't follow you to sleep on the island?" The prince quickly realized what the other person said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is true," the five kings shook their heads helplessly. "This person is called Speer Passy. The ability is a magic channel. It can be used by several witches." The magic is connected. In other words, during the period of entry into force, the witch who connects to the passage can temporarily borrow the magic of other people and should be able to meet your requirements.” She paused. “She lives in the Dragon Ridge.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you know so clearly, you must have had contact with this witch," Roland said. "Why would she rather risk being caught by the church?" To stay there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly replied for a moment, "...because she is both a Marquis and a lord of the Dragon Ridge." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord?" He stunned, "A witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Her father, Paxi, who was the former lord, passed on her title and territory to her, not the second or third. Because of her high status, Speer can It’s good enough to hide identity, and the days are better than the average witch.” Tilly said slowly, “In the big migration, she took the initiative to find a door to help, so I can gather the towns in the south of the kingdom so quickly. Witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Proactively looking for the door"... Roland immediately noticed the stranger, "Wait... she doesn't plan to take in her compatriots?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Tilly shook her head. "Not only that, but she also hopes that these witches will leave their territory as soon as possible, so as not to be persecuted by the church. For the Lord, the position of the lord is obviously much more important."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the church finds that the lord is sheltering the witch, this position will undoubtedly become precarious - after all, Longling is no worse than the desolate Bianbu town. There are churches and resident priests in the area. The range of believers is also much larger than that of the West. Although Roland knew this truth, the choice of the other side still surprised him: "If the local witch is caught, is she..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also I have asked the other person this question," Terry said regretfully. "Spell Passy told me bluntly that if she was caught by the people, she would find a way to replace the witches with other death row in prison and then put them in the prison. Smuggling out of the country; but if it is seized by the trial army or judged by the church, she will basically choose to sit and watch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." To solve the hidden dangers of witches, the other party will take the initiative to choose to contact the five kings. The latter is probably because of this. In the end, they did not consider laying a heel in the Longling Ridge. Instead, they risked crossing the strait and heading to the strange fjord. Thinking of Roland, I couldn't help but frown. "Do you think I can ask her to go to Bianbu Town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No hope, but you can give it a try. "Tilly is a handkerchief. "I just told you that there is such a witch. I don't guarantee that she will come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland long sighed, "I will Let the messenger talk to her first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most suitable candidate for this messenger is undoubtedly the nightingale... able to avoid the eyes and ears of the people In the castle, you can also distinguish lies, as long as you show that you are not hostile, the other party probably will not take any radical action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes five or six days to take a boat from Bianbu Town to Danglongling. If you change to Maizi Air, you can reach your destination in just half a day. On the faster lightning, the trip is not too dangerous - the three of them are the most maneuverable combination in the Witch Alliance, and now with guns, they are both offensive and defensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking a little, Roland has noticed in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the success rate of the conviction of the Marquis is close to zero, it is a task to be implemented sooner or later to investigate the territory of the other party. The main point is just within his spring offensive plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that another witch in the castle has evolved?" Tilly suddenly changed the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, are you talking about the mystery month, she has indeed condensed the magic," Roland nodded and told her about the evolutionary process, "but Using the methods of ancient witches to promote evolution, the improvement of magic is not ideal. If you want to be like Anna, you still have to learn the basics honestly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
