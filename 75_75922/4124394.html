			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But my magic can continue to grow through practice, there is no limit to the number of promotions, right?" Lightning fell a little and did not have a frustrated look, "so Very good - can constantly exceed their limits, think about it is exciting! And, I can now be considered a half battle witch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Fighting battle!" Mai Hao Ang said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know that you are happy, but remember not to speed up over the castle next time, and add trouble to Roland." Wendy coughed twice. In addition, you have to save the magic of the next few days until all the tests are completed. Do you understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Wendy sister," Lightning playfully Spit out your tongue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has a different opinion in mind, so the speed of sound can certainly bring unparalleled mobility to the other side, but once the light magic is used, it is easy to fall into desperation. What's more, the size of lightning is much smaller than that of an airplane. It is still unclear how much damage it can cause to the devil when it breaks through the sound barrier. It is obviously not cost-effective to use it as a battle witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the demon who can disturb the magic effect on a large scale, it is a nemesis for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is more concerned about the duration of the opponent's subsonic speed - the speed of eight or nine hundred kilometers in this era is definitely a ride, no matter Whether to open up a map, or as a scout, to make up for the battlefield blind areas beyond the scope of Hilliâ€™s detection, is much more efficient than a simple battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as lightning was about to leave, Roland suddenly stopped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I still have a question to ask you," he considered the wording. "If... more than ten years later, this world will never again." What are you going to do when there is no danger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No risk...can you explore?" Lightning glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For example, every continent has been involved, and each sea area is recorded in detail by the chart. The whole world is unobstructed, and there is no longer an unknown situation. The place - although it sounds incredible, but if this happens, do you want to be an explorer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that "The little girl suddenly realized, "What do you mean, in the course of the Battle of God, the flock of explorers in the fjord have opened up the earth and the ocean, what should I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...you can understand this." Roland couldn't help but secretly confessed. He had already said that he was euphemistic, and he was still pointed at the core by the other side, and he was the biggest family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless they are as powerful as their father, but even then, I will continue to explore," Lightning said without hesitation, "because there are only places in me." It can't be achieved even if it is a father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning refers to the top of the head, full of confidence, "There is still a big gap in the sky!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until she retired, Roland endured Can't help but laugh out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should he say that he is a father and a daughter? This answer not only has a tone similar to that of the Thunder, but even further in the momentum - he does not know whether the fate of the explorer is really as the Thunder said, but there is a point that the other party is not wrong, in terms of talent, lightning It does have a height that is difficult for ordinary people to reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you laughing at?" The nightingale was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, looking at the clouded sky, his eyes as if he had penetrated the clouds and reached a farther depth - even though it Still unpredictable, but someone is watching it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am laughing...Young is so good," he said with emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dealing with the lightning, Roland left Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
