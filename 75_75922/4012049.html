			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This boat is too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stil leaned against the porthole of the tower and looked at the fleet that came and went from the Chishui River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since entering the Western Front, the river suddenly became busy, and most of the traffic was a quirky stone boat without sails, and the captain said that they called this The steamer, relying on steam power, is not affected by the wind direction. It is much faster than the sailboat when sailing in reverse. It often runs to the front with a string of black smoke. As for how the steam pushes the big wooden wheels on both sides of the hull, No one can say it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing is for sure, this is something that no winter city has created. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steel estimated in his heart that almost every half hour can see a paddle steamer, if they are all cargo, then no The amount of material absorbed by Winter City will undoubtedly be an amazing value. This is what she learned from the merchants - the bigger the city, the higher the ability to digest materials. As long as it stays on its official road for two days, it can roughly judge how prosperous the city is and how much business opportunities there are. . If you are good at communication, even the most demanding goods in the city can be analyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, this Chishui River is the most important traffic artery in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the busyness of the river also means that the propaganda she saw in Wangdu is probably not boastful by Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short period of time, the West is integrated into a new city, and the resident population and commercial trade have surpassed the original Wangdu, and such an extraordinary successor to the throne But there is a notoriety of not learning, and paranoia... Thinking of these rumors, Steele is more and more curious about Roland Wimbledon himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Conrad, are you watching the boat again?" The door of the room was pushed open, a brown-haired man dressed in a luxurious, handsome appearance came in "Would you like to go out and breathe, it’s boring to stay here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s good here," Steele straightened up to him. Nodded, "Thank you for your hospitality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where," he laughed. "It is my luck to be able to walk with such a beautiful lady like you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar flattering Steele listened too much, but she still responded with a happy look, "If you don't lend a helping hand, I am afraid I have to be huddled with those goods and the people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly can’t sit and watch this happen," the man sat down opposite her, "no gems Merchants will be willing to let the jewels dust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the owner of Yongchun, the gems merchant Victor from Wangdu. After the original ship was burnt down, Steele quickly picked the big ship from the ship that went to the west. It is not a passenger ship, nor a hire, but a private car belonging to Victor, but for the North Pearl, as long as the owner is a male, this is not a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will play herself as a North Korean aristocrat who went to the West to find a lost relative. In a few words, she will let Victor feel pity and invite her to board. The Yongchun number. Compared to ordinary small sailboats and cargo ships, Yongchun has a comfortable cabin, which is spacious and bright, and there is no decaying odor of wood that has been kept on the waterway all the year round. Even the master prepared two servants for her, and even one gold dragon was not charged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the only price is that Victor will come to the door from time to time to express his generosity and care, but this is for Stil, who is comfortable with the aristocratic circle. Said to have been used to it. If the other person is good enough, she will enjoy the feeling of driving the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These boats can be airless, but they are a little too simple," Victor poured a cup of black tea for himself. "I have boarded a The paddle steamer has been carefully observed. It is not only noisy, but also very tremor... It is good for hauling goods, but it is not a good choice for long-distance travel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, there won't be such a comfortable Yongchun," Steele said lightly. "But how do I feel that they are popping up overnight? Didn't there be such a ship in the West?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
