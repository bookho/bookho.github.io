			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silter...Jazz, dinner is ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene pushes away The door, a stiff ceremony, the voice is obviously somewhat restrained. This is the first time that the film has seen his wife show such a demeanor. Even in front of the prince, she is not so nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father?" He asked the jazz who had been silent since he came back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." The sir rubbed his eyes as if he woke up from his meditation. "First eat."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dishes on the small table are extraordinarily rich. At first glance, the wife ran a special convenience market. He smiled at Eileen and began to divide the bread as usual. The food in the block is divided into four equals - in addition to the three of them, Irene's friend, Mey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When coming back, Mey is discussing the drama with Irene. After he introduced his father to the two, most people will choose to leave at this time, but Mei Yes, she was only a brow, and she stayed with Irene after a simple ceremony. She even rarely stayed for dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made him really confused. I used to thank her for her, and she didn’t agree to invite her to dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Xiaochen Chenguang can’t care so much at the moment. Although he is calm and calm on the surface, he is also a mess in his heart. One is worried about his father’s opinion on his wife. Second, the attitude of the witch loves Gesha. It can be seen from the expression of his father's face that the family leader is obviously very concerned about this matter, but he does not know how to comfort it. The severance and distance from years has intensified this sense of estrangement. Can only eat heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Miss Mey is here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her topic in drama aroused her father’s interest, and then she talked with the jazz on the king’s style and aristocratic life, making this dinner finally disappear. So dull. And about the discussion of the new drama, Irene can also insert two sentences from time to time, the father even personally asked about the current situation of her performance, which made the film quietly relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, Mey made a resignation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helping his wife to finish the cutlery, the Jazz called him into the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your wife has made a good friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean Miss Mey "Filling slightly," she is indeed a rare and outstanding actor, helping Irene in drama. The last time I went to the fortress was also taking care of her-"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, I am not talking about performances," Sylt said with emotion. "You didn't find out? She has been demonstrating to me just now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;“Show...Wei?” Feilin’s eyes widened. Didn’t they both talk at the table? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha..." The old man couldn’t help but laugh, and he shook his head. "You really don’t understand the way the nobility deals. The king who she tells Seeing is a legendary experience of a relationship between a civilian woman and a nobleman. The drama is Cinderella. Even talking about upper politics is also the policy of His Royal Highness to withdraw the land. I think she must know that you are not willing to sever the relationship with the family. If I’m together, I won’t be able to talk to me every word.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes... is this?”<br /><br />&nbsp Sir Sir Sylt smiled. "It’s obviously more important than the fear of status, title, etc. The actual action of her own is obviously more important. After she said this, I am also a rougher about Miss Aisha. I figured out that no matter whether the ancestors had lied or not, we have already returned the things she had entrusted to her. Even if the ancestors of Aisha are unwilling to accept us, we can work for her in another way." He grew a sigh of relief here. "I don't believe this myself. Saying, but seeing the life of you and Irene, I suddenly feel that such an effort may not be futile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you..." The affirmation of the feeling made Feilin feel that the eye was hot, although the relationship was very decisive at the time, but he still hoped that the marriage would be recognized by the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
