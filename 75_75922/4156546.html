The nightingale said with some concern, "The new biplane was shipped here a day ago, and they even officially bombed The training has not been completed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belonging to Roland for a long time, she has basically understood the first army’s operational process, whenever there is new The rehearsal is an essential part of the plan. First, the staff department repeated the paper deduction to confirm that it is highly feasible before it will be transferred to the actual drill stage. Although the action was originally prepared for the sun's glory, it is also a relatively independent operation. According to the convention, the participants should first practice the project of bombing before they can be implemented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, but time is not waiting for people." Roland nodded. "At present, all reports indicate that Heckzold did not appear in the battle of the mountains... ... In other words, the letter played a role. The problem is that the nature of Scorpio is suspicious. No one knows how long a letter can let the other party leave the battlefield, so the faster the air strike is, the better."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, it is as tempting as the sniper war – how does the enemy react to the air strike? Does God of God have a corresponding defense? These are all issues that need to be confirmed before the final battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That...no training is no problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure," Roland smiled. "Tilly has come up with a solution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horizontal bombing was originally a technical activity that required the cooperation of personnel and on-board equipment. Realization, no practice for ten days and a half months will be heard. What's more, in order to grab the time, the first batch of Tianfur was not installed with bombing sights, even if you want to train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution given by Tilly is to let Sylvie come to be the command center - as long as the speed and altitude of the aircraft are determined, then the point of impact can be calculated As a result, the entire projectile process becomes extremely simple, and the driver does not even need to observe the ground. He only needs to pull up the unlock trigger when he hears the bombing command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea is quite similar to the early warning aircraft. The enemy, positioning and tracking are all done by a third party. When the fire data is transmitted to the combat aircraft, The latter opened the fire control radar and completed the final attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seagull is the early warning aircraft that controls the whole situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be the case." After listening to his explanation, the night glow showed a look of sorrow. "It’s not your Highness..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Roland raised an eyebrow. "I thought you would send out your emotions, and you wouldn't understand yourself."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, if it was possible before," she rolled her eyes. "But Anna is there, even if I know more people, I don’t understand myself. I I’ve been used to it for a long time.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can’t help but be dumb, this is not a glorious thing, why she can be so assertive. However, the other party can mention the past calmly and make him slightly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not to mention that I have understood one thing over the years..." The night shrug shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, you don't know everything?" Welcome to the soft morning sun, the bangs in front of the forehead shines golden light, "But since you asked, I will tell you what is difficult - that is, everyone has their own strengths, there is no need to blindly emulate others, loyal to You are the most important. Do you like... only those who know much more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Roland couldn't pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this answer does not need to be answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen from the other party’s expression that she is clear about this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case. So remember to put some chaotic drinks in the cupboard," the nightingale shook his fingers and turned to walk down the castle. "Wait for everyone to triumph Come back, I have to pull them to celebrate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
