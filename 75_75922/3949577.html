			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale passed through the three-layered roof and descended directly into the dungeon of the Marquis detained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell Passy heard the noise and looked up, could not help but widen his eyes, "Where... Where did you come in?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She made a squeaky gesture, limping out of the iron gate, standing on the aisle with two guards, watching the dress should be a believer in the church. She took the fog and stepped over to the two, pulling out the dagger and quickly cutting their throats - the two men wouldn't have expected someone to attack from the prison until they didn't look back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the prison, the nightingale has a chance to see his injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only seeing Soroya’s special windproof pants was cut open, the blood flow on the calves, the wounds are almost nailed deep, probably the enemy’s magic The whip penetrated the trousers from the side and took away a piece of flesh, but fortunately did not hurt the bones. If it is not the toughness of the coated pants, this shot may hurt even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are hurt," Speer frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem is not big, we have to leave here, and if you don't leave, you will become a dead body," the nightingale did not intend to take her to Hermes. The news told the Marquis, in her opinion, that is no different from death, perhaps worse. "They didn't know that you were a witch before they caught you. All this is a church-led conspiracy. What you want is just a dragon. The lord of the ridge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then my brother..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten have* * It has become a shackle for the church. The time is tight. I will explain it to you on the way." The nightingale tied the wound with the gauze that was carried around. "Where is the lock of the gods?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female marquis pointed to her neck. "Beginning is just a chain tied to the foot. Later they changed it to this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Hell, the heart of the nightingale suddenly sinks, only to see a thick metal ring on the neck of the other side - this kind of magic lock is to put a few god stones into the iron ring, Close together with special tools, personal power alone is extremely difficult to unravel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you remember which room the locking tool was placed in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Entry In the cell, they took me to the lock on that place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After apparently the Holy See found her true identity, she was replaced with the safest lock Oh, except for the extraordinary, it can almost trap all the witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to take Speer away, you must first remove this stuff, otherwise you will not be able to pull her into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We went to the first cell," the nightingale made the decision, "You follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sting from the leg, and she returned to the guard who fell to the ground again, took the key and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the top of the tower sounded a crisp bell, and the rushing bell echoed in the silent building, as if it was knocking on her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the church's alarm," Speer said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They will come sooner or later," said the nightingale, "only if you move faster than the enemy, you have a chance to survive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alarm that sounded at this time helped her in a sense. The believers who were stationed in the basement heard the bells and all gathered at the only exit of the prison. This undoubtedly gave The opportunity to play at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She descended from the fog, and the trigger was pulled at these people. Several bullets penetrated the body after hitting the first target, and they penetrated straight. In the body of the second person, a lot of blood was splashed. The stone of the gods they wear is the most eye-catching target in the black and white world. In the face of the nightingales, these people hold long swords and shields, but they don't know where to cut. After the two rounds of shooting, there was no living guard in the prison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
