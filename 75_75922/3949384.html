			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are more than one mouse like this. The iron axe looks at the person who was caught with a blank expression. "You are already the third jetty to escape." The people, the fugitives also said that you are not from the West, what other words are to be accounted for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people who were caught before, After cutting two fingers with a short sword, I immediately confessed my own origin and purpose. Of course, their bodies have been thrown into the canal—the iron axe has never been a soft-hearted person. The experience of the struggle in Tiesha City tells him that the best way to deal with this sneak peek is to stretch out. The hands are cut off one by one. But what surprised him was that the hands were tied, and the guys who were crushed on the ground looked very healthy and not as sick as they were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is the squad who sent the power? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not your enemy," he said in his first words. "My name is Hill Fox, and Tassa knows mine." Name!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taza has not left the dock area yet, being ironed After the subordinates called him, he glanced at Hill and snorted: "This person is a black hammer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not your person?" Asked the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have nothing to do with me, just a mouse that has just entered the line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Deceived the black hammer and deceived his fingers," Hill said suddenly. "You are not working for Tefco, but for the Royal Highness of Roland Wimbledon!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He knows too much." Tassa made a slap on the iron axe. "The best place for this person is the canal."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still talking about himself: "I heard about the mercenary propaganda, we can cooperate! I am willing to work for Your Royal Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness does not need the loyalty of the mouse," the iron axe pulled out the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a mouse, I am... the free people of Wangcheng, I am the enemy of Tefco!" Hill said loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait," Tassa called the iron axe and walked to the other side. The latter looked up and looked at the guard without fear. What is burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that...this is the answer that I never understood when I first saw him, Tassa thought. His eyes were filled with hatred. This hatred was so strong that even if he deliberately concealed it, he could not completely obscure the anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Talk about what you want to do for your Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do Living in Beicheng District, I occasionally go to the underground to graffiti, but I didn’t lose my family’s property because of gambling. My wife didn’t even run with others...” Hill gnashed his teeth. “She was killed by Fei Keke! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story is not complicated, and Tassa quickly figured out the ins and outs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and his wife were originally members of the "Dove and Hat" Acrobatic Troupe, and often performed in the inner city of Wangdu. The acrobatic group is not big, only seven people, the atmosphere is very harmonious. The wife, as the only woman in the group, has been consistently pursued by everyone. In the end, Hill won the victory and won her heart. The days after the marriage are very sweet, and it will take a long time for the two to accumulate savings in the inner city. But all this was destroyed by the Fitch's witch raids. Under the leadership of Langley, the patrols were like a group of mad dogs to arrest the suspects, and her wife was one of the unfortunate victims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill. Fox originally thought that as long as he paid the ransom, he would be able to let his wife get released, and then he could go to jail to see her. The warden accepted the ransom, but did not release her, and did not even promise him to visit the prison, but to appease that after waiting for a while to determine that his wife is not a witch, she would naturally let her out. As a result, I did not expect the situation to turn sharply. When he was notified to the prisoner, he saw a scarred body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
