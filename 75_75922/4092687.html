			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a good night's sleep, the next three people set off again. After a long flight, Luo Jia finally saw the "abandoned city" figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn't help but hold her breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This city is too big! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sky, the earth beneath the feet is a large piece of green, almost endless, while the taupe wall and the broken wall are interspersed between the green fields. According to lightning, the city was abandoned four hundred years ago, but until now, it can still distinguish its incomplete wall contour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you estimate according to the scope of the ruins, the city is bigger than the five or six iron sands, and the number of people you can accommodate is more than 100,000. Even now that she has become a pile of broken wreckage, she can feel the grandeur that the city should have. If the ratio of one to ten is used to infer the towns and villages in the surrounding cities, does it mean that nearly a million people have gathered in this wilderness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is incredible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the kingdom of such a big city be built, actually lost to the devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia couldn’t help but think of what he said - "The battle of God is not a small fight between the two tribes, but two decisions." "Which civilization can continue the full-scale war," she began to be quite uncomfortable, but at the moment she suddenly understood. And the phrase "I don't want you to die" is now thinking about it, and it doesn't mean the intentional intimidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know why, the wolf girl is a lot more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning gestured, the three descended to the height and eventually landed on a fairly complete wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mottled wall top is almost 20 steps wide enough to accommodate two four-wheeled carriages side by side. On the wall covered with moss and vines, you can still see a few round holes, and you don't know how much force you need to leave such damage on the boulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should already know," said the little girl. "This was originally the last line of defense of the Witch Empire. Unfortunately, they did not resist the devil's offensive. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the witch that has been mentioned by Ashes, who has lived for more than four hundred years and will never die, is actually the Witch Empire. Survived members? It is because of their destruction that they have the four kingdoms of today and the churches that regard witches as heretics? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women did not ask what they thought in their minds. Since they have never heard of travellers telling about this history, even the residents of No Winter City have Nothing to know, it is only because the person who knows it does not want to spread the news. She always remembers that she is not a member of the Witch Alliance, and there is no need to know too much about some things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took out a map of the lightning that was handed over to her yesterday, and spread it out in front of her eyes. "Tajira is the border area of ​​your usual investigation? The devil wants In which direction does the attack have no winter city?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are possibilities in the west of the ruins, but it will be very dangerous if you want to go deep into the wild, even if Staying in the air is not necessarily insurance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the fog." Mai said, "Sometimes it will be dyed red!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "That is... what?" Luo Jia frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil needs to survive, just like the air we breathe." Lightning looks northwest. "The weather is good today, so it looks like the sky." It’s very blue, but sometimes it’s rainy, especially when it’s covered with clouds. When you fly high, you can see the red mist on the edge of the horizon. This thing is very poisonous for the witch, even if it’s not inhaled, it’s light. Touching can also cause serious harm. Because we don’t know how far it can drift, we rarely cross the line of Takira.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl will follow the devil’s The weaknesses are roughly covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
