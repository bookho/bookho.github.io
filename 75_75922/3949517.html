			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can ordinary people overcome the weapons of the extraordinary witch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Wendy left, Ai Gesha has been thinking about this sentence, do they really know what is extraordinary? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is no balance of magic stones on hand, or you can clearly understand the magic and variety of these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was almost impatient, the nightingale appeared at the door of her room. "His Royal Highness invites you to visit a new weapon, if you don't want to go -" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going," she said, "Please take the lead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See one Face screaming, yawning Prince Roland, Ai Gesha suddenly had a kind of smashing his face, let him be sober and sober. However, this kind of behavior that easily causes misunderstandings of other witches can only be thought out in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the castle, she was the first to see the whole picture of the town during the day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the backdrop of heavy snow, the first thing that leaps into the mind is neatness - a tidy double-storey house stands side by side, and the shapes are exactly the same. The white outline and the red brick roof are particularly well coordinated. The black streets are all straight and straight, dividing the town into blocks of similar size, looking from a distance to the distance. The scenery seen is completely a cycle of buildings, trees, streets, trees, streets, like a layer. Stacked up in general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Tajira, the inner city can't be so neat and orderly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it made her feel like she was pulling back to the city. In addition to the castle, there is no other building worth seeing in the town, even the castle. In itself, the degree of grandeur is far less than the treacherous tower of Takira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, it’s just a small town, and Ai Gesha snorted in disdain and turned to look at the nightingale. “How many people live here?” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... there were only over 2,000 people in the beginning, and now the emigrants in the North and South are close to 30,000."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand people dare to say that they must defeat the devil, it is idiotic to say - wait, three ... 30,000? Ai Gesha's eyes widened. Takila also accommodated 50,000 people during the peak period. Can this slap-sized place have 30,000 residents? She will not count the population of the surrounding villages, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these boxy brick houses seem to accommodate more households than wood bungalows, the increase in residents is not a simple digital stack. When the population exceeds one limit, the demand for the city will multiply. The first is the sharp increase in demand for food and drinking water, followed by the deterioration of public order caused by the expansion of the shack area and slums. Finally, even the treatment of manure has become a thorny issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the second war of gods, Tacula had encountered such a problem - as the major cities fell and flooded into the Holy City The number of people has soared, and the burden of the population has not only not strengthened the defensive power, but has caused the city to be almost paralyzed until the Federation has forced the removal of a group of refugees to stabilize the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of personal experience, Ai Gesha knows the difficulty of expanding the urban population. Looking at the other person's careless appearance, she will be suspicious in her heart, perhaps the nightingale does not know the answer, but is cheating on herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still questions to Wendy in the future. She thinks that at least the latter’s attitude seems more sincere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the streets where people come and go, Ai Gesha followed the prince and others to board a wall made of mud. This low wall is completely sturdy and strong, and there is no barb on the wall. There is no moat around. The devil does not even need engineering equipment, and can climb up by hand and foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disappointment in her heart added another point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city wall has a front and rear bulge every 100 steps or so. The more spacious platform seems to be left for the erection of the bed. It took a long time to walk along the top of the wall, and Ai Gesha quickly saw the object of the test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a long tubular object made of metal, a bit like an iron spear that was magnified several times, but it did not have a spear tip. It is smooth and looks silvery gray, not like iron. The components at the end of the long tube are more complicated. In addition to the fixed bracket, there are two shorter tubes attached to the upper and lower sides of the main pipe. There are no ropes or arrows. The light is not like a magnified bed or from the outside. Stone throwing machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she also did not figure out how to attack the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the latest development weapon of Bentham Town, a standard 152mm fortress that symbolizes justice and glory!" The prince raised his hand, "compared to twelve Pound Field Cannon, which has many improvements and outstanding indicators, is definitely an epoch-making weapon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha could not help but wrinkle Brow, what justice and glory, the fortress is standard, it sounds frivolous. After a series of introductions, it seems to be very mouth-watering. Is he really a versatile scholar in Wendy's mouth, and trusted by the witches? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," the scene was only applauded by the night, and the atmosphere seemed a bit stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," Roland cleared his throat. "There is no more nonsense, let's test it now. Iron axe, let's get started."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness." The three men in uniforms immediately acted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha stood on the side and stared at each of these people's movements intently, hoping to find out how this weapon works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw one person sliding down the iron block at the end of the long tube, and the other immediately stuffed an orange-yellow pointed object into the tube, and then closed the iron block. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Report, ready to be completed, can be launched!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone puts on the ear," Prince Did a demonstration, nodded, "open fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait... get ready so soon? Ai Gesha just wanted to ask, and a loud bang suddenly exploded in the ear! Her head screamed in silence, and the surrounding area suddenly quieted down. The front part of the metal long tube sprayed a group of orange-red flames, dazzling and short-lived. At that moment, she felt the powerful power contained in the flame. The wall under the foot seemed to tremble, and a heat wave rushed to the face, and the body stood almost. Stayed in two steps. The artillery itself slammed back to sink - but it quickly returned to its original position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"————" The nightingale supported her from behind and seemed to be saying something, but she could only faintly hear the intermittent discourse, as if It came from far away places... until the humming sound faded, and the hearing returned to normal. "Are you okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head and looked away Moved to the open snow in front, but nothing has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this flame just to intimidate the enemy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you observing the drop?" The prince asked a witch with green hair around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After a small hill, the nearest red flag is," the latter waited for a while, "but still far away." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red flag? Ai Gesha looked at Roland puzzledly. What the hell are they talking about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the prince of the prince quickly answered her doubts. "This weapon can be used as a projectile - you understand it as a smashing arrow - project it out, use In order to attack the enemies still far away. In order to observe the range of the shelling, I let the lightning put the flags below every one kilometer. The red flag is already the last shot and stands five kilometers away." He explained, "According to you Familiar size conversion, almost one hundred kilometers in a kilometer, close to two miles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha is in the same place, is it the other side? What does it mean that it just sent the arrow that was stuffed into the ten miles away? There are no ropes and accumulators. How does it do this? Be aware that even the magic-driven siege beasts are only three to four miles away. If he does not lie, as long as the construction of a towering and thick wall, with such weapons, can effectively block the pace of the devil's attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
