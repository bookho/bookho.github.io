			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big chaos in the anticipation did not come to Jin Suicheng, and the situation was completely beyond the imagination of Bell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the clerk of several city owners, he naturally knows what it means to break the city - looting, killing, disorder, exile... no matter the knight in the city There are no essential differences between mobs and pirates. Tefco’s squad is so bad, as is the new Duke’s superior position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food and wealth in the city is the best reward for the power-seekers. It is a matter of righteousness to be as much as possible. It is as if the nobles were born more noble than ordinary people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The records in the history books have also proved its correctness many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time the situation is completely different - Roland’s army not only did not take the city people to open the knife, but launched relief and appeasement work, found in the castle of the Duke The piles of wheat are cooked into wheat porridge and distributed to the hungry people; a lot of recruitment news is posted in the center of the square. Participants can get a certain amount of reward in addition to food! Didn't the soldiers of Roland care about what they should have belonged to, and were they handed out to a group of unrelated people? Isn’t the four princes who have set up Jin Suicheng in a thousand miles to squander their own treasury? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall types of books, Bell has never seen such a ridiculous precedent in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these only make him feel amazed at most, and the other thing makes the clerk feel deep fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the castle fire a few days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The propaganda of the arson in the mouse is full of loopholes. He has served three dukes and lived in the castle for more than 20 years and never found it. Passing through the entrance of the secret passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this life-and-death escape route, it must be designed to be very concealed and safe, even if it is difficult to find traces inside, let alone invade from the outside. If the guys have this ability, they will not fall into a black street mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire was put by Roland's people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After realizing this, Bell felt his heart jerked by something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time the nobility became no longer nobler than the civilians, their lives were the same as those who were filled in the wall, and there was no security at all. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe more dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big family that has not yet been turned into a pot by Roland clearly thinks about this. Their response is very direct, that is, leaving Jin Suicheng... even leaving the Grey Fort . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then what? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will such a thing come to his head? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent days, the clerk’s hair has fallen one after another, and the blank area above the head has grown larger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fear is not from vain imagination. For the past ten years, he has been called the nobility without title, or the closest to the nobility. Aristocrats - He served many lords, and he was well-informed and read more books than most of his family. Because of this, whether it is Garcia's looting or the alternation of the East, he is safe and sound, even if the people in the city are screened over and over again like straw, he still has the energy to observe and record. Those sights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Bell can't sleep when he sleeps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the powerful army has not yet touched any non-nobles - even the ordinary people who have worked for the big family, he really does not dare This will still be the case after the other party is determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t ask the families to take him away because he’s still civilian. He is not willing to sit still, and he always wants to do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the swaying candlelight, the clerk shifted his gaze to the still-written Jinshencheng Chronicles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I almost forgot this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he quickly flipped to the last few pages, tore it off and lit the pieces of paper until They turn into ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, maybe that’s not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bell thought for a moment, took out a quill, stained with ink and stood on the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter what the outcome, you have to record it truthfully, understand?" - His voice rang the voice of Duke Willie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he will now record it as it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the responsibility of a clerk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no absolute objectivity in this world. He lives in the city ruled by Roland. It is not surprising that there is a slight bias. Or, this is An objective part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bell took a deep breath and quickly dropped the pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The messenger sent by the great King Roland Wimbledon arrived today in his loyal Golden Spike..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first military camp on the outskirts of Chishuicheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, there is a secret letter sent from the East."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night jumps out The fog, holding a gray goshawk in his hand. The latter slammed his claws toward Roland, groaning dissatisfiedly, as if complaining that the letter was too heavy - its claws were full of six rolls of paper, almost filling the entire space of the legs. The flight messenger was quiet until the night of the night, handing a handful of dried fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, this is no longer a secret letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland unfolds six pieces of densely written papers in turn, and quickly browses them again. The sender is an iron axe, and the main content is the post-war routine summary and situation. report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first half is the same as his prediction. The Eastern Army easily conquered Jinsuicheng, and the mortars showed great power in the battle. The firepower delivery efficiency of the super 12-pound field gun, even if it is a siege war, the enemy has no power to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But seeing the second half, Roland was a little surprised and snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why, what's the problem there?" asked the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well... it’s not a problem, it’s just a little weird," he handed the fifth letter to the other party. "Look at it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Incinerate the dungeons that imprisoned the nobility?" The nightingale swept over the eyes and immediately caught the focus. "Is this not your order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head. "No, I only told him that the Eastern War is his sole responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then...what is it?" She said, "Since it is full responsibility, what kind of action is taken as a normal move? Not to mention the guys themselves are uneasy, have not surrendered to you for so long, now a sweep If you are clean, you can use it to clear the mouse. You can count it as one of the best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right..." Roland touched Chin, but he always felt that this treatment is too literary. The East is the place where the second prince lived for a long time. It is only the first step to capture the city. Down infighting is the key to the surrender of nobility. Therefore, he handed over the majority of the officials trained by the City Hall to the east, and appointed the iron axe from the Shamin to be the commander of the Eastern Front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his expectations, after the Iron Axe took the Golden Suicheng, in order to eliminate the enemy, in all likelihood, his torture skills will be maximized - even The high-ranking priests of the church were not able to torture the Mokins, let alone the delicate nobles. Through bloody trials and executions, the old forces of the nobility were destroyed step by step, thus establishing a new order in the east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
