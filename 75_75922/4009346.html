			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No winter city, north of the border wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iphie came to the previous ability test site and found that there was no sorceress on the grassland, among them, the wheat pupa and the yellow hair that was inseparable from her. girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing himself, the guy waved his fist in disgust, and after making a face, he pulled the wheat stubb away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days ago, Ifi must have learned two people and let them know that they should be respected in front of the fighting witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, she just smiles silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the look of the yellow-haired girl, she unconsciously remembered Anne. At that time, Anne was just like her, always cautious and alert, keeping herself behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are just the escapers who happen to be traveling together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably, this is the so-called...sister in the league. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since everyone is here, I will explain the next task. The codename "melting point" is directed by Ms. Ai Gesha. . "Your majesty went to the center of the crowd. "Of course, many people have already known the contents of the mission in advance, but in order to take care of the newcomers, I will say it again from the beginning. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newcomers...Do you mean yourself?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iife immediately gathered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, this is the first task that the new owner confesses, and assigning himself to participate is definitely related to the battle, which is an opportunity to show the value of his own ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to understand the enemy's ability and to promote the study of the magic stone, you will go to the devil camp behind the snow-capped mountains to induce the devil to attack and then use the ambush oysters. Adversary..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland Wimbledon finished speaking, Iphi I haven’t been able to return to my heart for a long time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no problem with my ears, God, is he serious?<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A devil's enemies destroyed the witch empire that once ruled the mainland? The blue-haired woman who was the commander of the action was the high-ranking witch from more than four hundred years ago? Will defeat determine the destiny of mankind? And these ferocious enemies are hiding in the distance not far from the West?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this possible!<br /><br />&nbsp ;[# nbsp;&nbsp; They have already known this news.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next step is to explain the things to be aware of in the "melting point" action, as well as the tactical arrangements. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha nodded and said, "According to the existing information, there is a warning eye in the camp, which is also the key to the lure plan." - As long as someone sees it, it can see each other at the same time. If the distance is far away, the first thing to do is to fly the beast. The number of such devils is not large. It is impossible to appear on a large scale in a remote place. If it is two at the time, this time should also be on this number. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Air combat is not good for us, so the best way is to pull them to the ground so that I can solve two beasts by myself. The madness is the goal of Miss Efe," she looked at Effie. "Use your ability to imprison the enemy, and the action is done." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the other party think that it is only a little bigger than herself, and her life span is more than four hundred years? Iphi has been stunned for a while. "I... I know." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
