			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the Western Wall, the fugitives under the guidance of the First Army soldiers received an unprecedented identity check. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barof naturally knows that the population is the most valued wealth of His Royal Highness. In order to bring these people back to Bianbu Town, His Royal Highness has spent a lot of gold dragons, even at the expense of dispatch. The first army expedition to the king. When the Margaret Chamber of Commerce’s bill was placed in front of Barov, he almost stunned his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of half a month, the caravan fees, transportation fees, food supply fees, etc. provided by the caravan added up, and actually spent more than 2,000 Jinlong , equivalent to the price of four steam engines. If it was not for the conversion deposit of two sailboats received last month, this financial statement is likely to have a deficit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the fugitives came back, the tedious and huge statistical work fell on him. Almost all the town hall officials and apprentices were dispatched, and wooden sheds and passages were set up at the foot of the city wall. These people were classified and recorded. Looking at the fugitives who lined up in more than a dozen teams slowly passing through the checkpoint, Barov seemed to see a group of moving coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional talent channel that he personally took care of was much colder than the ordinary civilian registries of the queues. So far, only five or six have passed. Ten people only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am...a carpenter," at this time, a middle-aged man came over cautiously. "I heard that any craftsman can get a place." "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," said Sene Dali. "What is your name? Literacy?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight of the original rushing wolf was very handy in the Ministry of Agriculture, at least until now, Barov has been very satisfied with his own eyes. Although this time it was demographics, there were so many people who were literate in the city hall, so they had to pull people from other departments together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...back to the grown-up, my name is Mather." The other party paused. "I don't know the word."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you read or write?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The middle-aged man bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, the carpenter's words..." Sene turned to the form marked with the word carpenter in a stack of inquiry forms, "Oh, found it. Let I asked you a few questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This first-in-class method was thought out by His Royal Highness Prince. He brought together the craftsmen of various industries and asked them some professions. Knowledge and corresponding treatment methods, and record the answers to form a set of inquiry forms. In this way, as long as you ask a few questions against the form during the review, you can immediately know if the other person is lying. When I first saw this method of lie detection, Barov couldn't help but want to be cautious about the devil. If he didn't work in the industry, most civilians would not understand these things. If one wants to impersonate If you have two or three sentences, you can't say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What tools are used to flatten the surface of wood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... , adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the commonly used saws?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Frame saws and saws When you cut small pieces, you will occasionally use a hand saw."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few questions asked, Mather could almost answer, and the tone of the conversation was also Gradually getting smoother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it seems that you are indeed a carpenter," Barney stopped him when he was going to write down the person’s name on the status register. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t judge so quickly, look at his hands first He looked at Mather. "Let your hand stick out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Massell heard this and stunned Hands--The skin in the palm is rough, the cracked lines are mixed with many soil particles, and there are thick scorpions under each finger, which looks weather-beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
