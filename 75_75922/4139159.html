"Are you alright?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what happened to me?" Roland cleared his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Looking at the drawings in a daze, the look is not very good-looking - is there any bad news on it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, maybe it’s just that I think more." Roland shook his head and briefly told his guess. "If the world is like this, it would be too desperate."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One problem that cannot be ignored is that thousands of years are really a short cycle for life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are the humans when the radioactive and stickman are fighting for you? Where is the devil? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the battle of divineity lasts for a long time, then the civilization that won the gods before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how tragic the war is, a winner will be born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but why are they missing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the thought of this, Roland felt that the road ahead was a lot harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that..." The nightingale thought, "But even if you guess it's all right, I don't think it's a solution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at her unexpectedly. "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say, I am not Anna. , so there is no way to say one or two or three, just a personal thought, you can't laugh, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guide not to laugh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale stuffed a piece of dried fish into his mouth. "First of all, I have to admit that this is not a problem that can be reversed by one or two generations. Is it right? So the most important thing is to put The message goes on until the moment is ripe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well... makes sense," Roland nodded. "And then?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?" He gave a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because that has nothing to do with us." The night is of course, "The life of a person is so limited, it is not easy to complete the duties of this life." Why bother to worry about the things that follow. As for those who do what they can, it is their responsibility. If you want to be white, it doesn't make sense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but open his mouth... Is this a comfort? But no matter what, such a simple and straightforward, clear-cut idea is indeed the style of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to laugh at me short-sighted?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Roland immediately closed his mouth. "You think very thoroughly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This is almost the same.” She raised her head and said with a slight smugness. “And if you are worried that the latecomers are not capable enough to take up this responsibility, they can also share it with other ethnic groups.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Assessing? How to do it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Building the ruins and recording the “truth” of the war of divineity – this is also a kind of message method. Didn't you find the existence of the radios and stickman from the murals of the cursed temple? In the gray fort, build several strong underground fortresses and engrave the paintings on the wall to warn other civilized groups who participated in the war. If the time is long enough, I think there will always be one or two races waiting for the time to mature. A moment. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but hold the night, but the words of the nightingale can not only be said to be short-lived, but can even be said to be extremely far-reaching. If humans are in the war of fate The complete annihilation, the cessation of continuation, does not mean that we will withdraw from the stage. Using this method to pass on the idea, as long as the winner jumps out of the framework, human civilization will inevitably be recorded in history.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Roland shook her head with a smile and poured a chaotic drink on her. "With your head, it is very good to think of this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The first half of the sentence can be omitted." Although the nightingale said so, he did not hesitate to take the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, that is the last and most helpless means. He thought. But if he can, he hopes that human beings can become recorders, not a recorded symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling Shaun, after handing the stone in the parcel to Catherine, Roland put in a day's work. In the afternoon, there was a man in the castle who had been waiting for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleeping Island Butler Carmela Darry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange thing is that she didn’t walk with Tilly, and she didn’t have any signs of care, and she still kept the appearance of the servant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows that the other party is likely to go straight to the castle and not even go to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s heart faintly raised a bad feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven’t arrived in Wintertown?" He personally gave Camilla a cup of tea. "It’s hard, is the Thunder’s adventure going smoothly? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter will drink the tea and almost get it by the water. "Cough... Keke, the shadow island has an accident, Joan she and her." ...... disappeared!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Disappear?" Roland felt a sinking in his heart, and could not help but look at the nightingale. "What happened, you slowly said to I listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...probably the process is like this," Camilla took half an hour to tell the whole story, "We waited outside the sea." For two days, I couldn't wait until Joan came back. Thunder said that only you can know what happened to Joan under the water. The distorted scene, the floating column island... Is it really something that can exist in reality? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will happen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can't help but lick his forehead, the deeper the understanding of the world, the more he can feel its weirdness - before that, the dream is full of uncoordinated Wherever it seems, the reality is not good enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elongated stone pillars and marine fish are not caused by external forces from the description. The obvious evidence is that Joan is being pulled into the deep sea. Before, Camilla saw her fingers suddenly grow. If it is hard to pull out, the big housekeeper in the state of spiritual resonance will definitely feel the unbearable pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in fact, neither Joan nor Camilla were aware of any physical discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing he can think of is the distortion of the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it sounds bizarre, there is no evidence, but he knows he has to say something. The reason why Camilla didn't go to find Tilly first, and did not wait for the fatigue to recover before reporting, obviously can't wait to know Joan's safety. Judging from her bloodshot eyes, perhaps she didn't sleep well on this road, which made Camilla so anxious. In addition to worry, I am afraid there is still a lot of self-blame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, even if it is Hu, you have to make something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there is an example of the "sea line" perpendicular to the sea. Even if he pulls it anymore, it will not be too exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland licked his forehead and sighed for a long time. "I think the Thunder's decision is correct."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camilla immediately raised his head. "Do you think that Joan is still alive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, and she is likely to go. East of the sea line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the blink of an eye, miles apart, is this... really possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just speculated that the first thing I can be sure of is that the water surface of the entire shadowy area has indeed dropped. Is it correct? This change can even affect the tides and tides of the fjord islands, and the amount of water must be very high. Amazing. So, where did the falling water go?” Roland picked up the quill and drew a circle on the paper. “I guess it is the east side of the sea line.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
