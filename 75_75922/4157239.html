			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not a dead thing... What does it mean?" The nightingale frowned. "Is it difficult to talk in the mine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was no such discovery for the time being, but when I tested at the bottom of the Hermes vein, I accidentally discovered several mice that were eroded by the god stone." Isabella closed Looking up at the eyes, it seems to recall the scene at the time. "They may be the lost people who flowed from the upper level of the fascinating body into the bottom of the hole after the collapse of the new holy city. No one knows how the mice were captured by the gods, but their bodies have a part. It has fallen into the stone of God, just like... it is like the integration of the two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The turpent can also be regarded as a whole when it is wrapped with insects, but Amber is still not a living thing," Roland said bluntly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Isabella’s face showed a hint of fear. "If that's the case, I won't make this assertion. The problem is that The mouse is still alive, and when I am close, it will scream at me as if asking me to release it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but fight A chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly understood why the other party was scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown brings fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she stood in front of an unprecedented field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...will it be that the mouse has just been fixed up?" The nightingale asked easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I watched for three months and nine days, their calls never stopped." Isabella sighed, "on the tenth day I separated one of them with a dagger - and found that its stomach has long been empty, and even severely atrophied because of long-term abandonment, but some of its blood vessels have grown into the stone."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that for the entire three months, the mouse is provided with the energy needed for survival...is the god stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that it’s too simple to think about it. Roland can’t help but smile. He used to think that “only living things can gather magic” is the result of not knowing enough about magic. Rumors, this evidence found by Isabella has undoubtedly greatly advanced the rumor to the reality of the transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen in the church's catalogue that some rare plants can be connected with animals to form a strange symbiotic relationship," she continued. Although it is impossible to conclude that the stone is a plant, it is at least not a dead thing. According to this idea, some unique phenomena of the devil are easier to understand - such as the growing obelisk and the giant monster seen at the bottom of the monument. Etc. They may have used this to build the current ethnic system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, the devil really likes to use stones... "The nightingale is thoughtful." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately my research is still very shallow, most of them only stay in the surface guessing stage and can't bring you any substantial help." Isabe Largo apologized and bowed his head. "The reason for not only merging has not yet been ascertained, even the transformation of the magic stone can only create low-grade magic stones such as illuminating stones and screaming stones-"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too small to see your own discovery." Roland interrupted, "No matter whether the 'wave frequency' determines the correctness of the effect, it is just proof that the witch can make the magic stone through the ability. One point, your name is enough to go down in history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say no regrets, it is definitely lie to yourself. If the other party's energy produces high-quality magic stones, it also means that powerful imprints like infinity and gods can be used indefinitely, and the fighting witch can also become a pivotal force on the battlefield. However, he also knows that the exploration of magic is bound to be a long and tortuous process. Now Isabella has just opened the door and glimpsed one of the corners. As long as she can continue the research, in terms of the average life expectancy of the witch, the results are undoubtedly worth looking forward to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Isabella retired, Roland immediately opened the pen and paper and planned to send a telegram to the City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message is very simple, there is only one sentence: no winter city can not be lost, start the emergency plan from now on, enter the state of war mobilization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
