When the other person talked about the reasons for changing his mind, he couldn't help but swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, no?" Tilly embraced her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the rules of the Air Knight Academy are all set by you, of course you have the final say." Roland quickly waved. "I am just curious, I feel this." What can you represent?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Representative talent. Sure enough, you don’t know anything about flying.” Tilly shrugged. “For the average person, practice. However, it is done according to the conditional requirements of the manual. There is nothing but the execution of the action itself, even if it is the same in the sky. But some people can imagine the picture of each action. When he has not taken action, he will I have already seen the result of the action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... Is it so amazing?" Roland smoked his mouth and he did not deny that he was ignorant of the flight, if not With the help of Tilly, the Air Knight program has no way to talk about it. It is no different from whimsy to create a qualified airplane from the drawings in the dream world. No matter whether it is trial production, improvement, stereotype or training, it is inseparable. Li's participation. If you change to an ordinary person and want to turn the drawing into a real machine and then use the real machine for combat, this process may have to be explored for decades. It’s just that the plane is a machine. Isn’t it necessary to follow the manual and practice it again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I am like this." Tilly showed a regrettable look. "You can't imagine that you don't have talent in this area. Brother, if You are also a member of the Air Knight Academy, I am afraid that it belongs to the group to be eliminated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough..." Roland almost didn't get caught in the saliva. And behind him there was a snoring sound of night laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that you can master the flight by practice?" Tilly seems to see his thoughts. "There are some people who can After a hundred exercises, connect the action with the feeling, but don't forget that this is a kind of talent in itself, but it is a little less than the former. More people can never reach this step, it is not easy to fly. What do you think is more likely to survive the war?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is no doubt that the answer is talented. Spending the same amount of time to train, these people tend to reach higher levels, and quickly accumulate experience in the war, and the ability to level up even to protect themselves is very difficult, not to mention further fine. From the perspective of the cost-effectiveness of training, the former can reach several times the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it is impossible to determine anything with one statement?" He said without a word for a while. "After all, there is still the possibility of being right." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So I know everything when I fly." Tilly didn't think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What about the other two?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They all chose to fly." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Roland blinked with some surprise. The expulsion of the Knights College was not a fluttering disposition in this era, especially when the head of the college was the Princess of the Princess. It means that it will leave a disgraceful mark on the resume, and it will be much more difficult to apply for other jobs. Secondly, the compensation for ground handling and chores is not low. It is also a stable job, and you can also enjoy some preferential policies of the college, such as buying a house and medical care. Compared with before and after, it can be said that the gap is very large. "It doesn't count as courage... If you just fired it, don't you think it's a pity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the current preparatory pilots of No Winter City are not yet To two hundred people, each one is precious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Air Knight Academy does not need people who have no talent, and has the courage to face death in the face of fear of the beast. It is better to let them leave earlier." Tilly whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, the atmosphere in the office was a bit dignified. Just as Roland prepared to pour a drink to ease the atmosphere, the other party took the initiative to change the subject. "Right, I am looking for you to ask the previous question - is my new aircraft a clue?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
