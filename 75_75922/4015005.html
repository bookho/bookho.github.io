			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So... is it successful?" Anna asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the next step is to cut it and seal it with silver foil." Ai Gesha nodded. "The seals are different depending on the type. The way is different. For example, screaming can not be cut and must be used as a whole."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it fails?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The blood line can't gather magic, the reason is unknown, no matter how good the raw materials are used, there is always a chance of this happening. The solution is also very simple, take the magic stone out and do it again. Just fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it takes extra blood..." Anna frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So in Takira, the blood of the devil is more precious than the witch," Aegusa laughed and laughed. "If you waste it during the experiment." Witch blood, no one cares, but if you lose the devil, scolding and punishment are indispensable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final six prints failed two, although the previous steps were exactly the same, but the two blood lines did not respond after injecting magic, in other words, they did not survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha took the magic stone and took out the spare wooden box to continue the second production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She must hurry and the devil is dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aliens fixed on the wooden table emit irregular sputum, the blue-black skin gradually turns to gray, a lot of blood loss makes it breathe stronger, the red under the helmet The color of the fog is obviously faded. Once the fog is exhausted, the devil will die in a very short period of time, and at that time the blood can only last for about a quarter of an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait," when Ai Gesha raised her knife, Anna stopped her. "Use my blood."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just intended to refuse, Anna has already cut the skin of her wrist with black fire. "Nanawa can only heal the wound, can't help you to add blood, and said that if you lose too much blood, you will Cause dizziness, fainting if you are not good, this is not good for your subsequent tests. Of course, it is best to rest and practice and production after two days of rest, during which you can eat more meat porridge and liver, it will recover faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Is this what you said?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, every witch has been there. Trauma self-help class.” Anna smiled. “And the purpose of your job as an assistant is to let me learn how to make a print. It’s better for me to operate the two.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha silenced the little meeting, "So trouble you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're welcome," she said easily, "I Ten of this Interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...In the end, under the attack of the devil, the witch empire collapsed and completely disintegrated. The surviving people turned over the mountains, crossed the river, came to this wild land, and re-established the town. Preparing for the third and final battle of the gods, this is the truth of history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland said after holding his chin, quietly looking at Iraq Tis's look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon sun shines into the room, sprinkling a radiance on the desk, the woman’s meditation looks like a statue, and the blue hair is reflected in the sun. White, the good face did not appear to be eclipsed by these shocking news. As he expected, it was more curious and inspiring in the eyes of Itis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been immersed for a long time before slowly opening the way, "You must not make up such an incredible story to fool me. The devil really has that Is it powerful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Undoubtedly, they are not only fierce, but also very amazing. My army can easily defeat the Knights of Tiffco, but not necessarily They can stabilize the devil. After all, they have been lurking in the northwest of the world for four hundred years. They don’t need to start from scratch like a witch. The most important thing is that this war has no possibility of peace. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
