			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So... Mr. Roland, the association’s third line of defense is entrusted to You are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not worry, I will do my best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland to the Rock After saying goodbye, walk out of the guard office and gently vomit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things are not as smooth as he thought, Prism City’s tracking of the Devils has also stagnate, and he has not been able to get more information about the whereabouts of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian informed him to come, mainly to arrange the garrison task of the martial arts conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan also mentioned before, after the frustration of the tracking action, it became one of the main programs to counter the enemy - since the demon Deep, it is better to stay at the conference. In order to prevent internal consumption, the association's high-level officials simply set a table of competition progress, asking the star martial artists to follow the contents of the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, this martial arts conference will be completely transformed into a well-arranged trap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are suspected anti-counterfeiting games, everyone is clear and contemptuous in the face of the crisis of survival. In addition, the top management attaches great importance to this, and each one individually pulls into the office to talk about it, and it also saves the face of everyone. When Roland came to see a lot of star figures in the hall, no one showed any dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan, the entire defense circle is divided into four layers. The government guards and the members of the association posing as the audience are the first floor. The main task is to identify the enemy and solve the problem. Those who are singles are the slayers; the second is the star martial arts on the stage and the stage; the third is the old-fashioned confidant, and the last is the Guardian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This complicated arrangement is to make the martial arts conference seem smooth after the sorcerer has not appeared on a large scale, and the second is to consider someone in the opponent. It is impossible to control the martial arts in an instant, and it is difficult to make a fool of the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the holder of the hunting license, he was naturally in the third line of defense - in fact, he is responsible for monitoring not only the suspicious in the field Characters, including those who participated in the martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there was no new clue to the hiding place of the demon, Roland had some regrets, but he had no better way. It is already the most feasible practice to arrange the traps waiting for the other party to collide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he knows more than the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon is not simply attracted to the "natural power." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What drives them to act is the will from the realm of the gods. Their ultimate goal is to destroy the dream world and attribute all magic to the ideology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is a chance to get so many cores at once, and the enemy should not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the corner of the corridor, a woman’s figure suddenly appeared in front of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly felt that the scalp was tight, and the other person was not, but he was the last person he wanted to meet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The genius of the association is a martial artist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...is you." She seemed to have noticed Roland and looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two of them in the empty corridor. If you pretend that you didn’t see it too hard at this time, he had to clear his throat and smile. "Do you cough, hello."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the other person’s next sentence made his smile stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I haven’t thanked you for the last time." She took the initiative and said nothing, "Thank you for killing." That weird monster rescued everyone from the crisis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately, the association has pushed all the credit to my head..." Fiji sighed and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no, it’s fine," he said quickly. "Actually... I have to hide my identity for some special reasons. The less people notice The better I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's okay," the other person unexpectedly did not go deeper, but responded quickly, "Since you say that, Then I took it as a gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a surprise in Roland’s heart, why did Fiji’s cold accept this remark so calmly? ? If she still remembers what happened before the coma, then she must not forget the voice of the spirit. Can look at her attitude, clearly want to skip this general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the previous contacts and the wind reviews he has heard, the other party is not a big jealous person, or even the opposite – and all young Like genius, Fiji is arrogant and discerning. The demands on himself and others are extremely high. The talks are often filled with chills that refuse to be thousands of miles away. It is by no means a good martial artist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the performance of the other party is completely opposite to the image in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," the Fiji language is suddenly thinking of something, and asked casually, "What kind of encyclopedia do you think a history bout will like?" Books?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned, “What do you ask for this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Remember The survivor from the Kajid Peninsula that we visited last time?” she explained. “Miss Wakiris, she is now a member of my team. I was worried that she was too bored during her recovery. I didn't expect her interest to be a book--in this month, she almost turned over the library's history books."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You Still worried about others? Roland secretly smacked his mouth and was preparing to speak. Suddenly an electric light flashed through his mind, and the cold hair behind him stood up! Wait, she said Wakiris, isn't that the devil who had known each other in the memory fragments? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This month, the other party is constantly reading, and all history books? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...from start to finish?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, especially the history of war. Interesting It’s good, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it just a coincidence? Roland’s thoughts turned sharply, and when he got to his lips, he changed his mouth temporarily. “Really... I think it should be an encyclopedia about humanities and society. Sorry, I still have the task of guarding the account, now I have to go. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this topic was interrupted a bit, the Fijian language did not reveal any dissatisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Me too." She nodded. "Goodbye, Mr. Roland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ...Goodbye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the other party turned and left, Roland sank into the water and strode downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace is getting faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished the cold and stopped listening to the footsteps that gradually drifted away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "single encounter" is not a coincidence, but the result of her deliberate choice of timing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, Roland has always been the most difficult point to confirm in her speculation. He is different from Wajilis. If it is not that, she can’t find it. Any flaws in the other side - for example, when he visited the last time, he took out his mobile phone three times a minute, his eyes would stay for one or two seconds on a pretty woman, and the preferred cola when choosing a drink... everything is common with this era. People are no different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also makes the "other world" idea have an unexplained contradiction - since Wakiris knows Roland, it means they are from the same A world, but why is there such a big difference between the two? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
