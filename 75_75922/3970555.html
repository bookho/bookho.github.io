			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, Lightning, Wendy, McMug and Hummingbird are performing the final blow before the total attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the main guns of the battleship fired solid bullets, the damage to the combatants and defensive facilities at the top of the city wall was not ideal, so their targets were destroying the enemy. The defense line set up in the city head, as much as possible to kill the enemy has a living force, for the total attack to open up a safe passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the first time that the hydrogen balloon has been put into actual combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the thousands of miles of raids five months ago, the takeoff was on the canal side, and almost everyone witnessed the ascension of this behemoth - in Roland In the plan, the unimpeded hydrogen balloon can be used as a short-range bomber in this era. In addition, the entire fleet provides logistical support, which is completely the original version of the aircraft carrier combat mode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army soldiers on the pier burst into a warm cheer, and they all knew that no enemy could stop the blow from the sky, and their wise and merciful lords would surely Will win the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, the hydrogen balloon floated over the king’s capital, and the hustle and bustle of the city shrank to the size of the palm. Lightning pulled down the windshield glasses and fired at Wendy. The gesture, the latter a little bit, twirling the organ. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bomb slammed out of the bracket and fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the previous air strikes, this time Anna did not accompany the ship, but instead replaced the hummingbird. Under the constant influence of her magic, the four bombs that are suspended will not only be out of contact, but the weight will be only 20% of the usual time. This enchantment is a new method that she has realized in the context of increasingly sophisticated control. If the effect is maintained for a very short period of time, the weight of multiple contact objects can be changed at the same time, and the magic consumption is indirectly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning easily caught up with the bomb and guided it to the slinger on the side of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the air, the little girl saw the horrified eyes of the knights on the wall. They raised their bows and muskets and shot them in the air, trying to shoot themselves down, but she Clearly, it is difficult to hit a bird flying freely in the air, not to mention that most weapons simply do not reach the height of her separation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bomb went straight to the trebuchet, and with a loud bang, a red fireball suddenly lit up and quickly expanded, and the surrounding crowd could not escape In the blink of an eye, it was swallowed up by flames. The violent swells swept through everything on the wall, and the boiled oil pan was turned over to the ground, quickly igniting the fire. The flame then ignited with the hot oil and ignited the explosive charge stacked on the side. The sound of the explosion sounded one after another, and everything around it was smashed. There were flames and smoke everywhere. The knights who were still preparing to fight in the past moments fled in an instant. Many people lost their way in the smoke and rolled straight down. The city wall; some people are struggling in the sea of ​​fire, rolling around and trying to put out the flames on their bodies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city has now become a human purgatory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their defenses have collapsed," looking at the smoked kings The wall, the look of Sylvie, showed a little bit of tolerance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This group of people deserves to be guilty," said the nightingale with a blank expression. "If we fail, they will only intensify."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, someone has to pay for this dispute, not the enemy, it is us," Roland said with ease, then waved his hand toward the iron axe behind him. "Blow the horn." , take the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not want to sigh at the time of the cruelty of war, or to remember the value of peace, this is the struggle for power, survival War is a collision between ideas and classes. When a backward class is replaced, it has never been silently retired from the stage, and it will always require a lot of blood to end it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He prefers that these blood come from the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "War for you, Your Highness!" The latter made a clean and tidy military ceremony and left the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the horn of the total attack resounded over the dock area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
