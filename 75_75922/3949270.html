			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first batch of free people who served as cannon fodder did not receive any resistance and had climbed up the slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An angle with the slope, the wooden fence pointing to the sky blocked their steps. The fence is not blocked, but leaves a gap for the spear to pass through. When the attacker destroys the log, the defender simply stands behind the fence and can use the spear to kill the opponent. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Duke of Fran was somewhat surprised that the people who were still standing on the wall were also missing, and the entire periphery was currently unguarded. The leading troops quickly cut a few gaps with a small axe, and after dumping a few round logs, everyone rushed to the city. After a while, the wood gate was also put down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are going," the Duke shook the reins and led the remaining troops to the gate. From the beginning of the siege to the gate of the city, it was less than two quarters of an hour, what is Garcia Wimbledon doing? Fran frowned. Some people with a little combat experience know that when leaving the city, they must leave a group of guards, or hire a courageous person who is not afraid of death. Go to the city to stop the enemy's offensive and try to give The retreating large forces are fighting for time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three kings are not stupid people, otherwise it is impossible to make the entire Southland go to her so quickly. Why didn't she arrange a group of defensive walls? A strong defense, a dexterous trap, no one to operate, it will only be a dead object. The Duke of Fran thought about it and decided to let the guards enter the city first and explore the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of the captain’s return are still the same, and no resistance is encountered in the city, but some streets are indeed blocked by wood and masonry, and his subordinates are already convening local The people clear the obstacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fran no longer hesitated, rate the remaining troops into the Eagle City. I am also a veteran who has been with Wimbledon III for many years and can't be caught by a little girl. However, Tefco has made some mistakes in this move. If he can wait until he has captured the city gate and walks through the city directly, he can save a lot of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When passing through the gate, the Duke smelled a pungent smell, not the carrion that often appeared on the battlefield, but rather like pine nuts and oranges. a mixture of skin and incense. If you take a deep breath, you may even feel a bit fragrant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this taste? He looked around and found no abnormalities. However, the ditch for the drainage of the earth wall was blocked, and the sewage flowed out of the channel and slowly flowed along the ground. Those dirty accumulations don't know how long it has been over, black, reflecting the colorful light in the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the smell of this pile of sewage, Fran shook his head and led the team to the castle area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you took the Eagle City, you have to go to the Lord’s Castle and the City Hall to see if there is anything you can take. Of course, the city is likely to have been searched by Garcia, Golden Dragon may not stay, but some of the larger crafts and decorations are also very suitable as a trophy. The haulage truck brought by myself is slightly cleaned up and used for loading and collecting. As for the mercenaries, it is estimated that they have already gone to shops and farms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take them, anyway, the Duke of Joey is dead, and the next successor is still a problem. At this point, it is a matter of tightness to grab the city from the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After visiting the Lord's Castle, Fran Chelit found something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is space in the castle, he thought, not just the coins, there is nothing left in the entire basement with cloth and grain storage. There were a few places where murals were left, leaving only blank walls, no books in the bookcase, and even the big bed in the master bedroom was missing, and the whole castle was like a light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this something that can be done in a hurry? Fran’s heart was faintly faint. If you didn’t move these things from the beginning, the castle could not be searched so thoroughly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when he wanted to go to the city hall to look at it, the North Gate suddenly raised a thick black smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened, is it a fire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, adult, I already Called Molly to see it," said the captain. "Maybe the enemy deliberately set fire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
