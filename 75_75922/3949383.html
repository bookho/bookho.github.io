			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding that there was a cure for the evil affair there, Tassa’s restless mood finally calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once something is going to be busy, the next few days seem to have gone a lot faster. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to visiting the winery estates in the suburbs, he developed the route of the convoy, and recorded the terrain of the Canal Dock to the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of trouble to enter the king city now, because of the reasons of the people outside the city, the kings’ gates have been closed, prohibiting outsiders from entering – especially knowing After the church is distributing the holy medicine, every day a desperate crowd hits the city gate, hoping to go to the church for treatment, and the guards on the wall don’t hesitate to respond with a bow. Now the gate has accumulated a lot of bodies in the hot sun. An unpleasant smell is emitted under the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only open side door is limited to aristocrats and merchants who deliver food. Fortunately, Tassa has served in the patrol for quite a long time, and is also Wangcheng local. People, most of the guards know him, and only say hello when coming in and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, the connection between the city and the outside has been almost interrupted, even if the fugitives are transported at the docks, the news is difficult to pass to the city, let alone For the upper aristocrats, they are eager to take away all the refugees in the East, which may be detonated at any time. The province will also concentrate the patrols to suppress the riots. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa probably understands the mood of His Royal Highness on the day of receiving the letter. These people have been abandoned by the king. If the church sends a priest out of the city to distribute the holy medicine, I am afraid that most of the fugitives will become devout believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If His Royal Highness can take this group of people before the church, bring them to their majesty and bring them a place to be reborn and live, no doubt they will become His Royal Highness. Fanatic supporters. On the morning of the fourth day, the returning fleet arrived at the Canal Dock on time. Tassa was surprised to find that there were as many as 300 soldiers in the First Army sent by His Royal Highness. Basically replaced the wheel rifle. With this powerful team as a guarantee, even if the church knows the news, it is estimated that it is unable to stop the fugants from leaving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning!" Margaret, who was waiting at the dock, saw the little girl and couldn’t wait to go up and hug her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is...?" asked the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The owner of the Wangdu Chamber of Commerce, Ms. Margaret." Tassa said, "All the boats needed for this shipment are contacted and provided by her." She has contributed a lot to the plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out," the iron axe nodded to her, "Thank you for your help." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This fee will be deducted from my Highness," she shrugged. "And thank you, thank you, lightning."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning smashed his head, "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, nothing," Taza coughed twice. What are you going to do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Set up a camp in the south of the terminal, while controlling the dock area, and rescue in the afternoon." Iron Axe said, "If you ship, then Please, please."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Brian led his men into the refugee area, he could not bear it. Live frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dying patients everywhere, the skin of the body is bleeding black blood and pus, causing flies to swarm, but they have no strength to drive away Let these flying insects crawl and crawl on their bodies and eat blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but think of the demon moon, the people in Bianbu Town are trapped in the slums of the fortress, and in the face of hunger and cold erosion, it is also powerless. If this is what the church does, it is an unforgivable crime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get together and move," Brian said. "Look at you, Miss Echo."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian only saw that she opened her mouth and did not make any noise, and some of the fugitives had come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, a group of people ran over and stumbled. "Adult, are you all true? As long as you can cure this disease, I am willing to follow You go to the West!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become, Brian’s heart is happy, "Of course, our boat has stopped in the dock area, bring your family, follow me Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other soldiers also stepped forward to help the patient who was lying on the ground unable to move. The team instantly expanded to a few hundred people and walked toward the canal pier. Many people noticed this scene and followed it. Back at the dock, the First Army soldiers had placed the bag with purified water on a long table, and the entrance to the trestle on the ship was led by the iron axe. Only one person was allowed at a time to ensure that all the shippers drank. Purified water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone listened, these water bags contain medicines for treatment. Just drink it and you will be cured immediately." The long table was set up. A platform with famous soldiers standing on it, constantly preaching the manuscript of His Royal Highness. "The so-called "evil plague is caused by witches, only holy drugs can be removed" is simply nonsense. They just want to earn more. Coins, let you also thank you for your help. And Roland, not only brings the potion, but also does not charge any fees! That's right, a copper eagle doesn't need it! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a commotion in the crowd, and the first person who drank the purified water quickly felt the changes in the body. He did not dare Confidence in the clothes, watching the dark spots quickly faded, "This medicine is really effective! I am fine, I am fine! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am also, the god is on, the wound is not bleeding!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God? where is it? I only saw a bunch of scammers! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That's right, this medicine has nothing to do with the church! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live down to Roland! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As more people recover, the reaction of the people is getting more and more excited. If the soldiers of the First Army are not in control, they are afraid of the length of the water bag. The table will be rushed by the fugitives immediately.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now Ronaldinho is exploring the West and needs a lot of manpower to cultivate the fields, build houses, build roads... he does not charge The cost of the potion does not force you to go to the West. "The soldiers responsible for propaganda continue to sing high," but His Royal Highness promised that as long as he is willing to travel to the West, he will get food, shelter and pay for him! No matter what your strengths, you can get a matching job! Willing people, take a step forward, follow the mercenary on board, and head to the new home! It doesn't matter if you don't want to, so we can help us to leave after three days. The food for these three days is also provided free by the caravan! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really have a place to live and have a salary?" Someone asked aloud.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is the condition that His Royal Highness said!" The soldier nodded and responded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please let me go on board, I am willing to work for my Highness!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Me too! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And me, adults! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a blacksmith! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian is delighted to see that this batch of hundreds of people No one chose to stay in Wangdu, but all boarded the sailboat to the west. A ship immediately set off after the full load, and the follow-up airships continued to follow, without any pause under the command of Margaret.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Brian continued to travel to and from the refugee camps and docks, relying on the echo of the sounds to draw a batch of people from the east, and control the number of people each time. Within three or four hundred people. Just when he returned to the dock with a new recruit, the patient suddenly saw the first army stationed in the wheat field in the south. A small team rushed to the north bank of the canal. The gun is already in the hand.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? He asked the men of the iron axe.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
