			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sinking into the sea to sleep for a while, wake up and move on; thirsty to drink a few mouthfuls of rain, hungry to catch two fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day Joan has no idea how long it has been. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first she tried to record time based on day and night changes, but after missing one or two times, the error went from day to week, and then from week to month... now She doesn't know how long she has been swimming, but... at least for half a year? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he thought of this, Joan would succumb to crying. In fact, she also cried many times, but the tears soon merged into the sea and turned into the sea. portion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can’t relax on the sea when you sleep, because it will attract the Osprey or other predator, even if you can’t eat her, it will hurt if you eat it. A few days, not to mention the possibility of being hit by sea ghosts and those monster sea ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the past six months, Joan has met with the enemy several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time she feels scared out of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, she can always get rid of each other with speed, although sometimes she will accidentally add two or three wounds to her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scales that have been praised are now more damaged, and the exposed skin is like a weird white spot. Due to the fact that it has been soaked in water, some wounds have already become corrupt. What's even worse is that the parasites treated her as a new host, carrying a carapace at her wounds and getting home, and every time I pulled it down, I felt a pain in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This body is not pretty, but now it looks even more ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She misses the soft bed of the winter city and the arms of Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember the unfettered life without worrying about safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also there are a lot of fish that can be eaten in the sea, but they can only be eaten raw. It’s obviously nothing to do before, but now I always feel the smell of the mouth. Not going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to eat chicken wings with lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about Joan will cry out, but even if the tears do not stop, she did not stop the swing of the tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However...How long does it take to travel back to the original point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is faster than most fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the snow winds under the shackles are far behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the approximate time, her journey to the present should be enough to go back and forth from the winter to the Shadow Islands five times, but why the front still does not see To the end? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What world is round, your majesty...will not lie to her? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Roland’s majesty deceives her, she will have the opportunity to see him later, so she must... shave his face with scales! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, that must be seen before...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan took a deep breath, Give yourself a breath, never give up! She wants to go back to everyone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of "吖-吖-吖-" sounds are floating on the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the same echo came from afar, "吖-吖-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Joan trembled and looked incredulously in the direction of the sound source - today's weather is not too good, the sea is always misty, visibility is less than a few kilometers, it is like a shadow in the low tide The islands are average. Seeing that nothing was found, she violently swam in that direction for a few minutes, finally capturing a black outline in the mist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan couldn’t help but have a heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that because of the visual effects, many seemingly inconspicuous objects in the sea are actually giants. Being able to stand on the surface like a reef, it will not be small, and it can be a big mountain. And the mountains have appeared, will the land be far behind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to see what you see, it’s the desperate mountain range? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonton felt a lot of strength in his body. She puts the speed to the limit, shoots a series of splashes on the sea, and rushes toward the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the distance draws closer, the black outline under the mist gradually emerges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed a mountain, but the mountain is not a western port, but a flat island. The back of the island seems to be connected to the wider continent, but the two are too far apart to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, land is better than nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe played a 12-point spirit and swam the nearest beach on the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After landing, she noticed that the island is probably a bit bigger than the largest island in the fjord, except for the lush flat-topped high mountains. In addition, there is almost no ups and downs, and it is flat like a grassland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is indeed a grassland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the barren islands of Joan’s impression, it seems that it is completely unaffected by the salty sea breeze and various harsh weather conditions. The grass, occasionally mixed with one or two blooming flowers. She couldn't imagine a place where the tsunami could destroy all the vegetation and why. Together with the fog surrounding the island, there is a sense of a fairyland isolated from the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tail fin was turned into a pair of legs, and Joan slowly walked toward the center of the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, there were some stone monuments on the grass. She didn’t care at first, but in a short while, these stone monuments were neat, but they were all neat. Arranged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the closer to the center of the island, the more stone monuments, even rounded into a circle around the back, and a little bit inward, as if around What is erected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene, she seems to have seen it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe is in front of a stone monument Come down, look at the monument carefully - there are traces of chiseling on it, but it is a pattern that is hand-drawn, or a meaningful text, Joan can not identify. But to her surprise, these stones are filled with old-fashioned atmosphere, which does not cover too much dust, as if it is often taken care of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does... Who lives on this island? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not too far away, and Joan suddenly slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a huge pothole in front of her eyes. The square is probably a few kilometers wide. The inside of the hole is not deep, and the arc of the edge is incomparable. Smooth, not a natural collapse can be formed. And the stone monuments are arranged in layers around the tiankeng, forming a "corrugation" that spreads out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She vaguely remembered something and looked up into the sky--the fog of the moon, the outline of the red moon is still clearly identifiable. It is obvious that one is at the top of the dome and one is at the foot. The size of the two is very similar, as if it were a mold. She even came up with a weird idea. If the red moon falls, should it just fill the hole? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello." Just then, a beautiful voice came from behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"吖————!" Joanton was shocked and screamed, turned and slammed back two steps, and hit a stone tablet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter also seemed to be shocked. He couldn’t speak for a long time. It took a long time for him to say, "That... you are alright. ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
