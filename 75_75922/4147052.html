He played with the other side of the hair. It’s easy to say, “In this way, they should also be obedient to you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The Ministry of Industry can finally add more people,” Anna smiled. Tao, "I just don't know what their actual level is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be aware of the value of the book, at least the talent will not be bad." Roland Shrugging, thinking that in the past, he relied on a row of redox formula to deceive the chief alchemist to the winter city, "and willing to bring the family to the pressure, the curiosity should be considered strong... These two conditions, only given the right opportunity, I think they will not be silent all the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he paused here, "Of course, in Before you officially assist you, they have to complete the basic subjects before they can learn. To arrange, this is also a process of establishing the relationship between the superior and the subordinate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna is closer, leaning her head on his chest," Honestly, I don't know if I can lead them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to be the Minister of Industry, but you offered it," Roland teased. "Why, Now it’s not the commander of the light pole, but the market is gone?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached out and the slender black fire whispered from the fingertips, circled in front of Roland Circle, "Do you want to be tied up by the black fire and tickle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃--I mean, if you have any place you don’t understand, It’s good to ask Tilly.” Roland opened his eyes. “I heard that those in the college are not afraid of the majesty of the princess.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Anna’s eyes lit up. “Yes, I can go to your sister to ask! But...” She hesitated. “I haven’t talked to her for a long time. I heard that since the last expedition, her emotions have been..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, it’s been so long, she must have adjusted." Roland said comfortably. "Maybe you go to talk to her, she will be very happy too - after all, you used to have a test paper." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a possibility that the ashes may be resurrected. He did not disclose it to people other than Tilly. The main reason is that they are worried about their lives in the war." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Anna nodded as determined. "That's it!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the crisis, Roland changed the subject. "Right, how is the Rubik's-driven steam truck project going?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first prototype will take a few days to complete, the structure is roughly the same as the previous Rubik's cube, and the handling and powertrain are simplified, though The degree of flexibility has dropped a lot, but the reliability has improved a lot. As soon as I mentioned the business, Anna’s tone immediately became serious. “There is no problem in using it to load goods and people. The premise is that the road project you said can be completed smoothly. If it is just a general dirt road and mountain road, it basically has no way. start running. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the tractor? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is far worse," Anna shook her head. "The drawings you handed me were not detailed enough. Many places need to be actually done to know, and Suspension and control systems are different from wheeled vehicles, and it may take a long time to build a qualified prototype. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the most lacking is time now.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s defensive, the devil will only The more difficult it is to deal with, and the desire to get rid of the reliance on positional warfare, the armored force is undoubtedly the most suitable choice. However, the drawings of this old large machinery are not very well collected, unlike the ready-made products like textbooks, even in In the dream world, he can only find some scattered details of the parts. It is not accurate to say whether it is possible to match each other.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you apply modernity directly Parts, the winter-free craftsmanship is far from the standard. Whether it is a crawler tractor or an armored vehicle that has been modified on this basis, it is considered a consumable item, and it is impossible to let Anna all make it.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
