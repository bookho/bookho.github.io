			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, the Eleanor Floating Island completed its last replenishment at the Cliff Terminal and flew to the hinterland of Twilight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farewell to it is the nearly 100,000 inhabitants of the Winter City - people are on the streets, climbing the roof, and even boarding the desolate mountains, just to witness this history The moment of sex. The entire city was crowded with people, and once again set a record for the number of people in the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only part of the winterless population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More people are busy in factories, ports and farmland, and participate in the expedition in another way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also on the same day, the total population of the border area and the Changge District officially broke through the million mark, of which more than 50% came from the wolf heart and the eternal winter. Although they are not as unconceived as the early movers, they can still feel the unparalleled shock from the raging crowd and the extraordinary significance of this day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the neat salute, Eleanor first went along the mountains to the long song fortress, then turned to the west, gradually drifting away, and finally disappeared. In the eyes of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the atmosphere of the residents’ upswing has not been suspended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tracking report of "Graycast Weekly" made newspaper sales a new high. Whether it is the streets or the streets, everyone's topic is inseparable from this attack. Gradually, the days of departure have a common name, which people call it Miracle Day, which represents the beginning of human conquest of the sky. This is also the second event that was named after the miracle building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the floating island is much calmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the initial fresh energy, the engineering team continued to invest in intense and orderly work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true for the Cavaliers. Except for the reconnaissance units that are routinely released, all trainees must take off at least one trip per day to familiarize themselves with the surrounding terrain. Huge floating islands, busy landing areas and smoldering kiln areas form a unique spectacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you feel comfortable with this new body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating Island In the core area, Roland stood at the bottom of the pit and looked at Eleanor, who was firmly tied to the stone pillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this month, not only the stone pillars have grown a lot, but the mother has also grown a lot of tentacles, falling into the mud under the feet, like rooting plants. In general - according to her, these tentacles can provide her with additional perception to better control the floating island. In a sense, the floating island is the body and the tentacles are her nerves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s much better than before." Eleanor’s voice was brisk. "Can see, hear, think, have these three points." What's so dissatisfied? I'm already a lot lucky compared to Elena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three-seat adults, you are heavy." Pasha hangs down The Lord said, "Everyone knows that no one can survive without your active integration. Not to mention that you didn't know that there would be such a day, this guts enough -"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am talking about results, not processes." Eleanor interrupted her. "I believe that the sisters who were willing to dedicate themselves to the federation are more than me. I am just robbing. It was the first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that her status is really good, Roland thought. He had always been worried before. A witch who had fought the devil for decades turned into a devil, and would cause psychological problems. But now, Eleanor's heart is very mature, and there is nothing to worry about his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know what you are thinking," Eleanor suddenly turned the subject back to him. "I'm afraid I can't think of being autistic? If it's in the world." I am alone, maybe it will be like this. But everyone is now basically, the prospects for war are better than four hundred years ago, and there are so many new knowledge to learn, how can we work hard to be autistic?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...Learning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The federation can become a human ruler, not just It is by ability. At that time, it was also ours to master the most advanced technologies and ideas. It is not an exaggeration to say that it is three representatives. Now that the glory of the Federation is no longer there, it is still necessary to learn by keeping up with the progress of the times. To achieve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
