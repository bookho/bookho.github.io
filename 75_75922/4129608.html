			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, that is dawn dawn!" someone shouted on the side of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The one running in the first place!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the reminder of an eye-catching woman, there was a stir in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really he! Since I was not a teacher, I thought I would never see him again.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, he looked at me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Florin teacher, please come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a handsome, tall man appearing at the end of the field of vision, although he looked quite tired, but still keeps on the steps, firmly in the first position. What makes everyone even more enamored is that whenever someone cheers for him, he will smile as much as possible. Whenever the students meet, they will wave their hands. This gentle and gentle person will instantly capture the hearts of all supporters. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all this is seen in the eyes of the honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling Hilter, the Cavaliers family was born, the former middle school teacher of the Ministry of Education, and later transferred to the General Staff Department, has a reputation as dawn dawn. Um... If he wins the championship, how do you write the title of the report? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Shocked! A man without a winter city has made thousands of women unable to extricate themselves. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... Are you asking me?" Vader stepping on the bicycle panted. "Is this a thousand, will it be a little too much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this witch and the temper are no different from the little girl, he does not dare to have a slight contempt. As the central figure of the Propaganda Department, her top boss is the king of the Grey Fort, who has been on the peak of power, and I heard that it has a very close relationship with the Lord of the Witch Alliance, Lord Wendy. If you treat such a person as a little girl, you must be yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide at the bottom of the patrol team for several years, Vader naturally will not make such a low-level mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the other party found himself and asked to take a free ride to watch the entire game, he did not hesitate to agree. Anyway, when Carter is not there, he will also help deal with the police affairs, such as this team leader's work - just one person is just a little effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the reason for his enthusiasm is a little more than the background of honey. The Security Bureau wants to make achievements, and all the threats that threaten the majesty and the security of the kingdom are in the nascent stage. It is necessary to have as much detailed information as possible, and this is what the other party is good at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So no matter which aspect, it is necessary to make this witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't care too much about the details," Honey snorted. "If you see this title at first glance, would you like to see it immediately?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think." Vader replied honestly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it." The little girl whispered cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, different voices suddenly appeared in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that the man behind the teacher of Feilin is also very... very good." A lady covered her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You also noticed? I think he is much better than dawn dawn." Her words immediately caused a hot discussion among the people around me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know him! The chief knight of His Majesty the King, Carter Lannes! You see the cloak behind him, with a royal emblem on it!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that it is the Lord Knight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you are still too young, such a talent is more attractive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, he caught up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Refueling, the Cavaliers--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter Lannis, born in the same Cavaliers family, once belonged to the Knights of the Kings The regiment, followed by the four princes moved to Bianbu Town, is one of the oldest start-ups. His skills are agile, his military power is extraordinary, and even folks have the ability to compete with the extraordinary witches, and it is also the most popular candidate for the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honey while listening to the message from the bird, while recording the game live on the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Carter's constant acceleration, the distance between the two is shortening a little bit, and soon there is a trend of moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of refueling has also changed from the previous side to mutual support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the previous title has to be changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of thinking, honey dropped the pen with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——“Where is the flower, belongs to the grievances between the two men”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter felt like burning in the lungs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to allow Mey to recognize himself at first sight, he wore bright ribbons and cloaks, but the original light and incomparable decoration was like a mountain at the moment. Heavy, especially when running in the wind, he even thought that these things seemed to pull the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he still does not want to take off the decoration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was made by Mey for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter wants to be able to wear them through the finish line - just before dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mey never mentioned it to him, he heard some old memories from the members of the troupe - he has not moved to the West under Roland At the time, the film had already been famous for long songs. At that time, the dawn of dawn and the star of the West were almost everyone's praise. Everyone thought that the two would come together, and his wife seemed to have been fascinated by the film for a while, but the final result was a Misunderstanding, film always likes the theater newcomer Irene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the matter was not over, Cocattle still had some resentment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about Xiaochen Chenguang? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will look at each other, but because the better ones have not yet appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to prove to those people that he is the best person for Mey! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to do is to beat the filmer of the same knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter is full of strength, staring at less than half of his opponents, once again speeding up the pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The viewing platform at the end is gradually appearing in the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time to win a game! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a sudden footstep behind him -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone else can catch up now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this possible! One hour after the start of the game, he and the film left everyone behind. Even if you want to save your strength, you shouldn't wait until this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that the sprint is much more expensive than running at a constant speed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter looked back in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
