			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia nodded and divided the wheat into the upper class of the Witch Alliance, and an ugly but extremely powerful image of the behemoth came to mind. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...what is the stone of God's punishment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that once the opponent uses the stone After that, my ability will be greatly limited, and it is difficult to make a full transformation. In the face of the general desert warrior, it is better to say, but the extraordinary person like the ashes basically has no chance of winning. What's more, the other party can take the initiative to wear the stone, and the strange ability has no meaning in front of her, so the ashes should be the peak of the force without the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the latter did not answer immediately, but was silent and began to speak. "If there is such a person, her strength and speed are no worse than extraordinary." There is almost unlimited life expectancy. Any injury will not affect her performance. Even if it suffers a fatal blow, it can be restored to the original. How strong do you think?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a warrior in a long battlefield, she naturally knows the importance of combat skills and experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most difficult thing in the sacred duel is not the young warriors of the twenties and twenty years old, but the tribal backbones of those who are around 30 years old. They generally serve as mentors and reviewers in the clan, teaching their own experience and tactics to the younger generation. In terms of strength, they are not inferior to young people, and the understanding of the battle between life and death cannot be underestimated. However, by the age of forty, the body will become sluggish due to the increase of age, and the accumulated dark injuries will gradually deteriorate. Although the skills are more sophisticated, they can no longer play as freely as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s enough to be envious of a painless injury, and it’s because there is no witch in the winter city that can heal any injuries, she decided to go. Where is the further tempering of its own strength, not to mention the endless life span? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has nothing to do with his own talents and will. If someone can be as long as the ashes say, as long as the time is long enough, she will become the most outstanding sooner or later. The warrior - this kind of opponent thinks that people feel scared... wrong, it is exciting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there such a person in the winter city?" Luo Jia could not wait to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A witch named Felice." Ashes replied, "I haven’t officially tried it with her, just..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was practicing swords in the castle garden, she happened to pass by, and then made two suggestions. After I practiced according to her statement, I found that the shots were indeed more fluid." The superb witch said slowly. "Unfortunately, I didn't take long to board the boat and leave the winter city. I haven't had time to discuss more with her." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just look aside?" Luo Jia’s tail is shaking faster, even if he is a rich and experienced instructor, he also needs to fight. In order to be able to pinpoint the inadequacies of the apprentices – this is why the big clan will build a dedicated performance field. The smaller the gap between opponents, the higher the difficulty of pointing. Ashes is undoubtedly a powerful warrior, but can only directly find defects by visual inspection? It is a top warrior who broke through the age limit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Felice is the strongest person without Winter City. After all, when I really set foot on the battlefield, no one can put expectations on the opponent without wearing God. On the stone of punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes that are also unaffected by the gods are the second strongest - the infinite life can be seen as the miracle of the three gods, this There is no way to force it. In the mind of the wolf woman, this powerful figure like a mountain is already worth pursuing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what about herself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia is looking forward to this trip to the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ashes didn’t end the topic—the other person seemed to see through her thoughts, and the strange smile appeared on her face again. The extraordinary person patted her shoulder, and the tone was faint. "Yes, I forgot to tell you, there are more than a hundred witches like Felice in the winter city."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
