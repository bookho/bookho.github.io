			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, you don't have to accompany me." The echo walked by the Chishui River, and the snow under his feet made a creaking sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The city is not safe, this is not the town of Bentham," the iron axe walked behind her, keeping it at a distance of two steps, "and the Highness has commanded If you leave the castle and there are no other witches around, I should protect your safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know him before I know," she said. Exporting white gas, "In addition, you don't need to use honorific words for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In my heart, you will always be the patriarch of the Aosha clan, Zall. Silver Moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "Aosha" is mentioned, the echo is silent, although the iron axe can't see her expression, but can feel the other's mood. Some are low, he wants to comfort the last two sentences, but he does not know where to start, he can only close his mouth and silently follow her slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the Chishui River in the wild, this tributary is almost in a straight line after entering the city. The river banks on both sides are paved with bricks and stones. And neat. Every few dozen steps, there will be a ladder leading to the river, probably for people to take water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow today is not too big, and occasionally one or two pedestrians can be encountered on the road. Whether it is a man or a woman, they will be surprised to see the echo - obviously, Silver Moon's tall figure and light brown skin are a bit special, plus the blue-gray long hair, which is particularly eye-catching – in the hinterland of the Grey Fort, it is rare to see pure-blooded sand people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go to the other side," echoes obviously don't like to be looked at by people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founding an arch bridge, the two carefully passed through the already frozen Bridge deck, come to the east side of the fortress. There are almost few houses to be seen here, and the farmland is covered with snow, and all of them are flat. The blue wall in the distance is in the shadow of the snow, and it forms a stark contrast with the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tiesha City can't see such a scene." Echoed with emotion, "I didn't leave the South, I thought the whole continent was a look, except The sand is still outside the sand, and the water source and the oasis are the resources that must be used for life. But here, no one will be the blood of the Chishui River, and when you want to drink water, you will fall down."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they will bleed for something else," said the iron axe. "Golden dragons, gems, honors, status... nowhere to escape."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why...you can tell me at night, she believes that His Highness can stop the dispute," she looked up and looked at the gray sky. "Whether it is a sandman or a mainland kingdom, whether it is ordinary People or witches can enjoy resources and live freely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...I don't know," Iron Axie hesitated for a moment, he really I can't imagine that everyone will leave the gap and live together, even if they are under the command of the Highness. The power of the gods who, it could not be done - he undoubtedly can conquer all enemies, but he can make an enemy willing to accept their rule it? Regardless of the means used by His Royal Highness, the seeds of hatred have been planted in the process of conquest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to go back to Iron Sands City?" The echo suddenly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Silver Moon," the iron axe came back and replied without hesitation, "I have vowed to the Three Gods, always for Roland The mainstay of Wimbledon is the mainstay, and he opened up the territory for him. But you can rest assured that since he promised to avenge you, he will do it in the future. When you return to Tiesha City, no one dares to treat you. Disrespectful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't want to be the patriarch of the Aosha clan again," she whispered. "I like to stay in evergreen places, like With Wendy and the nightingale, I like to teach my songs by His Highness. I hope that one day I can go back and have a look, but I don’t want to live in the desert and fight for the water."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, you are the only Aosha clan successor in my mind. Iron Axie did not say what he said, but bowed his head. "No one can force you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two crossed the white fields and walked into an open area, and the echo stopped. "Let's practice here, it should Will not bother others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
