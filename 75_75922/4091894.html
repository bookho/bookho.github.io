			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1, 2, 3, 4..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia put the golden dragon in the bag Falling on the table, carefully counted twice, the brow could not help but close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than half a month, she used three-quarters of her savings, and at this rate, another week or two, she I have to go back to the government and throw my own ambitions into the quicksand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of a big city is too exaggerated! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the Evelyn’s savory wine house, it’s just that! Even if a group of robbers robbed the knife, they didn't have them... then...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, Luo Jia frustrated and sighed, making a whimper. The ears also hang down. They did not know how to rob, but they honestly took Jinlong out of the bag and were willing to hand it over to the other party. In particular, the owner of the wine house has repeatedly expressed concern that she is too expensive and has advised her several times. She also said that she can receive a bottle of no-cost drink every month as long as she joins the Witch Alliance. She did not listen to her heart at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is her desire to lose to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This really can’t blame her, that chaotic drink is like magic In general, even Chen Lu of the Atula Oasis is not so delicious - she can't even find words to describe their taste, but without exception, the drink of each color is unparalleled. To the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is only a single species, even if it is the wine of the Three Gods, she also has the confidence to control herself. After all, the right amount of alcohol is good for the military, and the excess is equal to the self-destruction. It is. The chaotic drink is too much change. She can't help but want to try what it tastes like a cup. Unconsciously, Jinlong is just like a running water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia annoyedly turned his head to the left and right, rubbing his forehead with the icy tabletop, trying to wake himself up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you can't go on like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as she stays in the city, she does not want to go to the wine house to look at it - to be honest, apart from the expensive drinks, it is really a development. A good place for vision and intelligence gathering. Just looking for a place to sit down, she can hear conversations from businessmen from all over the North, and unlike the travel vendors in the extreme South, most of them are worth the price, and the things they talk about are quite fresh, which can be said to benefit her. Shallow. Another point is that she can occasionally encounter the same kind, so that she can understand the inside story of some witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the remaining savings have not allowed her to continue to wait for the opportunity to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She must take action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome this desire, going out of town is the most effective choice. Farewell to no winter city can keep her away from the Baiwei wine house, and fighting can make her forget everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf girl closed her eyes and could not help but reveal the long road of sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this must also be the challenge that the Three Gods gave her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, she feels that she has revived a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patted his cheek, Luo Jia took Jinlong’s income, rolled over and packed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two weeks, she did not spend all of her time in the Baiwei Liquor. First, she visited the savior Nana W. Pine, through the ashes. And I learned an important news: there are no three witches with healing power in the winter city, namely Nana, Lily and the leaves. Instead of being exclusive to the Grand Chief, they open a medical home where local residents can get treatment at a cost—this cost is much cheaper than a chaotic drink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
