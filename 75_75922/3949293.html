"His Royal Highness, do you need me to help you relax?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "There are more than 30 people who need to deal with it, let's wait." Roland smiled and shook his head, and raised the bell at the table and shook it a few times. When he finished these trivial things one day earlier, he would be able to start the universal education work in Bianbu Town one day earlier. And the exploration of Anna's new ability also made him full of expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a tall knight who was brought into the living room by the escort. At first glance, it was handsome and extraordinary, compared to Carter who had a male face. Give more. Of course, this handsomeness is a deduction in the eyes of Roland. He swept his eye on the list, "Filling Sirte?" Unlike other people, there was a note behind the other name, and he also read it out. "The head of the Lions Knights, dawn dawn, the first knight in the West." ...you have a lot of titles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness." The film fell on one knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that people like the head of the team, the first knight will take the lead on the battlefield," Roland raised his eyebrows. "How do you live?" Down?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hid behind," he said calmly. "As long as you control the pace of the horse, it looks like you are sprinting, actually the horse. The speed does not increase a lot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This straightforward answer made Roland somewhat surprised. He thought that the other party would find some excuse to cover up his fear of fighting and escape. fact. It seems that this is not as simple as he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Feilin quickly said: "The third morning of your pursuit, that is, the day the Duke was defeated, I have been with him, looking for The opportunity came to him. Unfortunately, his number of guards was numerous and it was very tight. I couldn't find a suitable mobile phone. Fortunately, your troops killed him," said the Cavaliers, who had their heads deep down. Dear His Royal Highness, I am grateful for this. Any place that needs me, please feel free to send it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last sentence can be regarded as the affidavit of allegiance Roland took a moment to say: "You stand up first. Tell me what is happening?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," he said, "My wife, Irene, was originally a civilian woman working in the Long Song Fortress Theatre. We met in an encounter and then fell in love. I want to marry her, but my father and mother don't support this. Wedding, I had to move out of the territory, rent a house on the farm near the fortress, get married It was also held there. Shortly after the marriage, Irene finally got the chance to perform for the first time.” The knight’s voice was a bit low. “I didn’t expect the Duke to watch the play and see her. It didn’t take long for him to marry me. When I went out to perform the task, I broke into the house and raped Irene."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a long time, I only knew this from her mouth, I want to ask the Duke to ask I understand, but Irene kneels down and asks me not to be reckless. I also know that if you do it in person, there is not much chance of success. Even if I kill him, I can’t escape from the guard, and Irene... ...is likely to be treated as a revenge by the heirs of the Duke of Ryan. So I endured it until he went to Bianbu Town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although he did not revenge himself, But Irene can finally have a good night's sleep, no longer have to worry about someone breaking into her room at night, I am freed from this heavy burden. So please allow me to thank you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case. Roland knocked the table with a quill, which he and Nightingale agreed in advance signals need to review whether the other side when lying, he knocked the table. Soon, his left shoulder blade felt the nightingale's fingertips, which means the other person said it was true... but this one was slightly harder, and Roland picked up his lips. "Do you read literacy? Read and write?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." The film stunned and didn't seem to keep up with the prince's thoughts. "I will." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I am making a verdict now," Roland reaffirmed the words repeated many times. "...What is your choice?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you don't need me to fight for you? Whether it's a single-player duel or a group fight, I --"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
