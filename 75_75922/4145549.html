			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stayed around four in the morning, and Garcia slowly slept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words spoken by the other party in the middle of the night almost exceeded the sum after knowing her... Although it was not so much a conversation, it was better to say that Garcia was alone. Self-speaking is more appropriate. Most of the content is the process of meeting with the master 她 after she left the three-leaf family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Roland can do is to keep her a glass of milk from time to time and then act as a quiet listener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also noticed that much of the justice and dedication that Garcia held up came from his teachings, including making every effort to protect the world. Don't give up at any time. Although the teachings of the other side are very strict, Jiaxia still regards the master as his pillar and goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandon those mental journeys, at least from the current point of view, there is a certain feeling for the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if the methods she said can work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0825 There are only two bedrooms, one of which belongs to Jieluo. Roland weighed the key from Garcia and the possible risks, and finally decided to take her. Put it on the main bed and sleep in the living room. This will allow the other party to rest well and avoid unnecessary misunderstandings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to GALgame's experience, this should be the safest choice...probably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he didn’t really want to spend the night on the couch, after all, he had been sleeping for a long time on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After setting up Garcia, Roland looked through the bedroom window to the city under the curtain of night - this is the city of dreams at four in the morning, the lights are still Shining in the city center, it is more eye-catching than any star. Although it looks very peaceful, it is as dangerous as another world. The "red moon" that represents erosion has already revealed its grace. The only difference is that one is hanging above the sky and the other is buried deep underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pulled the curtains and quit the world of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a familiar dizziness, he slowly opened his eyes, but the first thing that caught his eye was not the ceiling, but a pair of eyes like a star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." After the two pairs of eyes were in sight, Roland heard a short scream, and then the figure on the top of the head quickly disappeared without a trace, as if This is just an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough and cough - that, I just want to see if you wake up, after all, you have been sleeping for so long, a little worried - "The nightingale showed his figure at the desk." Again, why are you so awake so suddenly that it scares me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃... Roland was speechless at the moment, what did it mean to wake up too suddenly, could he still give a hint before waking up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, you are fine, I am going to go back to bed." She deliberately yawned. "Yes, Anna, she came at ten o'clock." I have looked for you, but if you haven't woken up yet, go back first. She also let me tell you, don't be too tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes, what time is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not long before twelve o’clock.” The nightingale went to the office door, "So... good night."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door was closed, Roland felt a strong tiredness hitting the heart, entering the dream world, although it seems to be sleeping, but the speed of energy consumption will not Therefore, it slows down, and the time flow rates of the two worlds are different. In other words, he has not rested for almost two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out and climbed up from the lounge chair. When he was about to make up for it, the corner of his eye suddenly caught a strange look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked toward the top of the floor-to-ceiling window and almost didn't be scared to scream! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw two pale faces hanging from the top of the window, clinging to the glass, even some deformation due to being too close. The eyes of the four black holes are staring at the house, don't mention how many people! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
