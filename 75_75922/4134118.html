			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Integrating existing intelligence, the conclusion of the staff is roughly the same -" Itis knocked on the table. "This arson is very likely One time, the sound of the East hits the West."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sounds to the West?" The Iron Axe sinks. "Do you mean that the enemy's goal is not to cut off the supply line of our army?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The devil thinks, but they can't do it." Isis pointed to the map, "from the ruins of Takira to the north of the forest terminal, this distance is better than the plains. The railway is still longer, more than 500 kilometers. How many red fog do they have to carry in order to hike to the arson zone and ambush? I think this, Tajira’s colleagues should be very clear.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't build a "blood line" and there is no outpost, the army can't support such a long line. "Takeira represents Felice," according to past experience, five hundred people are almost the limit of the devil. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the forest terminal is a permanent residence with a full range of fortifications, and it is not too much to say that it is a small fortress. "Itis went on to say, "My Majesty had made relevant plans long ago. Once the enemy set fire to the forest, Miss Yeh would create a sufficiently safe barrier to separate the fire from the site. This isolation belt is also a natural shooting range. There is no cover and no cover. The devil wants to cross the fire nets made up of several bunkers. There is no difference between the five hundred people and the death. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Take a step back and say that if they really have the means to send the army into the fascinating forest with the supply cut off, then the arson will expose itself. "Xiao Xiaochenguang added, "When the attack is launched directly in the middle of the night, the effect may be better. After all, the forest itself is a cover. It is easy to hide their actions before they enter the field controlled by the adults. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It makes sense..." The iron axe nodded. "But the front line, whether it was Sylvie or lightning and wheat, did not find the devil's trace." - If they plan to attack the Tower One site again, it is only now that they are late. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also a puzzle we haven't solved yet, maybe the enemy thinks of a new way of deceiving the investigation, or investing in something we have never seen before." New weapons. "Itis frankly replied, "but the sound of the East is not a must-have. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean... Tower Zero Site? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The focus of our investigation today is all in front of the railway, so this possibility is not ruled out." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the farther away from the front line, the power the devil can invest is limited. "The iron axe is thoughtful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is this truth. "Itis is sure.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand," the commander gave a command after a moment of silence, "When the Queen’s Highness returns, let the Heihe No. 1 Go to the No. 0 site, and on the 2nd, cruise between zero and one site. The remaining units remained motionless and increased their level of alert until the alarm was cancelled. In addition, even if the devil is unlikely to launch an attack from the north side of the forest, the fire will be extinguished as soon as possible. He turned his head and looked at Ai Gesha. "Can you please do this for you?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Rest assured, we will do our best. "The ice witch responded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Very good. The front line of the investigation remains unchanged, and the main line of defense is still the front line of Takira. Miss Sylvie - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Give it to me. "Silver nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe clap his hands. "At the current speed of the fire, it will probably burn to the edge of the forest terminal in the evening." If the devil does not know that Miss Ye can isolate the sea of ​​fire by herself, then when the sun is completely set, it should be the moment when they reveal their teeth. Now we have an hour or so, let's take action! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing at the top of the camphouse, Hilli felt over the cheeks The breeze has brought a touch of coolness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun is sinking into the earth a little bit, and the glory of the red glow reflects the sky. The vast grassland seems to have been dyed three times. The layers are completely different in color, the farthest is the golden color, the same as the sun; the near red is green, and the sky is set against the sky, it looks like a purple flower sea. The grass under the foot is covered by the shadow. , biased towards blue and black, is also the color of the night.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is also the countdown to the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time the sun goes down, it means that the enemy is one step closer to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, the reappearing natural scene also fades a bit of beauty, and becomes chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver turned over and looked southwest - although the hidden forest was not within the eye of the Eye of Magic, she would still take time to look at her eyes. The reason is not up, but I feel a little worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall that, no matter the judgment given by the staff, or the order issued by the iron axe, there is nothing to be picky, not to mention that it is dripping, at least calm careful. The devil lacking red mist supply is like a crucified line. The longer it is pulled, the weaker it is. If it is really at the forest terminal and the tower zero site, the defensive army is enough to support the reinforcements. There is no doubt that the enemy can invest the most power to attack, and it is still the front line of the railway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but why... This worry is lingering? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilvi shook his head and pressed the thoughts in his heart. He was about to glance at the front line again, and a spot of light suddenly appeared at the corner of his eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How come -? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was surprised to open her eyes and look toward the light of the group - it was red, like a dazzling flame, leaping into the field of vision, Moving fast to the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange, is it your own eyes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eye of magic should not be seen as far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I really can’t see it - the large black in the field of vision proves this. After the out of range, the magic eye will lose the ability to observe without dead ends. Thereby retreating into a common perspective. In the low-light and dull environment, it is difficult to distinguish the boundary between the earth and the forest, which is basically dark. This is also the case, the spot will be particularly eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it’s not an illusion, what is she seeing?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver suddenly Feeling a chill rising from the soles of the feet and going up the back, made it difficult for her to tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows what she is worried about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is also a point that everyone ignores. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is seeing magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it’s a huge magic—<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of the eye’s observation is limited because of With its own limitations, it is impossible to spread the magic to a farther place. However, when there is a strong source of magic power, such fluctuations will be counteracted on the magic eye, and thus "being" by themselves, just like forcibly penetrating the closed eyelids, reflecting the sunlight on the pupil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be directly sensed at this distance, the magic of the comer...what is amazing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curse of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilvey has only one name left in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human form of the ruins of Takira, the commander of the devil army. As the general, it has always been the core of the army. When the two armies confront each other, they will be like a chess player. They will win or lose with the chess game. There are few situations in which they are shirtless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they neglected that the other party is also a powerful high-level devil, and it has terrible combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the speed of red dot movement is still increasing, almost three times that of the flight of the scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party from the beginning is coming for the leaves! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
