			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem may be in the ability of the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe realized that the eldest son of Losey’s family only heard about the sale of witches, but ignored the factor of ability – the ability to be dangerous and strange would obviously be lowered. The price of the witch, after all, no one wants to lose his life under a negligence. To know that they are all extraordinary people, whether it is the devil's minions, it is always risky to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the witch’s ability sounds terrible, self-healing can not only hurt others, but also meet the needs of some hunters, so the price will be substantial beyond expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, don't you bid?" On the 76th, the first time I took the initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...wait again," Joel rubbed the sweat on his hand, although Otto said that the black letter is money, but how much is it worth? One thousand gold dragons, or two thousand? If the quota is exceeded, will the "black money" recognize it? What if I let myself pay for the gap? A series of problems poured into his mind, making him have some breathing difficulties, not to mention a thousand golden dragons, that is, he could not get a hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the bidding has gradually stabilized, each time the amount of increase is around ten gold dragons, and the interval is getting slower and slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1,260!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Is there any higher? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately knowing that he will not speak again, he will miss the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he bite his teeth, if the limit is exceeded, the identity of the ash ambassador will be revealed, they will not move to the ambassador of a country, and then drag Let Otto pay tomorrow morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bid, 1,500 Golden Dragons." He whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," immediately raised his right hand on the 76th, "1,500!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; The audience suddenly sounded a discussion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After raising the price of nearly three hundred, it is obviously a must for the witch. This method of bidding, in addition to indicating the attitude of the seller, also gives other bidders The meaning of the steps - after all, the "black money" invitation letter is a group of people whose wealth or power is at its peak. Maintaining a relationship is more important than a purely playful product. If it is not an irreplaceable thing, generally Will not continue to kill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the auction method that Joel learned from Denise, and he hopes that other bidders will be able to retreat in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his hopes quickly fell short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1,800!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected time, the crowd is ringing again A new quotation sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of Joel’s heart slammed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is a bidding auction - this means that the other party is like him, and he is determined to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult?" reminded on the 76th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two thousand." Joel clenched his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two thousand three hundred!" The guide has just bidbed for a while, and then continues to raise the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, even if it comes to self-healing ability, this price is too outrageous! In the slave market, a top female slave with good looks and skills will not exceed 100 gold dragons. If you buy a dozen casual games, you don’t have to worry about breaking the morning law. Isn’t it better than a witch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he noticed that the guide who shouted for the other person was a man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The guide is based on the gender of the bidder, right?" Joel hated, "So the guy is a woman? She doesn't have me." Such a hand, buy a witch to watch it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every two hundred, until she gives up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After now, Joel is also going out, he does not believe that the other side's foundation can compare with the morning and the third Family, anyway, this is what Otto asks, and there is trouble to let him fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the two competed for the price, the people around them began to whisper, apparently interested in this kind of good play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount has been soaring to four thousand, and the other side has finally been misfiring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this price has exceeded five times that Otto expects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four thousand times!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Twice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moderator’s unhurried tone makes him almost indifferent, and he can’t wait to rush to replace the small hammer that determines the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the nightmare-like price has never sounded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three times, deal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy is taking a breath and lying on the bench On the back, there is a feeling of wetness behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four Thousand Golden Dragons... The wealth that he has never touched in his life, now it’s for a witch, this is how the big nobility spends money. ? He suddenly felt that his days in the king's remnants were white, and the so-called pleasing winds are just a joke in the eyes of the big family and the merchants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, congratulations!" The guide said with a smile, "No. 10 is yours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around him also pay tribute to him - in any case, can throw 4,000 gold dragons for a short-term consumer, this handwriting is worthy of respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, wealth is a symbol of identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignore the anxiety and worry during the auction, the experience at this moment is as sweet as honey, and he is the first to taste the focus, not I am accustomed to contempt or perfunctory, but the attention and attention of the big guys. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the next auction item a slave?" asked about the aftertaste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The finale is not," answered on the 76th. "I heard that it is a very rare baby. "Black money" took a lot of energy to get of. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even you don't know? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The boss said that this is more mysterious," she said helplessly. "He only revealed to us that it is a relic, and there is also a magic stone embedded in it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So can that thing shine? "About your mouth," you said before that there is no magic stone auction in the list. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are more than one kind of magic stone. Some stones can't shine, but they are the top jewels," explains the 76th. "For example, six months ago." The blue star that was auctioned out at 3,400 Golden Dragons is a magic stone that does not shine. But in the dark, you can see that there are countless stars in the interior, which is not comparable to the average gem. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price is not the average gems can have, about the heart can not help but some curiosity, in the end what it looks like to be able to sell such a high price? Anyway Otto The things that have been done have been completed, and then I will have a long experience, and I will be able to boast a few more words in front of Denise.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will wait until the end After a round of bidding, the result was disappointing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was actually a long sword.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are indeed four brightly colored gems on the hilt, but is this a stone or a weapon?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The host blew his mouth and said that it was found Located in an ancient relic of the desperate mountains, the murals around it indicate that the sword once belonged to an outstanding warrior. In her hands, this sword can even illuminate the sky, and her enemy is the devil from hell. Swearing at it, maybe it’s more practical to take down the gems and sell them separately, and the other party puts the propaganda words Focus on weapons is a clear mistake <br <br /> & nbsp />;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
