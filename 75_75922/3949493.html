			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days before I started to explore the ruins, Tilly’s greatest interest was to slowly stroll along the flat streets of Bianbu Town, observing the amazing occurrence in the hands of Lord Roland Changing remote territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a different town, she thought, the more carefully observed, the stronger the feeling. It is very different from anywhere she has been to... The one that impressed her the most is probably the unparalleled vitality that this town has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the emerging sleeping islands cannot be compared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is these people not afraid of freezing?" Looking at the pedestrians coming and going on the street, Andrea was curious, "Your brother promised." What are the benefits that make them willing to come out in the winter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is Zhongqiu," Ashes spread his hands, "You won't even be able to distinguish the seasons." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it is no different from winter. This is an analogy. It often appears in "Her Dreams, His Country,"" Andre Asians gracefully pick up long hair. "Of course, the barbarian will not understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your dream, my dream..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, it’s hard to communicate with vulgar people who haven’t appreciated drama. Tilly’s adults must have watched this famous drama from the dawn kingdom.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't want to fight," Hillway sighed. "I think the reason is probably very simple. Winter civilians are reluctant to move because they are expensive and not enough. It is easy to catch cold, but these problems do not exist in the town. The food price is not high here, the firewood is also very good, and Miss Lily can cure the cold, so they will work hard with the cold wind and snowflakes - one day more You can get more than one day's salary."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The firewood is sufficient, I can understand that the west is the forest, there are many forests around, the food price is not high. ......How is this possible?” Andreas wondered. “My family has also been involved in selling food, such as a poor harvest caused by natural disasters. Everyone will raise the price of food very high. Like this bad weather, Aristocrats and businessmen can't afford to sell high prices?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aristocrats? Merchants?" Sylvia said with a smile. "There is only one person allowed to buy and sell food, that is His Royal Highness Roland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The farmland by the river is all his industry?" Tilly frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, that’s the farmer’s own field,” she told herself about what she saw and heard here, as well as the scene at the harvest. He has set two food prices, one for the purchase price and one for the sale price, both of which are fixed, the latter being higher than the former.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Isn't this a strong buy and sell?" Ashes said with an unpredictable expression, "He can sell high prices, why not allow others to sell high prices?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Not the same," Tilly said. "When the wheat is collected, it needs to be threshed, ground, and stored. These are costs, and the price increase is very normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tilly said that it was correct, I later asked the teacher of the book to understand," Hilli said with a smile. "She said that after the extra cost of this part is collected, it can be paid as a salary. Those who deal with wheat can build new granaries and expand production scale, which can provide new towns for the town..." She thought "Working position, yes, she said that at the time. I heard that His Royal Highness Roland is very concerned about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he is still strong and strong, "Ashes emphasizes, "should trade be free?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it is, but the price of the sale is not high enough for everyone to buy it." The extent of the rise. If the price can remain fixed, the public will be more secure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes not everything is free, the best," Tilly Sorry, she has roughly understood the intention of Roland's practice. It is forbidden to sell food to other people in the territory. It seems to be overbearing and unfair, but in fact it has eliminated hoarding and can effectively avoid the skyrocketing of food in the event of shortage. If it is in the kingdom, such a rare autumn snow falls, the price of food will inevitably rise to five or six times the weekdays. More than half of the civilians will be hungry because of insufficient food. It will be easy to cause riots after a long time, and finally they will be released by the palace. Relief food or dispatched guards to suppress. In either case, it is a big burden on the national treasury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
