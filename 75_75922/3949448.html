			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo Stoll walks through the town and heads for Chishui River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current border town is already a bustling place, it is hard to imagine the outpost that was set up just to detect the movement of evil beasts. At the foot is a dark gray and hard ground. On both sides of the street are neatly arranged bungalows. Unlike residential buildings, these houses are not used for living. The space is much more spacious than the house. It is somewhat like the warehouse of the small one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the meaning of the Highness, these houses are for sale later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the bungalow is a deep drain with slate on it, as if it were a black border with two borders. In addition, every other distance, a large tree will be planted along the roadside, sandwiched between two bungalows, and the branches will be close to the center of the road, which will not only cover the rain and rain, but also give people a pleasing feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that the biggest feeling for him here is regularity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is a house, a road, or a ditch or a tree, it is located in a well-planned location, and its level of detail is no less than that of a noble garden garden. The feeling of strolling in Bianbu Town is comparable to that of Chishui City – although the latter’s scale is denser and larger, the extremely coordinated layout makes these bland houses a unique Aesthetic. This feeling overshadows the size of the individual, and on the whole shows a higher level of grandeur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like those uniform chemical formulas, he thought, this is the beauty brought by order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo is now well-known in the town, and the pedestrians will nod and bow to him and respectfully call him a sage. However, he prefers the title of chemist than the sage, but it is a pity that His Royal Highness Roland said that he must understand "Medium Chemistry" before he can win this honor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the central area, you can see the Chishui River across the west. The number of laboratories on the river has increased to four, but the latter two are not enough. The manpower can only be idle for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo is preparing to call several apprentices to complete the mission of His Highness, and a soldier in the first uniform has come over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord Stil, a sailboat in the dock area with more than fifty...civilians," he said after the salute, "due to the number of people Too many, and not like a businessman, the garrison stopped them. One of them said that he wanted to see you. He claimed to be an alchemist from Chishui City, named "-<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chames!" Kemer excitedly grabbed the soldier's shoulder. "Come and take me to see him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the soldier to the dock area, a familiar figure reflected in his eyes - the person is really Chames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher Master!" The other party also discovered Kemo for the first time and immediately waved his hands toward him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These are the alchemists and alchemists I invited," he said before he went to the garrison captain. "Put everyone in, I will take them to the municipality." The hall is registered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sir. But please allow me to send a team to escort them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is escort, actually monitoring and control, so as to avoid someone leaving the team and mixing into the town center. However, this is the rule set by His Royal Highness, and Kaimo has no intention of interfering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher adults, what are they going on? Why is there a person in a deserted town who specializes in the dock?" Chamis, who was released, walked quickly to him. Someone complained uncomfortably, "and the investigation is stricter than the city guards of the big cities. Even the name of the name has to be asked. I have not let the silver wolf change their minds."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Wolf?" Kemer asked with interest, "How many?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is one, Chamez gave a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
