			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is coming fast and ending very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it pierces the evolved tail hook into the center of another eye of the nest, the outcome is a foregone conclusion. The rapidly spreading neurotoxins will destroy the will of the other party, and the "blade" and "foot" that are out of control will also flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the body of the nesting eye, it satisfactorily withdrew the tail hook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been like the poor worms, repeating the purposeless collection, and waiting for the mother of the main nest to determine their fate. The latter has not changed much yet, but it has become a hunter for the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the original appearance, its changes can be described as earth-shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using some pheromone of deep-sea fish, it separates the eyes from the organs, attaches to the epidermis, and evolves magical power around the ribs. Carapace. This makes the body's defense ability greatly improved, even if it encounters the odious two-legged bug again, it will not be easily invaded by the other side. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, long-range combat is clearly safer than melee combat, and it can now synthesize violent explosives in the body to launch gallstones and bone spears. Although there is a structure that draws on another class of lower insects, it is much more effective overall, at least not relying on magic power when attacking, and will not be disturbed by the god stone. In order to accommodate these organs, its entire size has been expanded by more than three times, and the general "blade" has no way to take it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is a poisonous tail hook that can give a fatal blow to a large target and preserve the complete body in order to capture the pheromone. A weapon that comes in one fell swoop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that it can't be counted as the same kind of creature with those eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to distinguish the former self, it even taught the worms to give themselves a name - "phag". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devouring everything, evolving itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the nest that are scattered throughout the sea to collect pheromones are undoubtedly the most valuable prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Break" open the shell, countless tentacles come out, pull the other side into the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, it suddenly felt a very strange fluctuation -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The magnitude is so great, it is like the heavens and the earth roaring together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks into the sky, except for the dense clouds and the high red moon, the dome seems to have no change, but in its eyes, the gray sky is It’s like picking up a cockroach and spreading it out into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong uneasiness surrounds it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is the intense eruption of the seabed rock or the spontaneous tremor of the earth, there will be a variety of fluctuations, but there has never been a feeling that is now felt. same. It is too pure and full of rhythm, so it looks horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;涟漪 quickly dissipated in the sky, but has not waited for "phag" to return from the suspicion, a familiar taste poured into it through the tentacles The body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the evolutionary instruction issued by the mother of the main nest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of instructions were received by the center of the Eyes of the Nesting, and a new bridge was built for devouring. After losing contact with the main nest for so long, it did not expect to hear the call of the community again in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, its body first identified the contents of these pheromones and subconsciously wanted to follow them! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is - a unique individual! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell out the body of the eye of the nest, "Pop" to roll around to counter the reaction in the instinct, guarding the "blade" and "foot" on the side It didn't move, and several of the tail hooks that were swept directly by it made a patties, and the surrounding sea water stirred up the waves. Almost every effort is made to "control" the impulse of the heart and force the incentives of change to be suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After easing the gas, it hesitated again and again, and finally let the "foot" fish back the sinking eyes. After all, if you can understand the evolution direction of the ethnic group, it will be more convenient to hunt other nest eyes later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It carefully re-pierces the tentacles into the other side of the center, feels the will of the main nest, and memorizes the instructions containing pheromones one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end result is shocking it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This instruction is also too... too much! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that evolution has always been a very cautious thing, and that any refactoring is impossible to be perfect on a single item, just as flexibility is always relative to sturdiness. A high outbreak means low continuity, and if you want to achieve perfection, you can't do without the overall trade-off. It is precisely because of this that the main nest every time the evolutionary instructions are released after repeated analysis and screening, the basic decision will not exceed two, and the priority of the nest is much higher than the secondary dependency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time it has read many evolutions that affect both the eye and the vassal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, "bearing pain", "speed clotting", "rapid breeding", "sharp carapace", etc... even some pheromones are still from Screening the original fragments, this is exactly the opposite of the previous practice of the mother of the main nest! Not only that, some instructions even cover the original beasts that provide mutation pheromones, completely reckless! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, these evolutions can greatly enhance the strength of the community in a short period of time, but it is also the future of the ruined group. It still vaguely remembers the tendency that is engraved in the bloodstream - the ultimate goal of their evolution is not to continue, but to fly to higher heavens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the evolution is complete, the defects caused by inferior pheromones will be difficult to compensate, and the cost is too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not understand that the mother of the main nest made the basis for this decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, its fate has been completely separated from the ethnic group, no matter what this change means, it has nothing to do with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After breaking down the nest, "Phase" dive toward the deep sea and soon disappeared into the waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too late...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watchman stood on the calm sea and looked at the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shallow waves rushed to the shore of the island, giving a monotonous and gentle rustling sound. But she knows that this is probably the last silence of this sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distant horizon is dyed with a thick dark red, from time to time you can see the arc of magic formed by it, like a huge storm cloud is slowing down Slowly formed. It will not take long for this bloody red cloud to reach the sky above the dawn and become part of the battle for fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in another, farther direction, the sea has set off a black "wave" that stretches for hundreds of kilometers, like a moving island reef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of God, they will eventually come together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene has been seen countless times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this time, I am afraid it is the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, that does not mean the end, for the whole world, nothing more than a resumption of everything. But the beginning is just another round of repetition for thousands of years, and the people watching here will not be her again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
