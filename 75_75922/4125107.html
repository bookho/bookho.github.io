			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop the show? But the shadow has been filmed, and the actors don’t need to be on stage... No, the key is why he said this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei, who did not expect the other party to make such a request, was in a sudden stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably knowing what I said is a bit horrified, Kajin quickly added, "It’s not a cancellation, it’s just a temporary suspension, for example, it feels uncomfortable. Need a break - after a week or so, I think those officials should agree to let us meet you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." Meyben I want to say that the shadow is different from the drama in the past. The performance was not carried out by the Star Flower Troupe. But the phrase "but" just led to the laughter of Roentgen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that she has been patient for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said that you are in vain. This is what she has helped, and how can I temporarily stop? Teacher, you see the wrong person. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that you just went astray and gave up the pursuit of drama. I didn't expect it to be so." Benes is not willing to swear. Lame, "I have said good things for you that day... Mrs. Lannis, what do you think of drama as a tool for fame?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If she doesn't say it, we are still in the dark, the wife of the chief Cavalier Carter Lannis, those officials who want to please her is not a normal move? I don't believe in the reputation of Mr. Ka Jin, Roland will even one The chances of the show are not given!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough!" Kajin Fiss snorted. "I didn't want to hear you quarreling." And I don't think Mayi will do that. If you don't believe my judgment, please leave this room. I just want to hear it now. The answer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, Mayi was almost in amazement, and from the sarcasm of these people, she pieced up an incredible story— - The Kajin Theatre Company wanted to perform a drama to His Majesty before the ceremony, and submitted an application to the City Hall in accordance with the charter, but the reply was unexpectedly rejected. Therefore, after learning that she married the Chief Knight, Lunqin and others It is believed that she has been stalking from it, and the officials under the pressure have pressed down the application and directly gave the troupe a closed door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a big misunderstanding! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If things do, as she thinks, the other party’s undisguised hostility can be explained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s a rejection or a disappointment, or even a controversy in order to win a role, it’s just a contradiction between actors. This is very common in the world of drama, and no one will be enemies of such things. But the use of other forces to hinder the performance of the other party is completely different, and it is considered a violation - a violation of the career of the drama performers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change to her, I am afraid that I will be more indignant and contempt than them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the members of the troupe who accompanied me that day, I did not mention anything that happened in the hotel with anyone." Mey said slowly, "This I can guarantee it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe this too, so I decided to talk to you," Kajin licked his forehead. "We are here." The newly established city knows nothing about it and doesn't know where the problem is. This is also because of helplessness. Of course, we will compensate afterwards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Referring to the word compensation, Roentgen and others frowned and looked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mey didn’t bother to think about what the compensation was at the moment. With her understanding of Kajin Fez, the other party must have him. Reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before answering you, I want to ask a question first," she thought for a moment. "Before your management mentioned, you are very disappointed with me... Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man was silent for a long while, then waved to the famous actors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher..." Roentgen seemed to want to say something, but eventually closed his mouth and turned away from the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
