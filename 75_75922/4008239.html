			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister, we are here," Cole Condén rushed into the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have told you twice, this trip does not call my sister," Itis looked up and swept him. "You forgot?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..." Cole trembled. "No, I remember."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who am I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, my clerk, Ms. Isis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"What about you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father...no, the ambassador of the Northern Duke Calvin Kant."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, remember not to make the third mistake," Itis stood up, and moved some stiff hands and feet out of the cabin. "Call the messenger group, we go to the inner city." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small trick that Isis usually plays. She always likes to observe her own negotiating objects behind the scenes, and after making a preliminary impression, she will come forward to negotiate. In addition to being able to plan ahead, you can also give each other a fresh feeling. If the goal is male, there will be an interest in yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She never evades her female identity, but instead sees it as a communicative advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the title of the North Pearl, naturally can not be wasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about the head?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course it is first placed on board, it is difficult You still want to enter the bedroom with that stuff?" She grinned. "They have stinked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking down the trestle, Isis noticed the canal The ships in the area are extraordinarily numerous, and there are many crowds on the dock. Most of them carry bags, and they don’t look like slaves or businessmen. This made her quite curious. In addition to the above two categories, very few people will travel in the spring season. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She recruited a follower, "to ask where they are going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What does it have to do with us?" Cole did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland.When he occupied the city, Roland Wimbledon always issued some new policies to declare his authority, which can also reflect his temperament from the side. Of course, it has something to do with us." Itis smiled. "You can also spend a few golden dragons and ask the mice to help you collect them, but I prefer the news I heard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, is this the case..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To see more, think more, Ambassador, adult, She said, "This is a rare opportunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the gate, the pedestrians on the street suddenly increased, and the simple stalls were placed on both sides of the road. Merchants sipped their own goods, and shouted for a while. A few years ago, Itis had participated in the adult ceremony of the Five Princesses with her father. The image of the city and the memory did not change much, and it was still very lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are in the city of Yong Ye, not a festival or a celebration, you will never see the scene of the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a street speaker attracted her attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a moment," Isis let the team stop moving forward, and took Cole to the crowd where the people gathered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to cut wood? Will you build gray bricks? Will you take care of the cattle and sheep? As long as there is a skill, it is the talent that Roland needs! Go to the West. Your Majesty is building a new kingdom there - no winter city! Your talents will bring you great rewards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talent? It is an interesting statement that Itis is pondering. But what does the new king mean? No winter city? Is there such a city in the West? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The witch is not guilty. This is the confession written by the high priest before the execution." Another preacher waved the instrument in his hand. "They may be your loved ones, your daughter, your sister! If you still If you are afraid of them, send them to No Winter City! There, they will receive meticulous care. If you are not willing to leave them, you can also go together! Your promise is that the witch’s family will get a shelter from the wind. House and decent work!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The high priest was executed?" Kerr squinted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis has frowned. If this is Roland Wimbledon’s New Deal, it’s too much to be promoted. He is not afraid of recruiting thunderous revenge from the church. It is not a battle between nobles, but a war of heresy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know whether it’s a blessing or a curse to be loyal to such a king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After spending half an hour walking through the streets of the inner city, she discovered that there were such presenters everywhere, almost to the king Everything that has been done afterwards has been repeatedly written. Anyone who comes to the kingdom, as long as he listens to the street for a long time, can understand these changes, even the mouse does not have to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, I have asked," the waiter who was ordered to inquire about the news, panting and catching up with the team. "They are all ready to go - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Winter City, right?" Itis interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hotel didn't look for it, let's go The palace submitted the messenger's documents," she said, and there was a bad feeling in her heart. "Now, hurry!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" Kerr said differently, "Has Roland's Majesty already left the king for a week? Didn't the ceremony be held?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The receptionist said so," said the attendant, "The original minister left a chief minister named Barov Mons, but he also left the kingdom yesterday. Now the palace In addition to the maid, it has no one to live in. The receptionist also said that if you want to talk to the city hall, he can tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" ", Itis cold voice. She did not expect the hunch to be fulfilled, and she rushed all the way, but the result was empty - Roland actually planned to move the king, let this big city do not, go to the West to rebuild a new city! What did he think in his head? To know the cities of this size, it is impossible to complete the construction of three or four decades! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do we do?" Cole whispered as he looked at the messenger members behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was sullen, and it took a while to open her mouth. "Turn back to the dock, we will go to no winter city!"<br /><br />&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Anyway, people are gone, we don't have to hurry," Cole said bitterly. "I didn't take a bath in a week. I feel that my body is getting too long.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis snorted and sniffed the collar, and smelled a strange smell. She finally sighed. "Then find a hotel to rest for one night and start tomorrow morning." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the second angels arrived at the dock, they found that their ships were burned with only the skeleton left.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is going on here? "Itis felt that my head was not enough for the first time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, don't be angry, sister - Ms. Itis, look more, more I want to..." Cole waved a passerby. "Will there be a fire at the pier?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, you said this," the other party explained enthusiastically. "I don't know which damn corpse on the ship, the taste is stolen." The mouse smelled. You don't know, everyone is particularly sensitive to this thing. After all, half a year ago, there was a plague in the city, which was caused by the body scattered by the church. In short, to deal with this thing, only a fire is safe. The captain has been arrested and questioned by the guards. Why, do you know him? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
