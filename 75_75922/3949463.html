			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly a week of assembly and testing, Roland and Anna completed the development of the bomb touch fuze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to the fuze of the projectile, it does not need to withstand high temperature and high pressure, nor does it have a high G overload when it exits, so the structure is extremely simple. But it was such a thing made up of a striker and a spring, and the two also tested many times before they succeeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem is that no one knows how much spring force the spring needs to be able to catch fire when accidentally falls, and it is guaranteed that the striker can stably trigger the bottom fire when throwing normally. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and Anna can only test a little by changing the thickness and hardness of the spring. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the latter and Lucia did a lot of preliminary work on weekdays, so Roland is getting more and more quality materials at hand. The last test was the No. 1365 alloy steel, which has a high hardness and low toughness. Even if the bomb falls from a height of one meter, it will not be compressed to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right spring was chosen and the rest was watered. Even if Roland has not seen the true fuze, he can design it by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is definitely backward behind, but it is enough for a silly bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finished version of the touch fuze is like a cylinder, 12 cm long, about five centimeters in diameter, threaded below, can be screwed into the opening in the top of the bomb . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its interior is a downward convex groove, and the striker is similar in appearance and can be inserted into the groove just right. In the normal state, its upper part is placed at the notch by the spring, and the needle falls into the groove, just one finger away from the bottom fire. To be on the safe side, Roland also opened a hole in the head of the striker and fixed it to the shell with a plug. Before the bomb was thrown, the iron rod must be pulled out before the needle can move up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simulation test was conducted on a windy and sunny afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the bomb is close to the weight of five nightingales after filling the gravel and black powder, Roland did not board the hot air balloon, but at the bombing site of three hundred The rice is viewed with a lookout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to him, the first test of the pilot is the Iron Axe and the Chief Cavalier Carter Lannis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you going to throw a giant explosive pack into the palace with a hot air balloon?" After listening to Roland's battle plan, Carter couldn't believe his ears. Attacking from a height of two kilometers, ignoring the city wall and the garrison power, completely overturned his previous operational concept - of course, in the year of Bianbu Town, he has been subverted many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not impossible to achieve this as long as it is properly controlled," Roland nodded. "Tefco is forcing a new militia. If he can't stop him, the West Inevitably, it will be attacked by the Pelican Army. Even if it wins, it will not give us a slight benefit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa’s secret The letter indicates that Tefko still wants to use his usual old routine to consume his own strength, and he does not know whether the team of the ambassadors that Barov sent out can bring more people to Bianbu Town before the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can really throw the wrath of Thunder to the head of Tefco, he will be scared to be overwhelmed!" said the iron axe excitedly. "This is simply an irresistible punishment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope so," Roland smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Tassa mentioned in the letter, Tefco probably has already figured out the formula of black powder and opened a workshop in the inner city to try mass production. This dangerous item, but he considered to be the top of the palace after the selection of the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is simple, because the palace is striking enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down from the height of two kilometers, even the most magnificent city in Grey Fort is only half a slap in size, so you must find it in advance when you bomb. point. The palace is located in the center of the inner city, surrounded by red tile walls, the top of the palace is pure white stone slabs, it looks particularly eye-catching during the fall, it is almost impossible to admit the wrong target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
