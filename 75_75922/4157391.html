			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...dreaming? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish ball blinked, and the high-order devil not only did not kill him, but also contacted the witch commander? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the paper in front and the broken gun body told him that this is not an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned over and picked up the piece of paper - the latter did not wrap any cover, nor was it stamped with wax, the content above was directly revealed, even though he knew himself He shouldn't have to look at it, but he couldn't help but glance at his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottomless? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t understand what it means...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the fish pill sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just from the text, I’m afraid no one can think of it, this “letter” is actually from the hands of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, other people!" He suddenly realized that now is not the time to ponder the letter itself, he still has several teammates missing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fokker! Cardia! Blanket-!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish pill yells While stumbling toward the forest, I didn't feel it when I first saw the high-level devil. When the crisis was lifted, he suddenly found that his legs were so soft that he could only stand firm if he grabbed the trunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, there was a weak response from the teammates in the forest. "Captain - is the captain?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a search, the starting team recovered a total of four people, and the remaining two disappeared, just like disappearing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The note was quickly handed over to the superior officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only three days later, the fish balls received an order to go to the Glory City to see Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one responsible for transshipment is actually the Seagull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He faintly felt that this matter is far more than just a letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is the result?" After the inquiry, Roland asked the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s all true, your soldiers are not lying." The night shrug shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it..." To be honest, Roland also believes that this is unlikely to be a story made by frontline soldiers, but the situation is extremely special, and the focus is always right. . After all, the matter seems to him to be very strange and incredible. "Then I will enter the dream, I will take care of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't say I will," the nightingale turned and put on the curtains, in the study room. The light suddenly dimmed. "Are you going to see the devil again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a witch who always stays by his side, it’s hard to have a secret to stay overnight - she knows the only thing The person who really came from the secret letter. Even if you don't take the initiative to mention it, you will understand it as long as you listen to the conversation between him and the ancient witch. Of course, Roland also has no intention to conceal his ideas. The reason why he does not disclose it to more people is to avoid unnecessary worry, especially Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no doubt that the previous letter has expired, Hecksod is back." He whispered, "and another one appeared on the battlefield." A powerful high-level devil - you also saw that if the two men joined forces, it would cause much trouble for the first army. I must figure out their intentions before this, and at this point, whether it is Taqi Pulling the witch or Itis can't provide much help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it can be said that it is a "falling event", no winter city is under attack, the crisis is far Unresolved, now there is something that has to be prioritized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking of you may not believe, I can play especially in my dreams." Roland looked at the woman who seemed to be hidden in the darkness and slowly lay on the soft couch. "But don't worry, I will bring a few more people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, see you later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closes his eyes and makes himself sleepy--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, Roland is in the rose The cafe saw the Wakiris as scheduled, and told the story of the fish balls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It turns out that," the other side whispered for a long time while stirring the coffee. "They... looking for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s an illusion, Roland thinks that Wakiris’s movements are more and more like a human being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They? Do you know the identity of another person?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris looked up I glanced at him, "Cerroshhi - that is the silence that I mentioned before. But it rarely takes off the heavy armor, so it is not surprising that you regard it as other high-ranking promoters. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was dumb, the name of the silence, of course, he knows that as early as the god of God made it into the desolate mountains, Sylvie noticed This is a big king devil. He also confirmed the identity of the other side through the various information collected on the front line - the "Xialita", which is rare among the devils, the talented mad warrior, and the former caretaker who passed down the debris. . Even under the guidance of the debris, he had had close contact with the other party. That's right, the armor enemies who are sitting on the Blackrock Throne are silent monarchs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that he didn’t expect that the real thing hidden behind the armor would be this look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure they are looking for you?" Roland said with amazement. "But this letter is to be given to the witches..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the letter is very simple, almost the same as the nightmare handed out, just to replace the devil text with human words. This is also a place that makes him difficult to understand. Even if the "witch commander" knows about it, what does it mean to them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't understand it is normal, because you are not us." Wajiris put down the spoon and sipped his coffee. "In fact, just change the angle, I can guess what they mean. First of all, I am missing because I am looking for the cause of human ascension. If I am still alive, I must rely on someone’s consciousness field to survive. Otherwise, it is impossible to keep myself under the impact of the sea of ​​consciousness. Until now, let alone pass the message out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the most likely to contact the conscious world is the witch?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course there is you," Wakiris said calmly. "But considering that I can still hear the news, the chances of being a witch are higher." Heckzod speculated that I might have convinced a witch to reach a consensus and only have the first note. If I convinced you, then it would be a good idea to directly lead the humans to surrender. Zhou Zhang."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you really want to say... is it right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Don't care about this detail,” Wajilis did not refute. “In a sense, the relationship between persuasion and control is stronger, because the latter is a unilateral act, and the former is a common idea. Caused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suddenly remembered what Aegis had said, during the first battle of God, some humans became believers of the devil... ...he shook his head and moved his ideas back on track. "But even then, they have no way of knowing, which one do you rely on?" There is a sphere of consciousness in the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true. But it is not easy to send a piece of paper from the gray castle to the wolf heart, especially In times of war, what is capable of doing it will certainly not be a nameless generation. She should have a certain influence in the human kingdom, or the message is very well-informed. Then the letter to the witch commander becomes the most clever choice - This matter will inevitably lead to high-level attention, which will be known to the sender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
