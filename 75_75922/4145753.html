			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tili’s body was obviously trembled, and she turned her head a little bit, her eyes mixed with complex looks, as if she suspected she had misunderstood, “You said ...what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said that the ashes may still be alive." Roland repeated as slowly as possible - he knew that once it was said, There is no turning back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... Brother," she strongly held up a smile. "Even if you want to comfort me, you can't..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this kind of living is not quite the same as you think," Roland interrupted her. "To be honest, I didn't react much better than you when I heard this news. I also know that It’s unfair to you before being completely certain, but it’s better than regretting it later.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly closed her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just stared straight at Roland as if she was digesting the content of the passage - at this point, she realized that it was not Too unusual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of sensitivity and acceptability, Tilly has always been a top-level group of witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour or so, she asked tentatively, "Who did you listen to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"岚."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven’t heard of..." Tilly thought, "Is it... related to the dream world?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a man who once talked to Anna and laughed, Roland calmly replied, “Don’t worry, I will tell you the details of the matter one by one.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stops telling, the sky is slightly white, soft light is After the mountains, they showed their heads and painted a layer of gold for the buildings on the far side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly is unaware of this, she muttered ecstatically, "That is... as long as I can control the ideology, I can call back and still have A conscious ash?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In theory," Roland nodded. "According to the swearing, the witch becomes super-existent and will be in consciousness." The world has left traces, which can also be consistent with the information revealed by Kabradby."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the initial interrogation of the captured high-level devil, the other I once said to Zoe that their souls will be tolerated by the source of magic and will return to the world when the people reach the summit. Although the source of this rhetoric is unknown, and the interpretation of 岚 is quite different, at least one point is common. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the consciousness community has the ability to contain the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only that, the ancient books of underground civilization have also been mentioned, the road to chasing the gods is the process of climbing the magic ladder step by step, one day, the winner will If you think of the ideology as the top of the magic, then you can also blame it from the side." He said that it was paused here, "but considering that the sources of information obtained by these civilizations may come from The so-called gods, so can not fully believe that the best way is to take a look at yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brother..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Rest assured, I will get through the barriers of the conscious world as soon as possible and try to get back to the ashes - if she is really there. And before that, I hope you can protect Be yourself, lest she come back and ask me for trouble. After all, a stone that is not subject to the limits of God's punishment, and breaks through the super-existence of self-limits, I can't stand it..." Roland deliberately said something easy, thinking To ease the atmosphere, I found that Tilly’s reaction seemed to be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lowered her head, her shoulders twitching, and whispering something. Roland held his breath and listened to the other's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great! Great..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sang for a moment, don't know How to pick it up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the five kings who were trembled, he finally sighed and slowly reached out and pressed it on the other's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the next moment, Tilly leaned over and hugged him. The twitching also turned into a clear sob, and the scene at the moment seemed to be the same as before, but Roland could feel that something had changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Tilly didn’t cry for hours. After more than ten minutes, her mood gradually stabilized. When she looked up from Roland’s arms, she also His face was forcibly twisted to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...not allowed to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the cleaning sound of 窸窸索索It is probably rubbing the face and nose of the crying flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a while, Roland was allowed to get back to his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry...it makes you worried." Tilly whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it," Roland held his hands in his chest. "Last and my mention, you should rethink -"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean a plane that can deal with the devil?" Tilly blinked. "That can't be done, brother."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to reach the bottomless land as soon as possible, you need my help. Now the devil is probably already Standing up a fully-fledged obelisk, the action of the beast will be more difficult to suppress. If you can't capture the sky, the first army may not be so easy to destroy the enemy's territory." Tilly held out a finger and stopped Roland from wanting to say If you say, "I did have some desperate thoughts before. I feel that as long as I can kill more devils, it doesn't matter how I am, but now I will never think so."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you should also be clear about how big the gap between yourself and someone is pointing, not in the empty knight Knowing how to fight the devil, the only thing that can quickly grasp this and pass it on to them is me." She patted her chest. "I promise you, I will be waiting for you to enter the conscious world." That day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland found that he couldn’t say a word of rejection. At this moment, Tilly’s eyes were full of brilliance, and the previous calm did not fade much. It’s like shining up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay...but be sure to remember what you promised me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course "She paused for a moment, "And... thank you for telling me about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, I don't know if this method will work in the end."通—”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s enough, at least we have a goal now.” Tilly once again gently put her forehead on Roland’s chest. “You can be My brother, that’s great...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Tilly left The nightingale returned to the office. "What did you say to Your Royal Highness? When I saw her going out, it seemed like I changed someone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "On the connection between the dream world and the real world, if you want to know, I can say it to you, but not now." Roland cleaned the drawings in his hand. "I just received the honey message, a fleet." Should be in two After arriving at the river terminal, it should be the first immigrants who moved back from the wolf heart. Before that, I had to perfect the drawings of the new project."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night Shrugging, "How can I be good - I didn't tell you before, you don't want to say, I will never ask more." She went to the desk and looked at the drawings for a while, "This stuff... and Anna’s driving in the yard that day was a bit like it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “This is the same thing, it’s just a few times larger.” Roland laughed. Did Barov not mention logistical issues in the previous meeting? It is the solution.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the costly trains, land transport has a more Cheap tools, wheeled trucks - they have a lot of variants, but they are less flexible than trains, and the threshold is even lower than that of tractors. They can walk freely as long as they have a flat hard path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
