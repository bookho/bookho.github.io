			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland immediately picked up the phone that connected to the third side of the city, "Let Serin not dismantle the ritual Rubik's Cube! I will come right away!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...Yes, Your Majesty!" The opposite interrogator apparently had not figured out what had happened, but even so, he followed the instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me to the side of the city," Roland said, turning to the nightingale, "using the fastest speed."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understood," the latter smiled and jumped over to grab his hand. "That might be a little dizzy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the two instantly broke into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Roland pouted in the underground hall. I have to say that the nightingale has a lot of progress in the level of familiarity with the ability when it first met. In the black and white world, shuttle is like surfing. One wave after another makes people feel overwhelmed. However, she can take advantage of the trend, and her posture is flowing, saying that art is no problem. But these are not so good in his eyes - especially the changing contours blur the boundaries between the plane and the three-dimensional, the feeling of turning over and over and sometimes turning the left and right, more than a hundred times more than the roller coaster. "It’s finally... arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night laughs and pats his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, squat?" Celine slowly dropped from the top of the cave with a large tool. "I heard you looking for me?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the hammer, saw and sickle on the other's tentacles, Roland sighed. "It seems to be catching up."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but why are there long scorpions and axes in the tool? Is it difficult for her to break the cube into powder? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the ancient relic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Still in the underground laboratory."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath, "Can you copy it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin clearly "Are you sure? That stuff is not useful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it's not nothing." Roland simply told his thoughts, "Steam The biggest shortcoming of power is that the fuel itself is too heavy. If there is a way to replace it with Rubik's cube, it is likely to bring a new round of revolution to industrial production."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An efficient and powerful power source is always the core of the industry, whether it is used in manufacturing, power generation, or equipment, can cause qualitative changes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is not easy to take this step. The traditional boiler and Rubik's cube are not simply replaced. After the new heating method, the thermal cycle and interaction The system, control system, and maintenance will change, and there may be countless failures before success, but this may be worth the effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Boiled water... It turned out to be the case," said Celine for a moment, then some were awkward, "but...if it’s not internal If the structure is carefully explored, I am afraid it is difficult to imitate it - after all, it involves magic, and you are not allowed to disassemble it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough I mean, don't use it as garbage for dismantling." Roland coughed twice. "If it is for the purpose of copying, careful and careful splitting, then of course there is no problem."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there any inconspicuous and careless split?" said Celine, and then the tone seemed to be aggrieved. "It used to be a secret and damaged any relics. I have to accept the punishment. I have not been punished since I joined the club until the fall of Tacila. Nataya also praised myself and said that I have a pair of natural hands. If I do research, I am still losing my money. The core instruments in the main hall are estimated to be long gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this boastful argument, Roland will be suspiciously looking at the tools in her hands. "Have you used them to break down the relics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
