			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately, my heart suddenly lamented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, did you say that you are no longer seeing each other? If you have trouble finding an ambassador, it’s just a sentence, don’t take it seriously! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Otto and hesitated for a while and said: "Bring her in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not the gold medal of the exhibition here, he really wants to move directly out of the ambassador is not in the government, please do not close the next time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy-six quickly took her hand into the room, the tenth round of the "black money" auction, Amy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw Joel, the witch caught his arm anxiously. "Adult, please help us, Anne, they are in danger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dangerous? This is probably the most unhelpful kind of help. "You sit down and make things clear," he patted her shoulder. "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We...the place where we hide is now!" Amy gasped a few breaths and said intermittently, "A large number...the patrol surrounded the orphanage and blocked the nearby neighborhood. I saw More than one team of knights... searching for witches by the streets, others are trapped inside... ask you to rescue them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Except you and Annie, are there other witches?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are heroes and broken swords, the hero has no legs, usually can only rely on Annie to carry Action."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is enough trouble, actually hidden four? He secretly took a sigh of relief. "How did you escape?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The food at the residence is almost gone, I just went to buy some food nearby, come back ... When they came back, they were everywhere!" Her voice had already brought some crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the moment, he was caught in a dilemma. The ash ambassador was only empty and had no real power. How can he stop the patrols? What's more, this arrest was based on the command of the Lord of the Morning. He just touched the other side of the temple and now stands up to cover the witch. The result is probably not as simple as expelling the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, they won't have anything to do," comforted Amy's back on the 76th. "They must have a way to get them." Bring it back safely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are strange! Listen to your own words and vote for Roland early, don't you have nothing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about Mr. Hill?" Otto asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, he never reports to me, and often sees people for a long time," Joel frowned. "If you want to find him, I am afraid." I have to wait until after dinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This way... I will first go to Count Quinn, who is the king’s prime minister and is responsible for managing the patrol. Maybe it can Give them a chance to escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, will he listen to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I don't know, but I have to give it a try," Otto showed a complicated look. "Remember the witch friend I told you? Her name is Andrea Quinn, it is Count Quinn. The biological daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is just a little bit past, except for the station Looking out the window, nothing can be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventy-sixth screaming of amazing comfort, and the shocked and scared Amy was letting her sleep on the bench. It can be seen that this guy is running all over the place and is too anxious, and the spirit is already very exhausted. Even so, if you can fall asleep in this place, you can only say that she does... too easy to believe in others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening, Hill Fox finally returned to the ambassador’s house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it’s two and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is half a head taller than Hill, with some blood on his face, and his bright eyes are full of vigilance. "Black money" saved Anne from Hill. She was carrying a purple woman behind her, probably for the sake of convenience. The woman tied two straps from her waist to her shoulder and tied it to Annie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to her empty trousers, it should be the hero who lost his legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last person is similar to the 76th, the length of the shoulder is close to silver, the look is a little wilting, and the waist is crumbling, seems to be hit hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have all escaped... Great!" Amy, who was awakened by the sound, was stunned and then threw herself into Annie's arms with excitement." No one was hurt by the group of knights?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am fine, only the broken sword... Her magic loss is a bit big."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm so worried about you..." Amy finally couldn't help her emotions and sobbed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With Anne Sister, don't be afraid." The hero comforted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you run into them?" Joel grew up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking long, they must get out of here," Hill grabbed the ambassador’s hand and took him alone to the bedroom. "Listen." As the city gate is not closed, you have to leave the Glow City tonight, and I have already prepared the carriage. There are five cars in total. The first two are for wheat and fruit, and the last three are for transporting people -" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute," Joel interrupted. "You just said... "You"? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's you and the witch, not including me," Hill said in a word. "In order not to obstruct the plan of our Majesty, we can't lose the news of the morning." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I am an ambassador! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you are an ambassador, you must leave." The more this time, the more calm Hill’s voice is. "Listen well, these three." The witch was not saved by me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? "Yu can't help but see, "Isn't you?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is always the eyeliner that I have laid near the knight's martial arts field. If you can't find the witch, you may want to see how the opponent is looking for it, so they are out. I received the news. However, when it arrived at the destination, the neighborhood was surrounded by layers, and only the Black Street mouse had a way to enter. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you bought the mouse again? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since arriving in the morning, I have been in touch with the local mice. Although the cost is not small, it can always play a role at a critical time. Hill said, "but when I used the mice I bought to find their tracks, the three had already left the encirclement." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this not very good?" I asked Denise to send them away, and I have never had anything to eat..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not normal," Hill shook his head, "Dawn The Lord apparently knows exactly where the witch is hiding, and the mobilized people are enough to turn the fenced area up to the sky. How did they escape? There is only one explanation that makes sense - the witch is deliberately released, perhaps Anpe wants to capture more hidden witches in this way... or find those who stand behind the witch to support them. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the pharynx.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If that's the case, you stay in Hui Gwangcheng is too dangerous, and leaving as early as possible is the safest choice. Hill continued, "If you can bring back four witches for your majesty, this credit is much higher than that of an ambassador." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you..." He hesitated, "If you were caught..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can only catch a famous person with a surname, and I am a nameless person hidden in the shadows. In their eyes, I simply don't exist. Hill chuckled. "No one will notice that there is one less guard in the ambassador's team, and Otto will cover up for me." Remember when I told you? I am just an ordinary acrobat, and I will see a new acrobatic group next time when you come to the next morning, just in this bustling city of glow. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
