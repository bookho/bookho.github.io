			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finalizing the reward, Roland intends to push another wall on the road to development. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the standard unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No winter city education has already included millimeters, centimeters, meters, kilometers and other distance units in the textbook to replace the original inch, ruler, and It is still quite effective. Especially in the construction and industrial production sectors, measuring instruments made with new units have been widely recognized because of their accuracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-centimeter reference original, that is, an iron bar equivalent to the width of Roland's nails, is kept in the castle study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing he has to do is to integrate other units together and promote them to the Grey Fort nationwide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this step is done now is because the previous production and education levels are not urgent for other new units, and the second is technically difficult. engraved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, there is no point in empty standards. If you can't make measuring instruments, people can't use them in real life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these difficulties are no longer a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, define a cubic decimeter of a container as one liter, and define the weight of one liter of water as one kilogram; for example, make a one-meter long single pendulum The period of one swing is defined as one second... The former can use the hummingbird to accurately copy the equal weight of the original, while the latter can provide the timing through the pendulum clock. As long as the original and the model are available, the factory in Wintertown can produce a large number of imitations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than relying on Anna alone to do all the measurement tools, wasting time and wasting energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When industrial technology reaches a certain level, the popularization of more precise units of measurement becomes a matter of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not worried that these standards are not "pure". In fact, the standard originals used in human history are constantly changing and changing over time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, Iron Axe finally led the Eastern Army back to No Winter City At the same time, I have been waiting for a reply in the clear water port for nearly half a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at the two Shamins who reported to him at his desk, and he was slightly sighed in his heart--the two were originally sinners of the exile family, and one was incognito Flowing to Bianbu Town, relying on hunting for a living; one person was sold as a slave and lived a tormented life. But now, they are an indispensable member of the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only shouldering heavy responsibilities, after a few months of busy work, the face of the iron axe did not show any exhaustion, but because the war became radiant, it’s already The wind of the generals. The change of the echo is more obvious. The shadow caused by the slave career fades away. The blue-gray eyes have a confident luster, and the temperament is more consistent with the status of her proud head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the experience can change a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of the echo is very simple, the mad flame clan fulfilled the agreement, the first migration team has been stationed in the clear water port. Influenced by the first clan of Tiesha City, several small clans later found her and expressed their willingness to work for the Grand Chief. The whole plan was very smooth. After receiving the heads of various parties, the migration population of Bishui Port is expected to reach 30,000 by the end of the year. This is the number that can match the old king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, she also brought a personal letter from Sperer, the lord of the Dragon Ridge. I don’t have to look at it, I must know that I have to ask for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speer said that she is only a small-scale manager, and she has not taken care of the experience of so many people. This time she is almost overwhelmed." Imitating the other's tone, "the skilled hand of the city hall is easy to use. According to their suggestion, at least two or three hundred clerk will be required to resettle so many migrants. If you leave you, don't take care of her." She all wanted to drop the burden and rush to the winter city as an ordinary witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but laugh, ordinary witch It’s not equal to leisure. Soroya and the leaves are looking at you. Do not use the magic power every day, how to use the magic channel so easy to use. "I know, the next batch of new officials who have passed the review, I will give it to her more. This task is hard for you, let's take a few days off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
