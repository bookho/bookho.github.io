			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the constant pull of the Devil's King City, the attack on the floating island has become more and more fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the very beginning of the day, to the current hours, often the last wave of attacks has not yet ended, and the second wave appears on the skyline again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only after the night, the floating island will usher in a moment of peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unfinished engineering and ground facilities have been basically shut down, the construction team has put all the manpower and energy on the repairing runway, but facing the enemy like a tide The offensive, Roland did not dare to let the empty knights do more chasing, which made the pressure fall on Eleanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another change is that the number of high-order devils is also increasing rapidly, both of which are known for their strength, and for their ability to be different and unpredictable. The drone gun tower suffered losses, which further amplified the defensive pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next afternoon, the enemy first broke into the floating island - after several high-level devils opened the sealing gate with the magic blade, Ellie Nuo immediately issued an intrusion alert. The witch who is armed to the teeth constitutes the second line of defense. The two sides smash in the narrow aisle. This scene is like the battlefield preset by the federation hundreds of years ago, but the entire position of the two sides is reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Akaris’s vision, the sorcerer’s witch is the spear of the devil’s position and the key to destroying the obelisk and the mother. Only when the enemy is defeated and destroyed, human beings have the hope of winning. In the floating island, the devil has become the offensive side, and the gods only need to block the pace of their advancement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, their strength standards have not been reduced by this - in a sense, the gods of witches are the nemesis raised for high-level enemies. The demon who was banned was hard to take any advantage in a group of ancient witches who were similar to the extraordinary and not afraid of pain, not to mention the guns in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, despite the absolute disadvantage of numbers, they still block the enemy from the core area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there are also traces of the devil's forces on the ground, most of which are spider-shaped beasts. First, there are a few scattered pieces, and now a small piece of "black otter" has been integrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s like an ant waiting for a corpse." Aegusa looked at the scene below the floating island and muttered, "If we fall, they It will surely rush and tear everyone into pieces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More devils are still on the road, it seems that the enemy wants to surround us." Felice The look is also quite dignified. "In the past, the Federation wanted to completely defeat the devil by an extraordinary force. It is a bit naive to see this idea now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Even if there is no mask and its symbiotic army, this number is not what the federation can eat..." The ice witch closed her eyes. "We are too small to watch the battle of God."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you have kept at least hope." Roland patted her on the shoulder with relief. Regardless of the ending of the Witch Empire, after humans have experienced two complete defeats, they still retain the fire of resistance instead of giving up completely. This is not easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty!" At this time, the film came with a piece of the latest information. "The devil's floating city route has changed and seems to turn to us!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the reporter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the lightning lady of the expedition. She also said At the same time, the other party expanded the patrol range of the beasts. She and Mai Hao could no longer stay in the vicinity for monitoring. Finally, Miss Light mentioned that there was an amazing magical reaction overflow under the Wangcheng, even if she was not good at perceiving the magic. They all noticed the scorching atmosphere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn't help but look at Aegusa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know..." Shaking his head, "But since the magic is so concentrated, it is definitely not something simple."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
