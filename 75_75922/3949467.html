			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot air balloon flies at a height of more than two thousand meters, which is the distance measured by the lightning vertical flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as she raises her head, she can see the clouds that are close at hand, like a loose cotton, but if I want to actually touch it, I have to Fly up hundreds of meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire hot air balloon is painted with blue and white color blocks, which look exactly the same from the sky from a distance. And I also put on camouflage clothing, even "Dongfeng No. 1". According to His Royal Highness, this surprise attack must be sudden and concealed, so the First Army got off the boat when it had not reached the Silver Light City Pier and walked to the back of the nearby mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the surveillance of Sylvie, the team's course of action avoided all eyes and did not attract anyone's attention from beginning to end. After the camp was completed, the next day, the squadron slowly lifted off and began to perform the throwing mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculating a week spent on the road, today is just the beginning of the Mid-Autumn Festival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white shadow flying in front of the balloon is the wheat stubble. Due to the inconvenience of observation in the hanging basket, she took the task of guiding and investigating. After becoming a white-tailed goshawk, even at high altitudes, she can quickly identify the roads connecting the towns and the carriages that run on the roads - at this point, the eagle eye is much better than the lookout mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the other party can't fix the bomb drop, lightning thinks, or you really have nothing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you tired?" Anna asked in the hanging basket. "Come in and have a rest. There will be no devils anyway."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl shook her head. "With this speed I can fly all day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a bit? Tight?” Wendy also leaned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It won't," she grinned. "I have practiced it many times. If I say that the palace is so big, it is impossible to be partial."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Wendy smiled. "No matter what, don't be reluctant, Your Highness said that safety is of the utmost importance. And...when going to investigate the Devil's Camp, it happened. It’s not your fault.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What, I...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is gentle The tone said, "Who can see the frustration of your days, but you are not fighting, but you are not good at fighting. If you change to me, you may not be better than you." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed, the reaction and skill of the nightingale, most witches do not have it," Anna also comforted. "You still come in and take a break, wait for adjustment." The magical cost of the bomb landing is not small."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See both people saying that lightning lightly screamed from the nose, pull Head flying into the basket. Before he landed, Wendy broke into his arms. "No one will blame you, so you don't have to blame yourself, you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hmm..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a morning flight, McMug patted his wings Returning to the lookout, I reported to the three people: "The Grey Fortress is in front, we are coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning flies out of the basket and lifts the lookout Mirror - As stated by His Royal Highness, the magnificent walls of the king are clearly recognizable even in the sky. It is like a thin blue line that squirms the city's range. In the center of the gray color block, the white spots of the nail size are particularly eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan, they should first throw flyers and throw Dongfeng No.1. However, several trials found that it was impossible to control the direction of paper falling at a height of two kilometers, even if heavy objects were installed. If you reduce the altitude of the airdrop, it is easy to be found. After all, the size of the telescope is huge, and the sky is constantly falling, so it is difficult to hide itself under the watch of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the prince of the prince finally canceled the flyer section and handed it over to Tassa to promote the news, they just need to cast the bomb above the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
