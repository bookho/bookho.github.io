			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you in the king's main saltpeter?" Roland cut into the title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Your Highness," Margaret is no longer a formulaic smile at the moment, and the words are more intimate. "I run a lot of things, from gems." To the cloth, from the hotel to the pub. In fact, I did not buy saltpeter a month ago. It was only the original owner of the furnace that lost the trousers in my casino and had to mortgage the site to me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only sells all kinds of goods, but also services... What exactly does this businessman come to? You must know that you can open a casino in Wangdu, not only if you have money. He knocked on the table, but the night was in the middle - which meant that the other person carried a stone of divine punishment and could not judge whether he was lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait... Since it is impossible to observe, why did she smack her right side before she? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland coughed twice and held back the urge to turn back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has heard that some merchants from the fjord have settled in the four kingdoms, and the wealth they have accumulated is hard to imagine. After all, the sea people are born businessmen, very adventurous and at the same time have a keen sense of smell, good at capturing business opportunities. Many people have been cut as wool after they have made their homes, and some have successfully established their footholds and bought local relationships to form a more stable interest alliance. Is it that one of the big dogs is a big dog? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, Roland decided to make a straightforward request. "I need a lot of saltpeter, the more the better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Kingdom of the Kingdom is not a hot place, especially in the small town near the desolate mountains. Your High School, do you really need so many saltpeter?" She curiously said, "In the suburbs of Wangdu, I It has three furnaces to supply ice for a nobleman in a medium-sized city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-seat system! Roland was overjoyed and there was no change in his expression. "I plan to build a cold storage in the basement of the castle to store some fragile food. If you give the right price, I will have these saltpeters." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you have said this," she nodded. "I can ship all the saltpeter to Bianbu Town and only charge 90% of your market price. But... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't really want Jinlong, they are all quick My warehouse is full. I heard that you have some very strange products here. If you can, can you use these instead of Golden Dragon? I will be happy to reach a deal with you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Peculiar product?" Roland groaned, he was the first to hear that someone did not want Jinlong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, such as the black iron creation that can run on its own," Margaret leaned forward slightly. "Your servant said that this thing only needs to be ignited. Water, it has amazing power. In fact, I just heard this and decided to come to Bianbu Town personally. Otherwise, it would be more in my interest to sell the saltpeter directly to the Wangdu nobles. The farther the distance is, The loss I have suffered is also greater."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really an unexpected surprise, Roland thought. Although I don't know how Barov's apprentices got on this line and how to talk about the steam engine, it is obvious that this Wangdu merchant is full of interest in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amazing profitability of industrialized products is very clear to him, especially the mechanical products that only he can make. He was also worried that after Bianbu Town no longer sold the ore, the coins that had been moved from the Dukeâ€™s House were always useful, and I did not expect an excellent opportunity to be in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out," the prince smiled. "What you said is called a steam engine. It converts the steam produced by boiling water into power. The principle is simple." But only Bianbu Town can produce."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does this thing really exist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Roland said. "But it's very complicated to make and the price is quite expensive. If you are interested, you can follow me to see the real thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am very happy," she said excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
