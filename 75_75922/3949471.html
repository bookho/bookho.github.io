			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this situation, another captive turned and fled backwards, which made Jielu appear a little disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned into a glimpse of light, broke into the body of the captive, the other side immediately stopped the steps, his eyes turned white, and then the body had a strange change - This kind of scene, Mayn is not the first time I saw it, but no matter how many times I watched it, I couldn't help but raise a chill in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw the faint light coming out of the captive body, the body twisted and deformed, and finally became the appearance of the pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that this is not a simple substitute or killing, but what happened in the process of change, I am afraid only the pope and the parties will understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo took a deep breath and walked back to the last prisoner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the youngest of the three captured spies, probably only fourteen and five years old, with a slightly shocked and fearful eyes. I can't believe what happened just now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, there is only you left." She whispered, "Ayr."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When I heard this, the boy who wanted to pick up the scimitar was suddenly stunned. "Why, why..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The god told I have everything, you were originally a child of a farmer in the suburbs, but because of the order of the Wolf King, all the people in the village were forced to move into the city, taking up the repair of the city walls, building military needs, transporting grain and other labor. They are not because of your young age. Just letting you go, but recruiting you into the investigation team, but actually letting you kill yourself," she reached out and touched the other's cheek. "The best evidence is that you first returned to the church army. At the time of the intelligence, the captain of the guard did not let you in, but after listening to the report, let you continue to follow us, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I ......" Ayr opened his mouth, but could not say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They certainly won’t let you in, because your family doesn’t exist anymore, your parents or your brothers are just like you, but the wolf king. Consumables, if you let go, wouldn’t it be that the reconnaissance team is well known?” Jie Luo continued, “Your father accidentally fell and died while filling the gap in the wall. Your mother was caught in the supervision team. It’s dangerous to go to the whipping punishment. No gods look at it all, the evils of the world are always flowing like sewage, are you sure you want to live for such a ruler?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He can't help but widen his eyes, and his face is filled with grief that can't be suppressed. "This...no, you are lying to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gods never lie," the pure man shook his head. "You know the bottom of my heart. I am telling the truth. The root of all this is that the nobility has never treated you as a true kind, but it is a livestock that has been taken for." What we have to do is to end all these evils and injustices. A new world under the supervision and guardianship of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai slammed down to the ground and buried a headache and cried, "What should I do?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow your heart, only the gods can make a ruling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He whimpered Said: "I am wrong, I am willing to tell you everything I know, as long as I can save my mother, I am willing to do anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"乖Children, "Jielu patted his head, took a plant full of slender leaves from his pocket and handed it to him. "Come on this and get a good night's sleep. It can help you stabilize your mood," she tore off. Half a leaf, chewed in your mouth, "Like me. When the Wolf Heart City is broken tomorrow, you may see your mother again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mean frowned, the plant is the sleeping fern used to configure the dream water, the witch has no effect on raw food, but it is a very severe poison for ordinary people. You must use winter flowers and toxicity. Sure enough, after the captives ate, it didn't take long for his face to become iron blue. He grabbed his throat and looked at the smiling Xiaolu with a smile. The snoring sound in his throat. Soon the nails broke the skin and blood vessels, and the spilled blood dyed the neck bright red. After he struggled for a quarter of an hour, he gradually softened and stopped breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
