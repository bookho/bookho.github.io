			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort West, north of the Long Song Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Sirte sat by the fireplace and looked serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss. Celt left the house yesterday and had no news until the next morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has some bad feelings in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent Miso and the Western family have come very close, and the honeysuckle family who hosted the fortress also released the wind, saying that His Royal Highness intends to integrate the West, then the various territories Both will use the same law, and at the same time take back the power of the great aristocracy - this means that they can not expand their subordinate aristocracy, nor can they recruit the knight to fight for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the little aristocrats like Sirte, there is not much impact, and there are even many benefits. After all, the sound of the wind, as long as one heart loyal to the prince of the prince, can get a rich return. Therefore, at this time, the small aristocracy has become the most stable group. No matter whether the reform plan of the Highness is successful or failed, they can accept it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it’s the smartest thing to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comeso. Celtic does not think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master, went out to find the second master's attendant," the butler pushed the jazz's study door and said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are you, have you found him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the butler shook his head "The taverns, casinos, theaters and brothels of the fortress have been searched, but the traces of the young masters have not been found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Sirte is anxious, The people who sent out to find Miso were divided into two batches. The first batch went to the nearby small aristocratic territory. Most of them were knights of the Duke of Ryan, and their status was similar to that of their own. Therefore, Miso often went to these territories to attend some gatherings. Dinner or something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second batch is the entertainment venue in the fortress city, which is where the young nobles love to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that both groups of people are returning empty-handed, the jazz’s bad premonition is getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got up and walked to the window and looked at the east of the territory - after crossing the two jazz collars in this direction, it was the site of the elk family, and it was also the largest in the west. Earl of the Territory. Since the fall of the Duke of Ryan, the Peacock of the honeysuckle family has completely fallen to the Four Princes, and the Elk family has become a leader against the prince's forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, Miso should not go there...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master, two young masters Come back!" Suddenly a waiter ran into the study. "He is changing clothes in the lobby. It seems that he is going to go out again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!" The Jazz immediately picked up The crutches around me, walking away from the downstairs, did not care about the discouragement of the housekeeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just entering the hall, Silter suddenly felt a scream in his head - I saw Miso take off his thick coat and put on a thin one. Soft leather, in front of him, placed a set of shining knights. The two squatters were preparing for the final wear of the armor after they were busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you go yesterday!" The old jazz couldn’t help but yell, "What are you going to do now?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, our opportunity is coming," Miso said excitedly. "From the lowest level of the knight to the baron... even the chance of the Viscount!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silter feels bloody in his heart, "Who said this to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jacques Meade, he Brought the secret of His Majesty the King!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Sylt couldn't help but step back two steps, one heart sinking to the bottom. Jacques Meade is the eldest son of the elk family, not to mention the new king, Tiffco. Everyone knows that the enemy that the latter wants to eradicate most is probably Roland Wimbledon who is in charge of the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
