			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the different time and flow rates, a single sleep can basically span two days. After Roland arranged the derelict witch on the next day, he drove with a three-person The place to go to the city center - Crown Hotel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, what can you really eat anywhere?" Yann looked out from the back seat and his eyes went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, there is no difference between the banquets of the nobles. In the era of the federation, you should have never attended such a banquet?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But those banquets are not ready to let go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't you?" Roland is curious. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," nodded in the co-pilot's San Milano. "The people who can be invited to the banquet are all faces and faces. It is more important than eating. Feelings. No one wants to talk with people who are full of oily eyes. Whoever let go of their stomachs will only sneer. If the banquet is long, most people will choose to eat the meal before going to the banquet." Speaking, "If such behavior would damage the face of the underarm, we can completely endure it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland squinted from the rearview mirror People want to talk and stop, secretly look forward to, can not help but laugh out, "Reassured, when do I talk is not counted? This is not the Federation, nor the gray castle king, we play the role of this It’s an ordinary person, as long as you don’t bother others, you can eat whatever you want.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... can I sneak back with some food?" Excited, "There are many sisters who want to experience the banquet level of the world."<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be discovered." He didn't think. "When you follow me, don't leave me too far. If someone meets, I will not hear it. Let me come." Cope."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty!" The three witches share the same voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After almost half an hour, the group arrived at the destination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he entered the door, Roland felt the difference. Parked in the vestibule of the hotel, almost all of the luxury cars, at least a million, the clean paint of the car is like a mirror, compared to the van he opened is quite a bit eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the looting of the demon is a lot of money, it is still several orders of magnitude worse than the real capitalist, and in the eyes of unobtrusive thoughts, he The bought van is just an ordinary brand, and it won't make people look more and more. However, here he became the most eye-catching one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Today, the hotel does not accept outsiders. Do you have an invitation?" The car was parked at the door and the guest quickly walked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland swayed the cards that Garcia had given him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the Crown Hotel, the venue is located on the top floor, there is a special reception in the lobby." The other party immediately showed a warm smile, "Please let me park for you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end is the benchmark of the city's star-rated hotels, Roland secretly feels, regardless of the thoughts of these people, on the surface is still polite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the witches walking into the magnificent lobby, the reaction of the three was lighter than he expected. The spacious and bright buildings are not unusual in the Takira era. After all, the glowing magic stone once spread to the upper layers of the witch empire. For example, the crystal chandelier that was worth seeing at the top of the head was replaced by a palace with three seats. It is estimated to be unusual. Just what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland felt a little funny when he thought that this palatial decoration was not as good for them as a few cream cakes. However, the appearance of the witch has attracted the attention of several people. It seems that no matter which world they are in, their appearance is enough to be the focus of everyone's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the inspection was more detailed, the receptionist scanned the card and reported two sentences with the intercom, which handed the invitation card back to him, "Mr. Roland Sorry to have kept you waiting. I would like to ask these three ladies are yours..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, please come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The receptionist sent the three people into the elevator, pressed the button on the top floor, and then squatted outside the door. "I wish you a good time tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevator suddenly lit up after a closed drive, and the wall that originally surrounded them suddenly disappeared. At the foot, the afterglow of the sun sets into the elevator, and at the same time, there are also high-rise buildings. A building has an uninterrupted horizon between the buildings. Even looking at the end of the horizon, it is still the "wall of the building". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, the witches made a low-pitched exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if the three holy cities add up, there is no such a big city," 潼 whispered. "It’s hard to imagine no matter how many times you look at it." The magical mortal can create this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The miracle building you want to build, also has the meaning of commemoration inside?" St. Milan looked at Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled undecidedly. Although he did not tell anyone about him except Anna, his coming from a place like the dream world has become the consensus of the Takira witches - otherwise he could not explain why he is so familiar with this incredible world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reaching the top floor, a large circular ballroom appeared in front of four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the ground, its walls and domes are almost entirely made up of glass walls, and the view is extremely wide. Standing on the wall, you can see more than half of the city. There is a small feeling of the mountains. It is possible to hold a banquet in such a place, which shows the strength of the Sanye Group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table in the hall is full of all kinds of food for people to choose from, from cold cuts to pastries, fruits and champagne towers; guests are twos and threes. The number of people gathered together is almost a few hundred. It is obvious that they are not only martial arts, but also business or political figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style of such a banquet, he will feel very restrained in the past, but now Roland has become accustomed to enter the hall with the witches to go straight to the theme - That is a table meal in the back row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow... this fillet is so tender, it tastes like it melts in your mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really a grape? Ah, I haven’t felt this sweet for a long time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Less nonsense, you came only last month Going through the world of dreams?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time you eat is a fast food, the idiot of Elena will only be called Kaifeng and blue road." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don’t you eat it, do you want to put something in your pocket?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Roland looked at the swallowing, excited witches, smiled and shook his head. He suddenly felt that even if the dream world could not bring him any benefit, he should let it continue to survive here - for him, this may be a dispensable nothingness, but for the survivors of Takira Say, it is the only place where you can feel that you are still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taste, touch, smell...all they have lost to fight the devil, only to get compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the dinner has not yet officially started, Roland carefully looked at other guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attendees are basically divided into two factions. The basics of wearing formal attire are people from the social circle, and wearing robes of the martial arts association is basically a peer. Although this division is not necessarily accurate, for example, just because he just became a full member but did not issue a robes can only wear formal attire, but in general, no one in the hall is a strange dress, or dressed up, and last time The sights seen in the city of Prism are diametrically opposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the difference between awakened and wild awakened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but think of what Garcia had said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the martial arts association is an organization determined to save the world, it is impossible to gather enough people with ideals. The emergence of the Fighting World - which has been in existence for less than 50 years, has become the most watched sporting event. Through the competition, the awakened can get more exposure, fame and income, and the event has also entered countless counties for the association. The new blood, which makes the fighting in the association more and more important, the outstanding performance also has a higher voice. The change even caused the upper level of disagreement, the members of the association are gradually divided into two new and old people. In the end, the Fighting Games not only did not shrink, but further expanded the scale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
