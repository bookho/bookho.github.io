			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Demon!" Allexia took off her two-handed sword and held it in front of Mira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the demon?" Her tone was cold and she had almost no feelings. "The orphans and abandoned babies were transported to the monastery to raise the witches, and you What is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What are you talking about!” the female warrior scolded. “The church accepts them for the kindness of the gods. If there is no monastery, they How many people can live through adulthood? However, the perverted devil will always erode among those who are weak, and will lead a few people to astray. Once someone is found to be a witch, the church will deal with it immediately. You completely reverse the cause and effect!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the word "handling" was heard, the golden eyes of the witch were dimmed a bit. She raised the sword with one hand. "I convinced a dead man." There is not much interest, just like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, the owl flies up, her figure has rushed to the front, Eleania remembers deeply The teammate who was opened with a sword was horrified, and did not retreat, towards the extraordinary. At the bottom right, in the sword training class, the instructor has mentioned it more than once. The right hand is the most difficult position to look at in the lower right. Because of the limited posture of the sword, you want to turn the direction of the blade. , need to spend extra time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexia shunned the witch’s straight as a leopard, and when she passed over the other side, she crossed her hands and tried to make Counterattack. But the reaction of the extraordinary is astonishingly fast - a light jump, it is easy to avoid this sweep, while turning to pick a giant sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, Eleanor has not even landed completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is between the electric and the flint, and the half of the calf flies with the blood. The tearing pain came from under her body and almost made her lose consciousness. With the instinct to bite the teeth, the female warrior was not called out on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap is too big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She now understands how powerful it is to be able to compete with the extraordinary for the top ten swords and give yourself the opportunity to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ailesia struggled to turn over and saw that Mila took a handle from her back and raised her hand to focus on herself. Extraordinary witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last chance, she realized that she might be able to attract her attention! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior just wants to say something, the giant sword has been swept like a whirlwind, she only feels the throat tight, then the world is reversed... no, maybe She flew up, and she saw her body falling down with powerlessness. She also saw an owl swooping toward Mira, and in midair she became a girl, kneeling on the official... The line of sight quickly blurred, eventually falling to the ground and falling into the boundless darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This damn stone!" Mai Hao touched his head The bag, blaming, "You are too careless, if you don't have me, then you will shoot you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, I have noticed that I am only planning to make a quick decision." The ashes used a big sword to quickly dig a shallow pit, dragged the two into the pit, and covered it with mud. The stone of Shendu and Jinlong were all collected by her, so that the toll to Bishui Port would be there. She also found a letter from a woman wearing a robes of the gods, which was roughly viewed. The content was that if the western lord Roland Wimbledon did not collude with the witch, he asked him to buy a baby girl and an orphan. Prior to this, the other side of the deal was the Duke of Lane. As long as the underage women are within the scope of purchase, they can pay at the "market price" or they can use the pill price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading, the sneer sneered, put the letter paper on the torch and ignited it, and burned it directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go, we still have a bunch of bodies to bury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕." The wheat owl returned to the owl and took the ashes to the first attack site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digging, carrying, burying people... These physical laborers can’t help too much, and the broken limbs and the bloody suffocation make her a bit Dizzy, had to fall on the branches, watching the ashes busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
