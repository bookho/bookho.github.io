			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyro leaned toward the crowd, "What happened?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hermon," someone saw the honeysuckle family badge on his chest. "We are talking about the lords of Bianbu Town. He confiscated the fortress nobles." The property in the town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call me to be ape, what is the specific situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I will explain it to Mr. Pei Luo," Simon squeezed forward, revealing a flattering smile. "This is the case. We are in the life of the Dukes. We usually live in Bianbu Town and manage the North for the main house." Every year in the winter, we will bring the townsmen back to the long song fortress to protect them from evil beasts. This year, the demon moon is over, one of my colleagues, the Fletcher family's 寇ris is actually told by the Bianbu town lord His house has been demolished by the townspeople and there is no compensation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Either admit that the house does not belong to you, or send you to the cell, defect Sin is hanged," he imitated the words of the four princes Roland. "Mr. You listen, what is the crime of defection, this is Every mine manager has done things in the past year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puer’s brain can’t help but recall the appearance of the young gray-haired man, even though the prince Extremely unbearable, but in terms of his two personal touches, Roland Wimbledon is by no means a general. The crime of defection in this treatment method is just one reason that the other party can find it at random - the prince did not think about convincing the people with reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has completely broken with the long song fortress, Pei Luo thought, or think deeply, the prince will not know that every year the townspeople and nobles have to go to the fortress to take refuge ? Obviously not. He clearly knows, but he has to impose a crime, forcing the other party to make a choice, and let the other party pass the result of such brutal treatment back to the long song fortress. What does the prince want to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But he is the lord of Bentham," said the man who had laughed at Simon before. "The lord has the power to decide the law in the territory."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bianyi Town is also under the jurisdiction of the West!" Simon said in disappointment, "Do you question the authority of Ryan's adults? In the town to supervise mine work, It is the meaning of an adult. Now Roland takes all the noble houses as their own, this is to openly confront the six people, and Ryan will never sit back and watch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What you are talking about is the executioner who did not give the documents after the suffocation of Hills Meade?" I don't know when Rennes came over. "My father is furious about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Made," Simon said. "It’s this person. Now he is more mad, I’m afraid only the Duke can stop him. I hope you can do it for us. Transfer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, whether or not this is the case, Ryan Everyone is ready to do something to him.” Ryan didn’t care. “I came back for this, my brother is negotiating a trade in Wangcheng, and I can only lead the elk family.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? That would be great." Simon said with delight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer frowned. Although he knew that since the instrument was issued in the winter, when the prince chose to stay in Bianbu Town, there would be such a day sooner or later. But he did not expect his friends to be armed. Regardless of the strange eyes, he pulled Ryan directly to the side and discouraged: "You don't want to go, that's the prince."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know he is the prince "The prince in the mountains," said Rennes Meade, patted Peero’s shoulder. "Reassure, Ryan will not hurt a prince. Maybe we will surrender directly as soon as we pass. Even if we want to resist As long as we are on the rush, do the peasant miners not run out? The four princes will not shoot with a knife, I guess he can't hurt a hair."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I am worried that you are hurt by him... Pei Luo opened his mouth, but did not say it, he knows that the other party will not believe in himself, because even he himself is hard to believe, the prince can rely on The miners defeated the coalition of the Dukes. I don't know why, there is always some anxiety in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Pi Luo, your father let you go back, he has something to look for." A white-haired butler suddenly rushed to Pedro By the side, the ear said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know," Peero nodded, and after saying goodbye to Rennes, he took the carriage with the butler and returned to the Earl of Honeysuckle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
