			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be honest, I don't know." Wajilis's eyes did not make the slightest evasion. "This is not the same as I expected. You care." That's exactly what it is, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has defaulted on it - he has discovered that nightmares have an indescribable insight into the human heart, even if In the martial arts association, it is also very popular today, and it can be said that it has been a spurt. In front of such people, pretending to be confused is not very useful, and straightforward is the most effective way to negotiate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the judgment of the other party, the appearance of the god of God means that the Lord of Heaven has made up his mind, and since it opened its mouth to the king, it is basically cut off. The possibility of pulling together. Unless it destroys this floating land, it will never return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accordingly, Hecksod, who is suspicious, will always pay close attention to the frontline, and it is impossible to take action until you show enough strength. "Wakirith is like talking to himself, and seems to be skeptical about his heart. "Now it is uncharacteristic and has reached some kind of consensus with Cerroshhi. It is not surprising that you are vigilant." But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What if the situation changes?" It is a hand-to-hand, "the world is impermanent, no matter how appropriate the decision, it will become meaningless to leave the corresponding conditions. I can only speculate, perhaps other factors, making Heckzod change his original intention." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you don't know what it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, even you I don’t know, I’m even less likely to know.” Wakiris took a sip of coffee again. “If you don’t ask, you can’t guess anything here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you have to write again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is indeed a method, but from I suspect that the time will be quite long. The conditions at this moment will also change. These uncertain factors will bring uncertain risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roland was silent for a moment, then looked at Wakiris with some playfulness. "Are you inducing me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The decision is always in your hands." The latter's look was unexpectedly calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Roland did not answer immediately. He shrugged and changed a topic. "Right, why do you only talk about Heckzod, and almost Don't mention the silence? Can it not be part of the 'other factors'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I understand it." Wajilis Suddenly there was a sigh in the eyes, and it looked out the window. "Convincing Hecksod needs a lot of reasons, but convincing it is not needed. As long as it knows that I am still alive, I will not stand by."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of God, the bottom of the pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this really work?" Silently stared at the owner of the Scorpio, who closed his eyes in the pool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, maybe not." After a few days of rest, Heikezod has recovered a lot more than before. "But since you can't think of it." A better way, then you can only try your luck first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It knows that if you want your opponent to stand firm on your side, you must First, resolve the two reasons for refusal proposed by the silence. The king ordered the implementation of the second plan. It was unable to reverse it, and did not dare to stand up and question the king’s strategy. The only breakthrough was in the “letter” of Wakiris. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of note and a few words are too sloppy, so more words and information? If you succeed in connecting with the Nightmare Monarch, the silence will surely become the most powerful card in its hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this plan, Heckzod not only allowed his own capable cadres to personally monitor the transmission points in the north of the morning, but also sent two nobles, respectively Going to the foothills of Hermes and the winter border is not wanting to miss any possible response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what the end result is, it has nothing at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the message takes time, and the second god of God, driven by Wang, is driving around the fertile plains around the clock. Once the second program is launched, There is no room for recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition...you should pay more attention to the mask than to care about this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong with the mask?" Silent frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know... just think it's a bit strange." Heikezod shook his head, and since it's back here, it's impossible to keep squatting. The other side, but the mask that has taken over the West Line seems to care less about its long-term disappearance, and does not suggest that it take the initiative to report to the king - in the past, this opportunity to press it over the face, The other party should not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Scorpio!" At this moment, Iasis suddenly walked into the grotto. "The human side has a movement!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So fast?" Heckzod couldn't help but be amazed. "What have you observed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It did not reveal its ideas to third parties other than silence, even if it was West Asia. So the order that was given to the people was that any abnormal movements must be reported to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A male has erected a flag on the hillside where you want to focus on surveillance, and there is nothing in his side."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vertical flag does not occupy, which is extremely abnormal in itself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod couldn’t help but look at the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only five or six days from the time the message was sent, and it’s too much difference with its expected half-month. This can only prove one thing. The witch is not only in the high position, but also close to the top of the power, otherwise there will be no such efficient response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the discovery of the eyebrows?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the witches in the area cannot get involved, In order to prevent it, it still has a symbiotic eyeguard for the West Asians. The long-range strike of the last time the blond witch suddenly appeared has left the heart of the Scorpio. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The basic sense is that there is no magic male, it should be a routine investigation of human beings, and the existence of magic observers has not yet been discovered." Next, "Adult, what are you watching out for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When all this has a result, I will tell you." Wait for West Asia to leave Afterwards, Hecksod looked at the silence, "Would you like to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you still ask?" The latter has already worn the helmet On the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the twisted door, silently walked towards the soldier under the banner . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it did not deliberately hide the figure, the other party quickly noticed the movement behind him, turned around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shen defaulted out of this male. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the last person to be delivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly a very unusual meeting. Humans do not scream, escape, or fight back, but wait quietly for it to approach. Although his breathing was obviously confusing, he did not step back in one step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the two face to face, the other party opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trusted me, my companion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They, still alive. Go back, I will release them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party nodded, took a new note from his arms and handed it to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
