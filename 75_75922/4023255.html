			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic reaction?" Earl of Delta turned back. "What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Call your knight to let it go!" Brian didn't care for the etiquette and shouted at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, a group of believers dressed in indigo robes have rushed out from the corner of the street and plunged into the knights leading the way. The attacker's impact was so great that even the horses were directly knocked over to the ground. Several knights did not react, and they were crushed by the mounts that were pressed down by the mountains. The others immediately pulled the sword forward and smashed them with the believers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people on the street shunned, many people were crushed in a panic, crying and crying for help, and the scene was a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really...reversely!" The count was surprised for a while, then angered. "Damn, kill me these rebels!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a flying bluestone made him close his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thatâ€™s part of the street paving, I saw the slate vacant, and I took it to the Cavaliers, only to see a touch of blue Shadow, the armor of the man in the shackles suddenly slammed down, and the blood came out from the gap between the visor and the joint. It was impossible to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are more slate flying out, even believers are included. The skeleton of the person in the shackles is broken, and when it is squatted, it is cut into two pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Delta was too late to express his shock and was pulled by Brian to the side of the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open fire!" The iron axe ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continuous gunshots rang through the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who stood still fell like a wheat, and there was a short space in front of the otherwise chaotic team. When the smoke was exhausted, there were only knights and believers who were lying down on the ground. Some of them had not yet broken their breath, and they shrank on the ground and suffered painful embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enemy?" Brian stared at the corner of the street with a glance, looking like an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy...doesn't they fall down?" The count was shocked and incomprehensible. Apparently he did not expect that his army was actually strong enough to reach this point, and more than a dozen silver armor knights lost their fighting ability almost in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in response to her warnings, a woman walks out of the corner, and the slate on the street rolls up like a carpet, floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intensive gunshots sounded again, the slate that had just been set up was torn apart, but there was still a bluestone plate that had been turned over, like a thick blade The sword swept across the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops! Brian's heart was cold. In the scene just seen, the musket couldn't accurately crush a flipped slate in such a short distance. He could hardly imagine the scene where the soldiers were cut - they didn't even have the armor, and the casualties would only be worse than the Cavaliers. But at this time, it can only be hard to resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost simultaneously, a purple light emerged from the front of the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cage of the magical force will cover the slate in full, and will tighten quickly and block it hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy...is the witch?" The Count of Delta was reacting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army stopped shooting until the slate that stood up fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick smoke shields the field of vision, and the air is filled with the smell of sulphur, but no one dares to blink or cough, except to change the sound of bullets. The scene was quiet and scary.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Sylvie?" asked the iron axe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic...disappeared," she said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
