			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the "long whip" formed by many tracer trajectories, the twenty millimeter cannon is undoubtedly the most conspicuous group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the higher pressure, the stickman’s stone that is squeezed and illuminated is brighter, and the tracer arrangement is much more compact than the machine, so it There is almost no gap in the flight path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fearful beast hit by the cannon has no room for struggle, and being penetrated by a glowing group means that several bullets are falling on the body at the same time - even if only In the middle of the wings, the jet will also tear a large hole in the flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, compared to the two wings, the body of the fearful beast in the dive is the normal state. Along with a mass of blood, there were several tumbling and falling down, and the madmen on them could only wait for a moment of collision with the earth, except for the last scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy was not intimidated by such a situation. They used a steep drop to increase the speed and dispersed to both sides in an attempt to get rid of the shooter's tracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly the most effective way to change to peacetime. Faced with the goal of horizontal flight, the First Army soldiers often habitually enter the "tail-hunting" shooting, even if the skilled team, it will take several seconds to adjust the advance according to the sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time they are playing with Eleanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost instantaneously, the trajectory of the beastly path has formed a new trajectory on the coordinate network. It is a solution to a myriad of algebraic equations, and these disengagements together mark the fate of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light curtain is twisted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first macro feeling of the top of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tracing trajectory is no longer straight, but is turned into a curved arc by the rapid turn of the muzzle. These arcs are intertwined like a flower rope. general. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although seemingly chaotic, each jet has its own clear goals. Their extensions are unbiased, right in front of the beastly action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t know, you will feel that the bullet is not catching up with the beast, but the beast has slammed into the bullet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think Eleanor must be very happy now," Felice said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Roland asked inexplicably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the war that Tageira fell, the first to tear the line of defense is the enemy’s beastly army. They emerge from the airspace we have hard to reach. The sub-head attacked the weakness of the line of defense. Even if the St. Benedicts went east and west, there was no guarantee that the entire wall would be foolproof. There were fewer and fewer good bed and trebuchets, and the enemy’s siege was finally torn open. "She was quite emotional." At that time, Eleanor was covered in blood and stood on the wall. There was no devil around to step closer, but the holy city behind her had already ignited a fire."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out to be the case...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she will say something like revenge for four hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if one's ability is strong enough, there is no way to save the holy city that was engulfed by the tide-like enemy. Looking back at this moment, her lazy tone suddenly added an indescribable Shendian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Eleanor is once again at the forefront of the battle of divine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time behind her is the power of all mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They split their actions!" Xiaoqing Chenguang suddenly reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the magic curtain, I saw that the group of fearful beasts that were hit by the head-on attack suddenly separated up and down, one straight to the ground of the floating island, and one to fly down. It seems to be trying to avoid the angle of the gun. Probably the devil is no longer eager to entangle in the air after discovering that conventional evasion is still not working, but intends to land as soon as possible to find cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After joining the battle is the inner ring defense line consisting of the Mark I heavy machine gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turrets are smaller, almost half a meter high, and because of the movement, the barrels are replaced with longer water-cooled tubes - these can be rotated The shooting platform is distributed on the runway, bridge, tower, etc., and it is the enemies who try to "jump the battle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madness of landing has finally launched a counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They threw the beasts that landed on the bullets and rain, threw short spears at the turret, or fired electric light, and suddenly there was an explosion above the floating island! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was surprised to find that their short spears were no longer a simple animal bone, but something else mixed, the spear tip was black, in An explosion occurs when something collides, and there is a noticeable flare and smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madness that can release the electric light is also different from that of the co-help club. Not only does the ability to perform faster, but the distance is far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously this is a well-prepared elite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If their opponent is a First Army soldier, it may still cause some confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But unfortunately there are only cold machines in the turret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They won’t panic, they won’t hesitate, they won’t stop shooting as long as they are motivated. Even if there are one or two misfires, it will not affect other turrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course this is not Ellenor’s ultimate defense – two 75mm field guns located diagonally on the floating island are also activated, pointing slowly The position of the enemy. In the face of a take-off and landing field with a diameter of one kilometer, even a small artillery can be completely covered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the firearms war that Pasha mentioned.... Eleanor thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the fighting style she is familiar with, but from the moment she fires, she likes this feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is now, the only one who is really fighting the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even if she is alone, the devil can’t avoid her gaze and attack the fragile places of the line of defense – even at the bottom of the floating island, she Four twenty-mm cannons and two lower-looking fortress guns were prepared for the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fortress without a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your tricks are here... Eleanor slightly adjusts the base, so that the field gun's crosshairs point directly to the center of the field and are suppressed by bullets. The devil, from its striking armor and attire, is a high-ranking promoter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she controlled the core to pull down the firing rope -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boom--!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reading Soso..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a roar and tremor, a sandstone fell from the top of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first army is firing on the island? Don't you?" Finkin swept the dust on his hair and looked at him with a little bit of worry. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The shelling can only blow up the runway at most, and it will not have any impact on the hangar, not to mention Miss Lian, fixing the pits is a breeze." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is a bit strange, it seems that it is not a pilot of a class. Goode, Finchem, and Heinz turned their heads and looked at them, only to find that the caller was the new ace of the newcomers, Manfred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every senior is good." He took the initiative to salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the challenger is coming." Finkin licked Guggen with his elbow and said, pressing down the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
