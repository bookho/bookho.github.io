			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days after the end of the enlarged meeting, the Iron Axe once again received instructions for a new weapon test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the northwest is likely to be attacked by evil animals at any time, the new shooting range is located on the other side of the Chishui River. When the iron axe arrives, the prince’s guards have already A hemp rope and a red flag were placed around the open space, and a checkpoint card was placed at both ends of the steel bridge to prohibit unrelated personnel from passing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, His Royal Highness is very much valued for this weapon test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly walking in the shades of different shades, looking at the friendly eyes cast by the guards, the iron axe could not help but remember the first time to participate in the gun test The scene when shooting. At that time, he was just a little-known alien sand-sand. The people of the Grey Fortress always showed his suspicion and vigilance. Even if he lived in the town for five years, he touched the surrounding hunters with his superb archery. But out of the old district, no one will look at him more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally thought that he would remain in this barren land as an Orion, not in the bed, or in the claws of the evil beast or prey. Next, I did not expect that my Highness would actually look at the body of the Shamin, and let myself see the power of Skyfire and Thunder. The next change was so fast that he couldn't make a fuss. From forming a militia team to fight against the evil beast, he was formed by the first army of Bianbu Town. He was the first commander of the first army. What is even more surprising is that because of His Royal Highness’s attitude towards witches, he once again saw the heirs of the Aosha clan in the town, and Zall, the silver moon, made up for his greatest regret in this life. With regard to this trust and appreciation, as well as compensation for his own destiny, Iron Axe has already vowed in his heart to devote all his dedication to this new master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When approaching the center of the test site, the iron axe saw the figure of His Royal Highness, and he was a little surprised that in addition to His Royal Highness and the Chief Knight, Several sleeping island witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Highness, Iron Axe reports to you!" He stepped forward and marched toward the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter nodded. "Since everyone is here, we can start." He sent two long shots to the iron axe and Carter. "This It is one of my newly developed weapons. I am still in the prototype stage, and the number is limited. Let’s take a try.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe carefully looked through the hands The new gun - its shape is very similar to the revolver rifle, the only difference is in the loading position: the new gun does not have a nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He groaned, is this gun the same as the earliest rifle, which needs to be filled from the front end of the barrel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's called a rifle," explains the Highness quickly, "The bullet uses the latest smokeless double-base emission* drug, with a caliber of 8 mm, although the runner rifle is less than 10 mm, but the power is even bigger." He turned the gun over the side. "Ammunition is inserted from the front of the trigger. Each bullet clip can be embedded with five rounds of bullets, but it can't Continuous firing like a revolver rifle requires manual retraction and captaining."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the demonstration of His Royal Highness Prince, the Axe quickly understood how the new rifle was operated. And the gun shot a clip bullet - the new gun's strength is quite large, each time the trigger is pulled, he can feel the impact of the butt on the shoulder, and the sound is much brighter than the revolver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the five shots were shot, he noticed that there was almost no smoke in front of the muzzle. If it was replaced with an old-fashioned rifle, the smoke from the five rounds of bullets would be enough to cover the line of sight. It is. This is probably the credit of the so-called "smoke-free ammunition" under the Royal Highness. However, the gun itself does not have any unique features. Compared with the huge gap between the revolver gun and the flint gun, the new rifle does not say no progress, and the iron axe even feels It is also not as good as a revolver. The most obvious thing is that the rate of fire is slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the former who can continuously fire after aiming at the target, the new gun is extremely inconvenient when standing and shooting, and the gun body has to be re-targeted after manually lifting the bullet. Although the process is much faster than the rifle, it takes a short time to suppress the enemy - for example, when cleaning up the long song fortress and rebelling the nobility, a close encounter encounters in the corner or inside the house, the new rifle is far less useful than the revolver. It is. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the iron axe 151, after his own test experience, Carter also expressed the same view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince nodded, "It is not as convenient as a revolver, but the advantages are obvious. Andrea, let me demonstrate," he will Put the rifle in the hands of the witch, "Remember to use the ability to shoot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
