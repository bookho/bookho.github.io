			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The whirlpool is so big, what strange terrain can be understood." Thunder said after a moment of silence, "I saw a piece in the wolf heart kingdom." The weathered rock mountain is similar to these stone pillars, and at most it is not so slender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be underwater without wind...Camicera I thought about it, but I didn’t say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wind?" Suddenly came the voice of Joan in her mind. "There is a wind here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" Camilla opened her mind subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, I just said it is not clear enough?" Thunder coughed twice. "Then say it again... I was in the wolf before - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not asking you, is Joan!" Camilla interrupted the other party's words. Although she was somewhat rude, she was not surprised. So much, "Jion seems to be saying... there is wind on the bottom of the sea!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the listeners on the deck could not help but be one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't feel it, but I can hear the sound of the wind... Huh-哗------you didn't hear it?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is a spiritual exchange, as long as Joan can hear it, he should be able to do it. Camilla quickly concentrated on the spirit, and sure enough, in the bottomless sea under the foot of Joan, there was a faint wind, as if the air flow quickly through the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will go down a little more," said Joan. "But you have to change your posture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing her untie the ties on the skirt, let the legs and seawater come into close contact, the cyan scales quickly emerge from the ankles and wrap the legs into a whole - a fish Type of tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Camilla felt that the resistance and the lag in front of him seemed to disappear. It was only between the tail and her body was in the water. It’s more flexible than fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Joan really looks like! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dive speed is much faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two hundred meters, the wind seems to be getting bigger... there is still no change under the water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Four hundred meters, the surroundings are completely dark...but fortunately, Joan does not rely on light to see things. Stone pillars... continue to descend, and new pillars appear."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rope used to fix the depth is over, can you still pick up a few more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn, now How deep is it? Six hundred or eight hundred? Joan is also uncertain. The words of Shizhu--" Speaking of here, Camilla, who has been presenting the situation, suddenly stopped. "No, this... how is this possible..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Thunder asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleeping housekeeper only felt an indescribable chill rising from the back and suddenly spread to the whole body. "Pillars, pillars... no more!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, does it mean disappearing?" Thunder frowned and looked at the sea - there was no change in the surrounding island reef, and it didn't look like it was not seen. It looked like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camilla took his slightly trembling hand. "There is no seabed...nothing...they are suspended in the sea!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes people breathe a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Joan’s vision, she clearly saw that several stone pillars have come to an end, but that is not to say that they have a fulcrum, but abruptly It seems that the end is flushed together, leaving only the first half quietly standing in the water. It's not just small stone pillars, but even those islands and reefs. The huge stone pier stands out from the air, and there is no support at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene is too strange, completely beyond common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The three gods are on, it can be all a piece of stone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Woman, are you sure you are not mistaken?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's impossible, even if they can float, it can't be as motionless as it is now - without anchors, the current is enough to rush the entire shadow island to the gorge Bay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deck suddenly exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up!" Thunder screamed and made others calm down. "Is all the islands and reefs floating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know...the lengths are not the same," Camilla muttered. "The new stone pillars are still extending down."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the speed of Joan’s dive has slowed down significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although her ability can counter the pressure of the deep sea, but there are limits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Camilla noticed a weird sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several pillars closer to Joan that seem to be "stretched". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the overall length - they are almost straight into the bottom of the sea like a tree trunk, and you can't see the end at all, so you don't have to say a long time. What caught her attention was the details, the lines on the pillars and the attachments of the barnacles – from the beginning, the former seemed to become more slender, while the latter gradually turned from the circle to the ellipse. Because there are normal samples within a few meters for comparison, it seems quite uncoordinated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to get close?" Joan perceives her surprise. "It's a bit strange."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Camilla cleared some dry throats, "You are careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joong slowly swims to the nearest one Next to the stone pillar, I reached out and tried to touch the weird barnacles, but the next moment was a horrible thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big butler saw that the finger covered with scales was a little longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey? What's going on?" She confuses and reaches out. "Is my hallucination?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of Carmela, there was a bad foreboding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she was about to inform the Thunder that the deep dive was temporarily suspended, a sea fish swam past the Joan eyelids. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an ordinary silver ray, about one arm long, but when it crosses the mermaid girl, its length grows at a rate visible to the naked eye, short Less than five meters, a squid became a creature similar to the "sea snake." However, this is not finished yet. Its sinking speed is still accelerating, and after a long period of time, the silver light is suddenly stretched to the limit, the tail is still in the field of vision, but the head has already plunged into the boundless darkness. The length is less than 100 meters! In the blink of an eye, it disappeared into the deep sea like a stream of light, just like what was sucked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carmela only feels scalp scalp, sweating upside down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but shouted, "Get out of there! The search is over, and it will come up immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, it’s too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe swayed a few times, but the body did not move - or her elongated speed tied the speed of the float, Camilla can see clearly The fishtail to her has grown to more than ten meters, but the width has not changed at all, and the scene is terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan’s thoughts also panicked. "I... What's wrong with me? Kamila... What should I do?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Add more effort... Don't stop, forcefully swim! You can do it!" Camilla snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all efforts are meaningless. No matter how Joan swims, her body is constantly sinking, just like being trapped in a quagmire, not just the tail at the moment. Even the body and hands are distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
