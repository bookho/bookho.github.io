			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves are walking through the treetops and the green leaves, looking for lightning and wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the thread is not accurate, her body has been integrated into the dense forest, and the movement is only the sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is wonderful, she feels that she is still more comfortable than the birds - at least the birds will fall to the ground without flapping their wings, but she will not . As long as she maintains this form, she can rush to the end of the forest from the end of the fusion forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the scope of the leaf’s control now is nothing more than a glimpse of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the evolution of her abilities, she has set her sights on the hidden forest in the west of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can bring this vast forest into control, whether it is against evil beasts or collecting materials, you can help Roland to do a lot. She can return to her where there are not many places. In addition to improving crops, this is the only thing she can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a true forest compared to the back garden of the castle, and its complexity is far beyond the ecosystem of olive trees and vines. There are many living creatures hidden in every inch of land. If you look down the roots of the plant, you can feel the dormant animals, the creeping reptiles, the dead bodies, and the tiny water flowing from the raft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid losing her mind, she carefully expanded her own territory, starting from the west line wall, blending a little every day, and then adding a piece of woodland after fully adapting . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this rate, after two or three years, she can cover her consciousness to the entire forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the leaves found two people hunting in the woods - if not flying against the treetops, but walking in the snow, She can feel their position faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I found a prey," said the leaf shaking the branch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," Lightning first trembled, then patted his chest. "You scared me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Mai Hao nodded again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," the leaves let their figure emerge from the trunk, like the same new branch, "Would it be better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, at least not in conversation with the ghost," Lightning fell lightly on the ground. "Can you appear anywhere in the forest?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as it is the area I control," she nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheat stalks fell straight on the back of the leaves, took two steps back and forth, and smashed at the junction of the body and the trunk. "You actually grew into the tree." Lie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves felt itchy on their backs and couldn’t help but laugh out. "This is my ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It feels a little weird."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also mean to say that others are strange, you can become a devil giant bird. "Lightning whitened the pigeons, then looked at the leaves, "Where is the prey?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow me," she turned her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is impossible to maintain the human form when moving, the leaves simply let the ground erect a vine to guide one person and one bird forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of prey is it?" Lightning asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A big wild boar, running from the depths of the forest," she replied. "Do you really want to do it yourself, I can use the vine directly It is tied up and thrown at the foot of the city wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the explorer is not just the result," the little girl said, "the process sometimes is more than the result." It's worth recalling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves couldn't help but raise their mouths. Before they even merged with the hidden forest, the two were already regulars here. The way they practice magic is to hunt in the forest, and all the prey they get are returned to the castle by Mai Mai. Half of the meat on the table today is provided by them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, there," said the leaf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a huge wild boar squatting by the stream, licking the cold stream. The fangs on the lips are thick and sharp, and the bristles on the body are almost as long as the fingers, which is very tricky. If the hunter encounters such a beast, he will generally shun the house, but for the witch, the other party is just a good meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am up," Lightning pulled out the dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without a gun?" The leaves are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's too challenging to be sexual." She touched her nose with confidence and rushed straight toward the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"加油咕!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl’s figure is like a golden light, in the blink of an eye From the rear, he rushed to the top of the wild boar, and then a rise, the target suddenly swayed his head, bursting with a screaming scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No hits? No... The leaves noticed that one eye of the wild boar has turned into a blood hole. It seems that lightning is intended to use its flexible mobility, first eliminate the enemy's counter-attack threat, and then use the war of attrition to dry up the vitality of the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the air superiority of lightning, the wild boar is as clumsy as a stone, and soon after, it loses its resistance and falls into the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whistled, "How?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job," leaves Control the vines to entangle the hind legs of the wild boar and hang it up. "First put the blood on it, and your high-pitched meat is better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Mai said, swallowing. I can have a good meal tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait..." The leaves suddenly felt that another creature had broken into the forest, and she turned her attention to the control area. On the edge, I saw two gray wolves approaching here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something is wrong, she frowned. This kind of beast is generally active in the depths of the forest. Even in winter, it rarely ran so close to Bianbu Town. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is hesitant to tell the news to the lightning, and suddenly a familiar figure appeared in front of her eyes - the leaves felt the hair of the whole body stood up, the wild land The tragic battle of the encounter returned to her mind in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw two burly devils slowly moving towards the wall, with no magic stones on their arms and no spears on their backs. It was like not carrying weapons, but the leaves noticed that they all wore a black iron glove - that is the weapon that killed them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the devil coming here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She with great fear and uneasiness, converging her consciousness back to the lightning, "Get out of here, the devil is coming!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The two were slightly stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves will see the scene briefly after saying it, urging, "Come on, they don't have mounts, can't catch up with you two, I will follow Come over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, after hesitating for a moment, Lightning shook his head. "I want to stay and fight with them."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"War... fight?" The leaves are stunned. "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you run away with an enemy, How can we overcome them in the future?” The little girl took a deep breath and pulled out her pistol from her waist. “Dad said, where did you fall from, where did you get up? I won’t run away again.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
