			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yongdong Kingdom, Xueyingbao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults, Earl's Adults...The Grey Fort Army, retreat!" When a pro-governant stormed into the castle hall and announced the latest news All the nobles focused on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can be sure?" Earl Marvey asked the armrests of the seat and slammed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's true, more than one spy says so," the guard nodded quickly. "Someone saw their camp empty overnight and discarded it." A lot of rations!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This group of people finally...get out!" The count couldn't help but laugh, and the mood was suddenly a loose one. A month ago, the Grey Fortress suddenly appeared in the four harbour cities of Yongdong, and expanded at an extremely fast speed. They did not compromise, neither accepting surrender nor accepting tributes, almost sweeping away the population where they went. This plague-like barbaric act is even more terrible than the church – at least the latter can communicate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the Grey Fortress is also extremely ridiculous, saying that the Red Moon will bring disaster and must leave as soon as possible before this. joke! This land is the legacy left by his grandfather's grandfather. No one can easily take it away. The church is like this, as is the gray castle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults observe," an old-fashioned bachelor’s bachelor complimented. "The so-called full moon, moon, and moon are just a kind of sky, every other segment. Time will appear on a regular basis. They are willing to believe that this is a bad omen is their business. As long as the adults do not move in this place, they will have nothing to do with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, the cliffs around Xueyingbao are your greatest cost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the Grey Fortress is willing to negotiate, we will not be able to give in." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The church is also imposing at the beginning, and is it still not a bishop?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other People have echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confidence of Count Marvin was more and more calm, and he looked at the strange sky above the window, and he had no initial fear in his heart, and even gave birth to a glimpse of it. situation. If it wasn't for the change three days ago, the Grey Fortress would push the striker to the mid-line of the Yongdong Kingdom in a more than a month, and Xueyingbao would inevitably be affected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I heard that the barbarians seldom actively attack the nobility cities, as long as they do not interfere with their actions, they will ignore them and plunder the population. It is equal to infringing on the property of the nobility, and there is no reason to listen to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other party really swept the city around, did you not suffer when you arrived at the evil month? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the vassals said, the city itself is his greatest asset - it is located in the north of the capital, in one In the middle of the wall. The surrounding area is deeply deep, forming a natural “onshore island”. The widest part of the crack is as many as a few miles, and the narrowest part is also ten feet. It can only be passed by the rope bridge. The area in the center of the fissure is extremely large enough to accommodate the next few cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancestor is looking at the easy to defend and difficult to attack, only to build the lord castle on the "island". The facts also prove this point - Xueyingbao has never been compromised since its completion. Although the Hermes Church swept through the whole winter in a very short period of time, it was frustrated when it tried to attack Xueyingbao. The sending messenger negotiated with him, claiming that he could continue to take charge of the place as long as he loyal to the church. In the eyes of the Earl, this is the practice of normal people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with this that he has remained silent and wants to get a good price from the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions for Wimbledon’s promotion are simply unacceptable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Marvin is not worried that the Grey Fortress and the devil in their mouth have scored here, there is nothing more reliable than the cliffs. But the city also needs the replenishment of the surrounding towns. Even if the snow-covered castle is full of warehouses full of materials, it can support the day when the enemy gives up, but once the population is completely taken away, the resources that are spent can no longer be recovered. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, they were scared by the Red Moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hehehe, of course, is taking the initiative." The latter touched the long beard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl’s face suddenly became stiff, and it’s two different things to defend the snow and to find the other person’s troubles. Without this natural danger, he would not dare to borrow ten courage. Competing with the king of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t be afraid, I’m not talking about the Grey Fort, but the territories that have been looted by them. Think about it, the spy’s report mentions The enemy is scattered and scattered. A team is only a hundred people up and down. What can someone take away?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien’s eyes lit up, "You mean ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old scholar smiled and nodded. "The person who was taken away will surely leave a lot of things. We follow the route of the Grey Fortress. In the past, there should be a leak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it is extremely inconvenient to carry...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;; Ma Weien more and more excited, he recruited his chief knight, is preparing to issue orders, another guard suddenly rushed into the hall, "big, adults ... outside the city, came a devil... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What devil?" The count yelled at him uncomfortably. "Do you even believe in the ghosts of the Grey Fortress?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "About, forgiveness...Adult, but it..." The guardian voice whispered, "But it is really not human!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Not... human? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone can't help but face each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien’s heart also leaps, but as a lord, he must behave in a very calm manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In this case, take me to see it," the count uneasily, deliberately squinting, "I want to see, live in What is the guy in hell?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, wait for him When you walked up the city wall, you have already replaced the best quality armor and the biggest stone of the gods. Ten famous guards screamed back and forth, and the thick shield set up a "shield wall" around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the other side was seen, Count Ma Weien couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. This time, there was no mistake. The so-called "devil" did have only one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It stands not at the narrowest point of the crack, nor is it the weak point of the wall, but simply stands on a raised rock pillar, height Probably slightly higher than the wall, and a little further forward, it is the bottom of the ice. The patrolling knight has commanded the squatting from the trampoline, and the stringed arrow on the string points directly to the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful scrutiny for a moment, Ma Weien found that the other person really does not look like a human being, although it also has hands and feet, the figure is much taller than the average person, and the skin is azure You can also see a series of raised meridians and blood vessels. The most obvious difference is the length of the tentacles that grow on the cheeks, jaws and elbows - the nausea-like squirrels slowly squirm, looking straight and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes him puzzled is that the devil is closing his eyes at this moment, as if he is asleep, completely unafraid of the threat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monster is really attracted by the Red Moon? No... That’s just the saying that the Grey Fortress used to intimidate the ignorant villagers. The Earl thought that no matter how it came, it wouldn’t hang on to the end of the rumor. Instead, he just ordered the hand to pull the mast, this guy would The arrow was shot through the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Ma Weien took a deep breath and shouted, "Listen, ugly and dirty monster! I am the lord of Snow Yingbao, Ma Weien. Suo! You have invaded my territory. If you want to survive, your surrender to me is your only choice, otherwise the ice of this foot is your place of burial!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not think that the other person can understand what he said, and this righteous statement is not so much a warning to the devil, but rather to show a lord to the men on the wall. Brave and fearless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Grey Fortress thinks this is the hell demon, if he can scare off or kill one, it will inevitably increase his reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
