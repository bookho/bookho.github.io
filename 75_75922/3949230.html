			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the fire of the fireplace, Barry’s table is also set with a redwood lamp holder, the top of the table is divided into four branches, the middle branch is the highest, the other three Surrounded by a triangle. There is a candle burning on each branch, and the quiet light is like a winding mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is filled with the smell of pine oil, like a sweet, moist, dead wood, making people sleepy. But in Bianbu Town, he couldn't ask for more. Exquisite and elegant had nothing to do with this poor place. It was a good room to shelter from the wind and rain, not to mention that he now has a large group of houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where he works is in a large courtyard not far from the castle, and is also the seat of the city hall built by the former lord. Of course, when leaving, the lord took away all Manpower, here is now the site of the assistant minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of rustling from the room and the chilling wind outside the window constitute two different worlds. In front of a wooden table full of books and old scrolls, Barov is writing a book. He also has a long log table on both sides of the tree, which is usually used by no one, and is only used to place manuscripts. When necessary, he will call a disciple, lie at the low table, organize materials for himself or write a draft of the instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candle on the lamp holder has been changed three times. In addition to getting up and replacing them, Barov has not stopped the pen in his hand for a moment. Time is extremely valuable to him. There is still a stack of instruments on hand waiting for him to handle, and the financial expenses proposed by His Royal Highness also need to be carefully reviewed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bahrov now works five hours a day on average, but he doesn’t feel tired at all. On the contrary, he can let go of his work here, and he can’t finish it. The strength. This is the taste of rights. He thinks that he doesn't have to follow the mentor's buttocks. All the apprentices are obeying themselves. No one dares to drag their legs or squat. As long as the order of His Royal Highness is completed, the specific governance process can be grasped by oneself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the prince’s order was more normal, it would be perfect, and Barov snorted slightly with regret. For example, this is an instrument with Roland's personal seal, which says that it is required to send personnel to Liu Yezhen to recruit managers and buy a double-decked sailboat. The second article also specifically notes that the captain, the helmsman and the sailor may not be needed in consideration of the price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed and laughed after reading it. Without these people, who brought you back from the boat? Let them go back after buying? Moreover, what is the ship used to do? This is the most crucial point. The trade between Bianbu Town and Liuye Town is very stable. Even if the trade of ore is to be expanded after the end of winter, it is only necessary to inform the side to increase the number of ships. It is not cost-effective to buy a ship by yourself, not to mention that the town pier can only be used for docking, there is no dock maintenance, and there is no sailor to take care of it. It will not be long before it will be abandoned. Probably the whimsy of His Royal Highness has happened again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the first article, he can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the City Hall has no free time from top to bottom. The more than 10 people brought by Barov are responsible for supervising trade, doing statistical reports and revenue and expenditure settlement. I have taken administrative and legal work myself – which is obviously unreasonable. If His Royal Highness wants to separate these departments, it is necessary to expand the employment of the City Hall. For very normal reasons, the assistant minister did not want to let go so soon. The satisfaction of giving all the rights to one person is too fulfilling. He thinks that even his own teacher, the kingdom finance minister, is only responsible for the money bag of the gray fort, and he is the hand of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cough, well, only effective in Bianbu Town, he added in his heart. Although His Royal Highness Roland has promised so much, there is still a long way to go to get to the throne. Barov found that he did not know when he had reintegrated the four princes into the ranks of the king contenders. In the past, he wouldn’t think that this dude, who is a bad character and who doesn’t learn anything, can be crowned as king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since coming to Bianbu Town, his surprise has not been broken. So far, Bianque Town is still under the guard of the militia, standing in the west, and it seems to be able to persist for a long time. This is worthy of praise. In addition, I don't mention the rare things that he drums, even the grasp of the human heart, it is not like the four princes in the gray castle, it is like a devil who knows everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door knocked loudly outside the door, and Barov reluctantly stopped the action at hand, raising his voice, "come in." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s one of his proud disciples, “Pen” Yarrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
