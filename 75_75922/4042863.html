			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Joel did not know what was going on outside, it would not be a good thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that “black money” is an exhibition organized by the most powerful local businessmen. Except that the auction items are not legal, is there any difference from the regular exhibition? He cursed Otto a thousand times in his heart. First, the auction price was expected to be wrong. Now someone is looking for it. As long as he knows this, he will not agree to anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu’s look around and want to find something to defend himself, but in addition to some tools to torture the slaves, there is no one that can be used as a weapon. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door of the inner room was pushed open and a figure flashed in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joy did not hesitate to fall to the ground, "Fear! You want me to give you..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the person did not stop at all, and jumped to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To finish, he subconsciously tilted his head to one side, hoping to avoid the other side's attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Anne!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amy shouted at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the voice of the witch, the cold wind that had swept to the cheek suddenly stopped, and about to look at it, it was a wooden stick. It looks like it has fallen from the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is being done, I am afraid that it will be lighter and unconscious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he was grabbed by a big hand, raised his life, and pressed his back against the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He didn't do anything to you?" The sound sounded a little hoarse, and it was difficult to distinguish between men and women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said...he came to save me from leaving here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You again Was cheated, Amy," the man shook his head and twisted his hands to the back. He skillfully tied a strong one. "Five four thousand gold dragons to save a strange witch? This is not a small money, even if you The father needs a lifetime of accumulation, so that it is possible to get together so many golden dragons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诶...Yes, is that?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auction price is so clear, the other party is really the guy who bids with him? However, in addition to the booth position in the cave, the rest of the booth was dark and dull. How did the guy recognize him and follow the room to the 76th? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just knows that his time of life and death is here, and his lobbying is no longer for old friends or damn Otto, but to save himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't lie to her! I am the ash ambassador, and the rescue of the witch is the king's order!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Gray Castle... Ambassador?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this method works well when I hold his hand behind his hand and tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Roland. Wimbledon, have you heard that? The four sons of Wimbledon III, the king of the Grey Fort, are especially friendly to the witch! He I firmly believe that witches are no different from ordinary people, and even fight with the church to make the witch live freely on his territory! These are true, I swear!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The person may not know who Roland is, but the news that the church and the Grey Fortress fought in the cold wind and suffered a fiasco is indeed a well-known thing in Huiguang City. He even knows that these news are all from Hill. Fox and his helper put it out. The church has always been the number one enemy of the witch, who can defeat the church. For whatever reason, ten ** will win the witch's goodwill and respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the back of the hand suddenly relaxed a lot, then he was turned over and pulled up from the bed - this time I saw the attack on myself What does the person look like? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
