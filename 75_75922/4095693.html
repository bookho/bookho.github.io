			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George counted silently, the other party was a total of ten people, and there was no higher than the normal room of the royal family - six of them were obviously guards, wearing short activities The robe and leather pants, after entering the hall, were scattered and occupied several corners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not surprising that there are female guards under the lord’s hands. There are two in his house. They don’t expect them to be powerful, but to improve their taste. Especially when hunting in the wild - whenever you get rid of the leather that is more tempting than protective, the moment you press the other in the mud, always makes him interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s strange to bring them to such a formal occasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women have an insurmountable gap with men in strength, which is determined by birth, so those outstanding guards and knights are basically male. No one will be with the vases when they are looking for fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the looks of these people look so simple... hard to look straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not George is picky, but a little bit of a bar in Chishui City, will not put such a woman into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facial features are ugly, and even the skin is extremely rough, and the age seems to be thirty or forty years old, and the wrinkles and dark spots left by the wind and the sun are almost From the forehead has been spreading down the chin. Although the body has been well-balanced after a long period of exercise, as long as they see their face, they will lose all interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does Roland Wimbledon love this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when he turned his gaze to the woman holding the new king, he immediately vetoed his own guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a young woman who is impeccable from any angle, and its blue eyes are like a gemstone, and when it’s eye contact, it’s amazing. It is difficult to remove his sight. He has no doubt that it is the most beautiful pair he has ever seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearance of this person caused a brief silence in the hall, even if the North Pearl Isis Kant did not have such an effect. If she and the new king are too close, I am afraid that most of the nobles have already swarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two were veiled and didn’t seem to want others to know what they were. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of dressing is not uncomfortable, but it is very rare at the banquet. If you don’t want to see it, you can choose not to attend, so it’s so attire. Instead, it is more noticeable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like a cup?" Gay came over with two glasses of wine at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," he took the glass and followed the other side to the corner of the hall. "What's new?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woman next to Roland...somewhat strange," Earl of Three Rivers whispered. "Do you not think that she is too talented?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also noticed?" George touched the stone of the god of punishment on his chest, and he said quietly, "I guess... she is probably a witch."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think so, if it is a woman in a big family, it is impossible to hear a little bit of wind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland It’s not a secret to swear the witches. From Wangdu to Chishui, similar news has been circulated. At the beginning, it was only the mice who were spreading. Later, when the king was changed and the church was removed, the news became more and more intense. It was no different from the straightforward propaganda. Things like persecution of the witch have gradually subsided, and no one wants to annoy the new king because of this, but few nobles take the word "recruitment" seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their view, the role of the witch is the same as that of the female bodyguard, usually placed around to watch, and can be enjoyed when needed - after all, the appearance of the witch is obvious to all Even when the church and Tiffco were rigorously searched, there were people who couldn’t help but take risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to understand just bringing the witch to the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a victory all the way to let the new king have no worries, let the temper in the private life, or he really took the woman as...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
