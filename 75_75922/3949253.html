			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The production of artillery is also progressing steadily, the second artillery has entered the expansion phase, and the third artillery is still in the hoarding material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are lucky, after a month, he will have a gorgeous lineup of four 12-pound guns. The advantages of firepower are unquestionable, but how to turn the advantage into a winning position is a question that Roland has been considering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was just a mechanical dog before crossing, and like most people, the understanding of war comes from history, movies and games. If it is a thorough cold weapon war, he will let go of Carter and the iron axe to command. But this battle is not the same, no one can understand the way the hot weapons are fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, he can only combine all the knowledge he has learned, and use the eyes of this era to make every step of the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure victory, Roland let lightning go to and from the fortress every day between the fortress and the border town, one is to observe the road surface, and the other is to accurately calculate the distance. Roland believes that the victory of war is based on a large number of investigations and calculations. Whether it is tactical development or the deduction of the battle, these two points are inseparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made several one-meter irons and one hundred meters of hemp ropes with the size set in the last cast, and then on the west side of Bianbu Town The artillery test field, based on the hemp rope and wooden pole projection, draws a flight track about one kilometer long. Lightning exercises control the magical consumption and repeatedly travel through this distance at a fixed speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she mastered the magic output, Roland began to measure the distance from the fortress to the town. Taking advantage of the round-trip time spent in the sundial, he calculated that the distance between the two places was about fifty-four kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is only a straight line distance. In fact, the road has to turn two big bends to avoid the foothills where the desolate mountains extend. In any case, if the Duke chooses to march from the land, it will take at least three days to reach the border town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lightning as a scout, Roland can clearly understand where the enemy is and what action to take. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the west of the town, within two kilometers of the town, he has been filled with signals for marking the distance, as long as the enemy enters this range, the artillery team can Shoot the table and quickly adjust the corresponding muzzle angle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he is starting to worry a little, what if the other party is not here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the door was ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale that had been lying on the couch and chewing the dried fish piece disappeared instantly. Roland coughed twice and said, "Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is opened by the Assistant Minister Barov. "His Royal Highness, a nobleman with a long song fortress wants to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Who?" Roland didn't respond at the moment. "They sent the ambassador again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, not an ambassador," Barov shook his head. "It was the Baron Ferris who left before the demon moon, and now he is back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought for a moment and remembered that there was indeed a The fortress nobles lived. But are they still dare to come back? And just ran over in the spring, is it that I have not seen the iron fist of the royal family? "He wants to see what I do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the city wall defense is hampered, his house was demolished," the assistant minister said. "If you don't want to meet, I can help you to get rid of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland wanted to agree, but changed his mind and changed his mind, "Let the baron wait for me in the living room."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be some pressure on the long song fortress through him, the prince thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, Roland came slowly to the living room, on the side of the long table, a man with a round belly had already waited a little impatient. He walked back and forth, and the flesh on his face trembled with the pace. Seeing the appearance of His Royal Highness, the Baron stopped and made a reluctance to bend down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
