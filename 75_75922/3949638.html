			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with a year ago, the castle’s night banquet belongs to the witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves will expand several times and the backyard becomes an open-air camp surrounded by olive trees. Around the burning campfire, everyone looks up and can see the night sky. Awkward stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a lot more fun than the last time there were only five witches participating in the barbecue. Not only did the supportive witches arrive in full, but also added McMug, Lucia, Aisha, Speer, White Paper and Axia, plus seven people from the Sleeping Island, the total number reached 25. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A plate of cut food and sauce is placed on a small table next to the campfire for everyone to use - after cleaning up the territory of the rebel nobles The meat and cloth in the warehouse have also grown a lot. In addition, Evelyn's special low-alcohol wines, as well as the ice cream provided by Ai Gesha, are also on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lightning is still enthusiastically demonstrating how to cook a chicken leg for the first time to participate in the barbecue, the wheat bran has already sizzled the steak Stuffed into my mouth - following the little girl who had been mingling between the mountains and the jungle for a year, she was very handy about any food that could be grilled, and the pockets in her waist were the same as the former, stuffed with various styles. Various seasonings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think it’s a waste of time," Aegusa put on the ripe beef balls in her hand and put on honey. "The devil is about to strike, don't hurry and prepare for the battle." , oh oh... instead enjoy a short victory here, until the enemy breaks through the city... oh, everything is finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slowly, it doesn't matter, Roland handed a new bunch of Baoxin Niu Wan to her and saw that she liked this kind of meatball with soup. "Work and rest are more efficient. It is not in this day to defeat the devil." Leisure, and even if you fail, you have at least enjoyed the good life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fallacies!" Ai Gesha gave him a look and took the meatballs. After rolling a circle in the oil bowl, it was placed in a bonfire. With the help of the frost ability, no matter how the fire is baked, she can keep the surface of the meatball at a proper temperature. It can be seen that the cooling and nitrogen production work of this time has made her more control over the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, Axia, who has joined the league, has apparently never seen so many meats. Although his saliva is still lingering, he is hesitant, but he is warm. Tidy noticed her restraint, pulled the newly awakened sister to her side, and shared her baked food with her and white paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash, Andrea and Sawyer of Sleeping Island are waiting for food barbecue, and by the way, playing poker - just a few months In the meantime, the three of them learned all the games that Roland knew well. As long as the evil beast did not attack the town, Roland always saw them in the castle hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And several other sleepy island witches, such as Candlelight, Evelyn, and Sylvie, have been very acquainted with the town witches, seeing them with leaves The echo, the echo of Soroya and others are very happy, just no different from the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the warm scene in front of him, Roland is very pleased - after more than a year of hard work, the change of the West is just a little surface, whether it is the daytime plaza The enthusiasm of the people, or the smiles on the faces of the witches, are the rewards of his efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This return is so sweet that people can’t help but get drunk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bonfire is extinguished, time goes to midnight. Roland let the nightingale and the ashes respectively escorted Nana Va and Axia to go home, and they came to the second floor of the castle, waiting for Anna to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to take the initiative out of this step instead of waiting passively, or delaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver-white moonlight shines into the castle from the window between the corridors. With this light, he sees Anna’s blue eyes – this scene is familiar. But the position of the two was reversed. The pupil hidden in the darkness reflects a faint luster, like the stars in the night, but there is no embellishment of the stars. At this time, the night sky belongs to her alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not speak, but took her hand up and walked to the third floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
