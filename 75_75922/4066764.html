			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of people crept into the building and climbed the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a burning charcoal in the aisle. The scattered books and paper can be seen everywhere, probably left by the students who have been evacuated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking for the smell of coke, everyone quickly found the location of the incident - a classroom near the end of the walkway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When inside, Lily noticed that the corner of the room had become dark, the wall was cracked, and the crack continued to the floor. The area of ​​fire is not large, and it can be seen that the range of fire changes is very obvious. The dark wood is deep to shallow, and the circle is spread like ripples. It is not caused by natural arson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what most cares about her is the cracks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are almost like the ones that are pulled out with an axe. The gap is completely carbonized, and the fingers are stretched in, and you can feel the faint residual temperature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be right here," the mystery month turned around the corner, "Axia, then handed it to you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...if someone comes, you remember to interrupt me," Axia walked to the center of the classroom and showed her ability to trace back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the explosion time was determined, and the distance was not more than one day now, she quickly found the key node before the incident - as the magic emerged, the broken The walls have become as good as ever, and the seats in the east have been restored. There are a lot of students in the empty classroom. Some of them are sleeping on the table, some are gathering together, there is no teacher on the stage, it should be a noon break. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I saw this scene, Maggie and Vanilla couldn’t help but sigh, and then I was afraid of disturbing Axia, and quickly caught my mouth. . In particular, when I saw a "student" coming to them as if nothing had happened, but they passed through their bodies like a ghost, the two jumped a few steps in a panic and almost fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, these are illusions," Evelyn explained enthusiastically. "Axia can trace back time and make things happen again. Now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... is a great ability!" Amy was also the first time she saw it, but she did not show any fear, but Said with a look of admiration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha...not much more," Axia was embarrassed to touch her head. "Compared to the night sister, my ability is not at all What.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Night? You mean the big blonde sister who often follows her, who rarely shows up?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, she is the most powerful witch in the whole West, maybe even in the whole kingdom!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Awesome!" Amy's eyes sparkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait," Mystery Month suddenly interrupted their words, "Look!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lily frowned. "This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bullying?" Evelyn whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw five or sixty-year-old children encircling two girls in the corner, arguing fiercely, and the two people in the encirclement reacted differently. A flat hand stretched out in front of everyone, shouting loudly without retreating, and the other shook his head behind the former, and it seemed to be scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the primary class has no uniform age, the largest of these groups seems to be fifteen or six years old, and the body is more than two girls. They must be tall and have an overwhelming advantage in the posture. But the short-haired girl who did not let her instigated was not intimidated by the people of the other party. Even if there was only one person, the momentum did not fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the mouths of both sides, it can be inferred that the content of the dispute is related to their place of birth... for example, going back to the east, rebeling the dog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dispute quickly evolved into a shoving. The tall man took the lead and tried to push the blocker to the ground, but his hands just caught her. On the shoulders, he was kicked in the knees, and the whole person slanted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
