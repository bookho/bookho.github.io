			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the night, Roland took the crowd back to Liu Liting—the block where the book first entered the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same old-fashioned street as the package community, but it is more commercial than the former. There are many convenient department stores, fly museums, mass-market KTVs and Internet cafes on both sides of the street. The scale is not large. The main force of patronage is basically the nearby office workers and students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it seems that the environment is a bit dirty, but it is suitable for the book to hide identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrance and exit of the docking point is just beside the street. There is no difference between the outside and the ordinary iron gate. As for this door, it is here, or the book is in a dream. After the emergence, Roland is still unknown. However, this position is obviously extremely important. He is already considering whether to acquire the shops on both sides through the relationship between the association and the Sanye Group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the subject area of ​​the book can only carry a god-destroying witch action, and it will still be dangerous if it is targeted by many demonists. As a key person to pass on the knowledge, it is obvious that there is no risk at all. If there are ten fighting witches standing around the docking point, the security will undoubtedly be higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sparse flow of people, Roland made the final round of tests on the interaction between the two areas of consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dream world stops running, no matter where the book is, it will be excluded from the dream and returned to the small archives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the biggest difference from the god witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter's consciousness will return to his body, but the position in the dream world will be fixed at the moment of leaving. This is why Roland asked them to get in and out as much as possible in the Rose Cafe or the next-door warehouse. Otherwise, when the staff changes, there may be a scene where someone disappears out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the book is obviously more serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least in an emergency, the sorcerer and the witch can keep up with Roland to achieve a "seamless connection", and the book cannot do this. This also means that every time she enters a dream, she must start from the archives and end up in the archives when she dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, considering that as long as the church book uses a mobile phone, you can always ensure that both sides are in the right position before waking up, plus Falun’s magic flying insects Surveillance of this area, so it is not a difficult thing to solve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rule is also true in turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the book is actively detached from its own field of consciousness, the gods and the sorcerer in the field will be forcibly discharged, the former returning to the reality of the body, while the latter Appeared at the entrance of the iron gate. That feeling is not good, it is like sitting a roller coaster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is quite unexpected for Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the ideology, the iron gate still exists, but behind it is neither the wall nor the narrow gray room, but a red void. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the symbol of erosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Garcia, erosion cracks are not something that can be seen everywhere, and where they exist, there is usually an association commissioner to mark. In other words, this erosion should be the right thing that the archives bring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the relationship between consciousness is not simply a relationship of containment and accommodation. Roland realizes that they are all part of the consciousness world and occupy the magical The power of the source is probably the most appropriate interpretation. This is also consistent with the statement of 岚 - as long as the dream world devours more cores, he has the opportunity to invade the field of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question arises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other high-level devil's field of consciousness enters his key beam range, how will the dream world change? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Roland received the latest news from the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two pieces of letterhead stacked in the envelope, one written by Wendy, which briefly tells the current situation of the witches, the second half Part of it highlights Nana Va. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little girl who followed the Witch Alliance finally ushered in her adult day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like Lucia, Mystery, etc., the magic of her adult moment has also condensed, according to the division of the Federation, she is considered one A veritable high-ranking witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific ability content letter did not make any explanation, maybe everyone is too busy, or the magic of Nana Wa is precious, so it is not allowed to spend on testing. ... But Roland doesn't care too much about this time. For him, the most important thing is that Nana Wa has crossed this threshold without any fuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other letter is much thicker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are both the report of the First Army and the plan submitted by the Staff Department - this is also a major drawback of the existing messaging channels, in order to save transportation Resources, the front line will often wait until the need to report to a certain extent, will be delivered back to the winter city. Therefore, it is clearly the same letter, and some contents may vary by several days or half a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the end, Roland’s brow suddenly wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" asked the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil launched a full-scale attack on the first position." He sighed, "- just a week ago!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf heart, wind whistling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screaming voice once again resounded over the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third time since sunrise today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn monsters, don't they know how tired?" 裘 狠狠 啐 狠狠 狠狠 狠狠 狠狠 狠狠 狠狠 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 啐 狠狠 狠狠 狠狠 狠狠 狠狠 狠狠 狠狠 狠狠 狠狠 狠狠I couldn't pour anything for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give." A hand suddenly came out from the side. "Are you looking for this?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heda turned his head and found that the speaker was the law, and what she handed over was a white pill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... don't need this?" He hesitated to pick up the pill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not as vulnerable as you are, but it is only one or two days without sleeping," Fayue replied blankly. "And I hate these things, Who knows what it is made of! I advise you to eat less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe you are right," Throw the medicine into your mouth, "but it will at least keep me alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the medicine is opened on the tongue, a bitter taste is very fast Filling up the mouth, at the same time, the bitterness of the air, the dizziness of tiredness and exhaustion seem to be swept away, and even with stiff fingers and limbs become flexible. He felt that he had returned to the keen hunter again, instead of being a prey that was exhausted and waiting to be slaughtered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s this feeling--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;裘达起起枪枪, 稳定稳定了. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These drugs were distributed to each soldier as a distribution item half a month ago. Its official name is called a retarder, but everyone prefers to call it Do not pour the pill. As long as you take one, you can completely shield your body's suffering until it breaks out in a few hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some sand people initially resisted this drug and linked it to the legendary madness pill, it didn’t take long It disappeared. The reason is that the First Army did not force the use of retardants, and also marked the characteristics of its sequelae on the wrapped paper bags, requiring that it should not be taken continuously - this practice is contrary to the rumors of the three kings heard by Trent. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
