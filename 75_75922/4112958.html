			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland closed the book and took a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large arrival of the Worried Island Witch will undoubtedly infuse the industrial manufacturing of the Winter City with incalculable vitality, but... there are also several difficult problems at present. before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest point is the issue of compensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They belong to the Sleeping Curse, and in principle are led by Tilly, and the willingness to accept employment depends on personal wishes. Although Tilly’s attitude towards him has changed a lot, let him take back his previous promise and use the other’s relationship to drive the witch. Roland feels that he can’t say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the job planning on the book is just his own plan, how much can be achieved, and how many girls and witches are willing to devote themselves to the sleeping charm. Come to the wave of production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slogans such as "the most glorious work of labor" and "labor changes fate" have little effect, and the saying "for home" is even more It doesn't make much sense. For them, the place that can be called home is probably only a place to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland believes that as long as you live for a few years, anyone will fall in love with the city and treat it as a self, but not now - for newcomers In fact, it is normal to subconsciously create alert and concern about strange places. He can't wait until a few years later to develop industry, so he still has to pay to talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, there must be desire to drive them to work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had previously asked Tilly that the witches offered for the fjord merchants or explorers when they were sleeping on the island, the price was quite expensive, mostly They are between tens to hundreds of golden dragons. Although the money was used by Tily for the purchase of basic living materials, the witches still used the original quota allocation, and the days were very poor, but this does not mean that they have not seen the money. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, now that the Golden Dragon earned by the Chaos Beverage Trade has 30% of the money, it is foreseeable to come up with a small part to improve the living standards of the companions. In other words, even if the witch does not work, she will not starve to death, and even live much better than on the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So just relying on a few Golden Dragons may not work. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not afraid of low pay, I am afraid of comparison - the salary of the Witch Alliance is mostly between one to three Golden Dragons, why should it be higher for outsiders? Even if the latter's salary rises, it is easy to attract criticism: it hasn't changed much in the past two years, and the sleeping island witch has risen up. Is it necessary for the elderly to be treated by newcomers? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the league members don’t say that, Roland is not willing to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but look at the nightingale on the lounge chair and looking through the comic strip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably felt his sight, the nightingale turned slightly sideways, "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A perfect curve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, now is not the time to think about this, Roland cleared his throat, "How long have you been here?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two years and eleven months plus twenty-six days," the nightingale sat up straight, "What do you ask this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So accurate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember giving you two gold dragons a month, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ah, at that time," she said with a hint of unclear smile. "Yes, it is twice as much as Anna, and I refused. Later, you repeatedly pleaded, I just made it difficult for you to answer your guard." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which pleading, it is obvious that you see Anna spend the adult days safely, go back and want to discourage Hakala, then completely fall out before deciding to stay. Okay! Roland turned his eyes and said, "Have you ever felt that your efforts and gains were not proportional to each other and considered leaving?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
