			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week, Bianbu Town ushered in the last month of the fall in a heavy snowfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked out of the office window, and the black silhouette shook on the white roof - this is the job that the townspeople must do every day, the roof Snow shoveled to the ground, so as not to crush the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, he has been in the world for just one year, but the fall of the previous year is far less cold, and you can’t see it from here. So many neat and intensive houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town at that time said that it was a deserted area that was about to be abandoned. It was not surprising that there was a circle of wooden houses that looked like a decent outside the square. It was all the broken mud houses and thatched houses. Most of the noble residences are concentrated in the square. The only stone road leads from there to the castle. In addition, the whole town can no longer see a flat ground, and there are people and animal excrement left everywhere. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roads here are all replaced with water-stable roads - even if there is no cover, it is a hard road with excellent quality, and the dark lines will be silvery white. The town is divided into many squares of different sizes. The spacious main road is on both sides of the planned commercial area in the future, and the outer part is the residential area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the industry in Bianbu Town has gradually taken shape, or finally, from workshop-style production to a self-circulating production line - of course , only for steam engines. The blast furnace area can produce iron ingots that meet the processing requirements, while the steam plant can process them into parts. The blacksmiths are no strangers to all kinds of machine tools, and at the same time bring a large number of apprentices. Although the highly accurate steam machine tools rely on Anna to manufacture, it is a very rare progress for them. After all, before this, the people only touched the blacksmith hammer, or simply the miners and hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it as a worker who relies on his own strength to produce it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the production of bullets and gunpowder, all are handled by ordinary people. Guns still need Anna's hands, but the reason is not the lack of processing machine tools, but because the town's blast furnace can not produce quality steel, this point has been listed in the next stage of Roland's urgent problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievements in the chemical industry are much more surprising, probably because they didn’t have much hope, so any result is an unexpected surprise. Now that sulfuric acid and nitric acid have started mass production, chemical explosives have also been eye-catching. As long as the production of bullets can be raised, it is not difficult to replace the new generation of bursting guns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't matter if the production method is backward. For the current situation of the town, it is more important to solve the problem. When the ability of the white paper is stabilized and the magic power can be precisely controlled, the industry will be able to usher in a new peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most crucial thing is that no matter which production, or education and construction, Bianbu Town now tends to a benign development stage. As long as there is enough time, the number of educated people is increasing, and breakthroughs in various fields will become faster and faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a year to turn a barren land into what it is today, he has a sense of accomplishment from the bottom of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in the town by the window, Roland feels like watching the whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the melodious bells came from the northwest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a warning of a beast attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the arrival of the demon moon, about three to four days, the alarm will sound once. However, the first army has dealt with this situation. It is a practice to make it happen. It is no longer necessary for Roland to go to the wall to supervise the war. I thought that if I did not appear in the militia's field of vision a year ago, it would be difficult for them to leave their weapons and flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The evil beast is coming again, let me see?" The sound of the nightingale came from the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Roland nodded, "pay attention to safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, they touched Not me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he felt a slight heat on his cheeks and his voice disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
