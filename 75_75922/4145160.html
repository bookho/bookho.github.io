			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing it, Roland feels a little surprised and takes it for granted. "You - who is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A trapped person in search of help." I hit the next four weeks. "I know that you have a lot of words to ask me, we can sit down and talk slowly, just choose the seat next to the window." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't go to Room 302?" He stared at the other side and sat down on the seat near the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The place is to avoid the eyes and ears. Since there are no other people here, it is natural to sit anywhere." He said casually, "Yes, since it is coffee." Can you have a cup of ice for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that the secret talk was a shocking secret, which made people nervous and leaked. "There is a great disaster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The value of the secret depends on the person who hears it. Not to mention staying in the ground all day, but also to guard against the expansion of erosion, the nerves are enough It’s tense. It’s hard to come out, it’s natural to relax.” Slowly and replied, “A cup of ice, thank you.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stares at her for a moment I didn’t have a good air. "I only have instant food here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hell, obviously on his own site, but it seems to be dominated by her anti-customer... He poured the brewed coffee liquid and milk into the cup, plus two ice , Ended in front of the other. Throughout the process, his eyes did not leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, I won't disappear out of thin air," he shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can be said," Roland’s eyes groaned. "I used to contact you, and I have been to Prism City twice, but At that time, you just disappeared completely. Since you left a note, why not talk to me directly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, 岚 silence for a long time is low Sighed, "Because the time has not yet arrived, the child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time... Not yet? Roland paused. "What do you mean, let me discover that the Red Moon... is actually erosion. Is it more credible than telling me to take this initiative?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Your reaction is very fast, which makes me look forward to you a little more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to help you?" Roland couldn't help but scorn One, "Your look may not be like a person who needs help urgently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of performance do you think will make you believe?" Urgently begging? Holding your thighs and crying? Or is it a lot of rewards?" He shook his head. "No, even if I did, you wouldn't believe it easily - that It will make things worse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t know how to know the result, Roland wanted to go back half-joking, but then swallowed it. The other party is not a peer of the same age as Garcia. She is the chief disciple of the martial arts association, the master of Garcia, the predecessor of her predecessors. If the time stamps seen in the reflection church are counted, then her age is probably seven or eight hundred years old. Looking at the characters who seem to have come out of history, he finds that he can't help but converge a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well..." Roland sat down across the street and roughly combed the countless questions in his head. "Have you been a member of the federation?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have nothing to do with your world." 岚 replied, "I was born here, and I will sleep here, although this is an extreme The long process is gone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I saw your portrait in the reflection church-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It’s not surprising that there are similarities in appearance," she interrupted. "Not to mention the record that has been preserved in history, and there is not much value for reference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a bit too clever." Roland frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She may not know it, or she may deliberately conceal it, but Roland knows that without the help of the nightingale, it is impossible to judge the authenticity in a few sentences with the level of his observation. Since the other party answers this way, it doesn't make sense to entangle it. It is better to ask more questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So...what is the magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking up, "You should It has been faintly guessed - it is nothing. The existing system cannot explain it because it does not belong to this world, just as low-dimensional creatures cannot understand high-dimensional structures. The only thing we know now is that we can Use it, so you can also describe it in a common word: the power that you get by chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough...just like the power of nature. Roland thought, no, no... It’s not accurate, it’s not the same as the power of nature, but they are all the same thing. In order to explain to yourself what magic is from another angle, the dream world will become like this. "The lectures you made at the Welcome Conference in Prism City... and the speculations in the book "The Reasons for Being" are all... really?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; One is the origin and essence of erosion, and the other is the inference of the constant reincarnation of the battle of God. These two are the problems he most wants to clarify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Inaccurate, but you can think so." The answer was unexpectedly refreshing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to know the exact statement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is beyond your understanding, You can't express it accurately with your writing system." She drank her coffee. "In addition, all my actions are under the supervision of "God". Once the disclosure reveals information that may harm it, both worlds will be destroy. So keep in mind that only the things you personally realize are the real answer. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can't help but smack the mouth. This is not the same as saying it straight down. I am lying for you.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does it have the power to destroy the world? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I used the gods to refer to it. After all, this is the image that is most likely to have this ability in your consciousness. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the purpose of the gods? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Let the battle of divineity continue. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the relationship between you and the gods?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time I didn't answer immediately, but hesitated. "I am the one who betrayed it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Back...Rebel? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this kind of reincarnation will never end, I don't want to be trapped in this place." And reincarnation means loss, and one day, the gods will collapse, and by that time, no matter which world, it will become dead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at her for a while, "Then you are looking for me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I need your help, child," he did not avoid his eyes. "I need you to stop the battle of God and make it completely shut down." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean winning the war? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, that's just a new round of reincarnation," he shook his head. "If you want to stop it, you must replace the gods!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn't help but hold this answer... It's really sensational.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sucked Tone, "Sorry, please forgive me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? "I don't understand, the expression on my face has some changes that are different from before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You told me that I can't verify it at all. Moreover, even you yourself admit that you can only use ambiguous answers in order to avoid the surveillance of the gods. Sometimes misleading often only requires one word, which means that I may be cheated by you, and still help you count the money - after all, you claim to betray the gods, is it easier to betray me? Roland spread his hand. "It is not something I am good at taking in the fire. Therefore, instead of the great cause of the gods, you should find someone else." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
