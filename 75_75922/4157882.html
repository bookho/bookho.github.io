			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you entering the conscious world here?" Hecksod looked around the hill for a week, and finally his eyes fell on his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nod in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think the male will come again." It quietly opened a door with a finger-sized twist, and then reached into it - It is mud. "Not to mention the God of God can not be reversed once it begins to fall. You are wasting your time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want to come, you can go first." Not for the move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I am leaving, who will take you away?" Heckzod silently rolled his eyes, and you all openly turned to the fake face, now say these Really not deliberately mad at yourself? When Wang read this memory, he was guaranteed to see the ubiquitous figure of the Scorpio Lord. He violated the king's life, informed, and taught... This pile of crimes can be thought of with closed eyes. If Wang really sends other Maharaja to deal with it, there is a top-level silence of the fighting, and he can still have more self-protection ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next 100 meters is still mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if I can leave. And...you can't do it, it doesn't mean Wakiris."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啧, don’t even think about it, find the way who Wakiris came up with. "If it can't think of it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Silence did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the 500-meter, the side of the twisted door suddenly turned into a hollow, Heckzod fine-tuned the direction, and the finger quickly touched a thick The effusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a bottom in mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever thought about forcing the male to leave with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silent His eyes flashed, but he quickly recovered his calmness. "It may be possible to take it away, but it is very difficult to keep him alive. You and I know how vulnerable humans are, without determining Wakiris. I can't take this risk before the position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Heikezod can't help. In any case, it can't let the other person stay here, and then the god made by God will become a powder. This is for the sake of the race and for itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone is coming." Silence looks ahead, "more than one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heck Zod opened the door of twisting for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, three males appeared on the slopes of the forest, and the soldiers responsible for the letters were also there - although more than when they first met, but People are still unable to pose enough threats to the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty agreed to your meeting request." The leader walked up to them and opened the door to see the mountain. "After a quarter of an hour, you can enter the consciousness circle. But your majesty There is a condition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the request of Cerroshhi, it seems that the king of mankind is not all coward. "What conditions?" Heckzod asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must separate a distance and enter the conscious world. And the non-devil must wear this -" the other opened the portable box and took an iron from it. Quality bracelet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stone inscribed on the bracelet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzed was suddenly furious, it narrowed his eyes and his voice was dangerous. "What does this mean? It’s hard that you feel that I will bind my hands. Let humans slaughter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the soldier, although with fear, can not step back, "magic is equivalent to weapons, unloading weapons during major meetings It’s just a convention. It’s not a kind of imprisonment. Your Majesty believes that you come with important information, so you will risk the return, and because of this, he does not want any accidents.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What if I disagree?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it, we don't have time to delay." The silence is looking at Heckzod. "You can wait in the capacity, just like the first time. I don't understand why you must come with me." Come here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy...I have to say it myself to understand! The Lord of Scorpio is a word, but it is not that it has a significant decline in the level of reason after seeing the nightmare. If you don’t follow it, you can’t worry about it. After hearing so much shocking news, you can see Wakiris with your own eyes. Excluding the trap that is not deliberately set by humans is undoubtedly a very necessary thing. Which side is this guy standing on? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not waiting for Hecksoddo to discuss a few words, Cerroshhi has come to the side to close his eyes and enter the state of meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the god of God who is still rising after the eye, it has no choice but to suppress the dissatisfaction and buckle the bracelet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing does not seem to be difficult to disassemble with violence, probably humans did not expect to capture themselves with the stone, just to delay the time, to avoid it suddenly silent Just underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two males who followed the soldiers...they did not carry weapons, but Heckzod faintly gave birth to a bad feeling. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a while, Cerroshhi’s breathing suddenly fell silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come on...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod is pretending to look up inadvertently, Put the colorful magic stone disguised as a ring in front of you-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, a beam of light like a city wall is presented in front of it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range of the light column is so large that it has to turn around to bring its boundaries into the eye. So for a moment, it even thought that he was back on the island of bottomless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...the area of ​​consciousness that is as broad as the city in the silence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It began to believe in human aspects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such amazing ability, there may be a way to unlock the secret of the war of divineity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod took a deep breath and then slowly closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are like this, the mask started the second program in advance. Since it is ready, I am currently not sure if it is still alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Scorpio reopened his eyes and found himself in a narrow In the house - in terms of the king's standard, this room is far from enough. Silence seems to be explaining the current situation, and sitting across from it is exactly what Wajilis has not seen for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this re-emerging nightmare monarch, Heckzod has a feeling of being like a world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are finally here." Wakiris nodded. "Sit down, the coffee is getting cold."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After experiencing so many incredible events, you can start in such a relaxed tone, it really looks like its style...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Western Front has been fighting since the beginning of the war. The three monarchs finally gathered together for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ethnic group, this is also a major event worthy of careful treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that doesn't fit is the man sitting next to the nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has already heard the other person’s name from the silence - the king of the gray castle, Roland. He is also the biggest cause of repeated setbacks in the West Line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they can be brought together because the other side can be realized, which makes Heckzod's mind quite complicated. It’s really ironic that it’s not the lack of this or the lack of the battle. It’s ironic to carry the face of the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
