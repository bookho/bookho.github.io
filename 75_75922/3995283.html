			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the weather is clear and the sun is shining, it is a good day for punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately half an hour, there will be a cannon in the direction of the square, which means that a big man who was originally "pretty" got his due Trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime has been confirmed before this, the process is more to publicize to the public, especially the church and Tiffco collude and murder the king, usurp the throne That set. After nearly a week of finishing and preparation, the evidence chain that was exhibited was complete and arguable - of course, Roland would not give them the opportunity to debate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, there are not many aristocrats who have been hanged, except for Tefco and his men, the former Prime Minister and the legal officer, the rest are churches. Believers. Now the Wangdu Church has been uprooted, and all the people who participated in the plague incident have not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the group of scums were pushed onto the gallows, they would be warmly welcomed by the onlookers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really go to the scene to see?" The nightingale stood by the window and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Axe and Taza will do all this," Roland answered without raising his head. The public trial held in Bianbu Town is to stimulate the will of the masses and improve the centripetal force of the people, but there is no environment for implementation here. People will not stand on their own side because of the head of the pseudo-Wing Fei Keke, just as they did not immediately vote for the pseudo-king after the death of Wimbledon III and Goron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not have enough mass base here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional safety is also a big problem. The list of gems in memory was eventually found by Sylvie, and Tefco hid it in the dark of the bedroom closet. In the hustle and bustle, Roland found that the remaining gems were 12 fewer than the number on the list, and four of them were hidden in the kingdom, which meant that they all received orders from Tefko. Although not necessarily the assassination designation, you must be careful. The place where the execution ground is mixed is not suitable for going onlookers - and he is not interested in the execution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has more important things to deal with than this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the casualty of Wang Duo finally got a detailed statistics. The first army had a total of thirty-three sacrifices. This is the most serious loss after the army. once. Although they have defeated several times their enemies, they still expose many problems in the street fighting. The most important thing is that the demolition of the house is not enough. Most of these casualties are madly guarded from the houses on both sides of the street. Caused by the killing into the queue. If you can equip some guns, grenades or blasting drums, and remove the suspicious houses while pushing, the casualties will definitely drop a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the number of soldiers, a 3,000-strong first army can now sweep the entire gray castle, but want to do the next place to occupy a It was quite stretched. After the capture of the king, at least 500 people must be left to maintain order. In addition to the next fall and the south, the size of the army is obviously not enough to deal with the security war... Further expansion is imperative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland wrote down the pension and expansion plan and handed it over to the guard outside the study, ordering him to return to the city without the order, and the town hall would complete the next all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the prince then turned his attention to the group of the small nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t have the strength to make a political call, but everyone can count on contemporary intellectuals and are eager to get a chance to advance – Wang’s original big The ministers of the votes were all cleaned up. They were either deported or sent to the winterless mining area to serve their sentences. Now they have vacated a large number of positions. Wanting to keep the king still working, let them work for themselves is the best way to save manpower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barov has been in the king for many years, there must be many acquaintances in it, and it is much more effective for him to organize a temporary management institution than to force himself to choose. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the responsibility of the small aristocrats who are determined to rely on themselves can also increase their enthusiasm. Joel is the role model chosen by Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These days, he finally considered the place where the "old friend" was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
