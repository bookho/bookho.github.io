			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland on the fourth day brought the fortress and the aristocrats near the fortress to the castle hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although most people know the news, he feels that he still needs to emphasize it in person - the West has changed a new owner. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he affirmed that he would return to Bianbu Town and handed the fortress to the eldest son of the honeysuckle family, everyone suddenly talked about it. Of course, no one is willing to take the lead to stand up and express dissent at this time. The Duke’s head is still hanging high in the gate of the city, and the news of the defeat of Tefco has made it impossible for speculators to use external forces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the redemption of the Knights of the Honeysuckle family, the other captive knights will not accept the ransom, and with those mercenaries, will be escorted back to Bianbu Town. In Roland's plan, the mercenaries were sent to mine for labor reform, and the Cavaliers took discretion after examining their repentance attitudes. After all, most knights were literate and could be used as enlightenment teachers for universal education. Of course, they are not allowed to use weapons in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the power of the honeysuckle family will stabilize the four people, the use of force in the hands to defend the long song fortress and their own count is also basically enough, Roland I think, as for the undercurrent flowing under the water, it is the thing that Pei Luo should go to worry about. In the past few days, he also took time to send out his guards and arrested a group of officials who caused the death of the residents of Bianque Town two years ago, including financial Minister Fereno, they will accept the people's trial in Bianbu Town. The only regret is that the attempt to burn the grain and grass, the chief culprit of the dead grey dog, Earl M. Mead, died directly on the battlefield without trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the traffic between the Long Song Fortress and Bianbu Town has been fully restored. In the coming week, there will be more than a dozen sailboats every day, and the resources will be continuously transported. Bianbu Town. Roland speculated that Barov would definitely be busy in the next step. He received the money plundered from the Duke, and resettled a large number of immigrants. He did not know that the temporary wooden shed built by 嘱tok was well done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but want to return to Bianbu Town as soon as possible to host the upcoming farming industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entertaining the size of the nobility used lunch, Roland was planning to go to a nap, the castle ushered in a special guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Priest of the Long Song Fortress Church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suddenly has no sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike Bianbu Town, the church has been rooted here for a long time. Not only did the church be built, but a high priest was also stationed there. This is also the main reason why the prince decided to go back to the town to develop peace of mind. Under the long-term indoctrination and influence of the church, any civilian may become their eyeliner, the plan that they want to participate in the public will be controlled everywhere, and the witches are The risk of discovery has also multiplied. Unless the church is uprooted, his reforms will only be difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the lord of the fortress to replace this kind of thing, the church’s close attention is a very normal performance, and Roland is strange, they can bear to send representatives to deal with themselves today. However, the identity of the comer is not simple. The believer who served as the high priest is already a high-level figure of the church. He is responsible for supervising one party, and the territory under his jurisdiction is similar to the secular duke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He received the other party in the lobby as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyro High Priest is a middle-aged man, dressed in a church-style white-brown robes, aged about 40 years old, dressed and neatly dressed. Talk and behave like a courteous aristocrat. If it is not the ass sitting on the side of the witch and the royal family, I am afraid that anyone who talks with such a person will be happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest must have a high-quality stone of punishment. In order to avoid accidents, Roland deliberately stayed up late from the other side before the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Taylor’s salute, Roland invited him to take a seat and ordered the attendant to deliver the tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter what you think, the surface is still in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I am sending blessings on behalf of the Holy City," said Tyro with a smile. "You have become a veritable king of the West. God bless you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
