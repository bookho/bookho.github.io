			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn dawn on the slopes, watching the busy but well-organized positions, the ups and downs of the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time he has been on the battlefield... At the age of fifteen, he has been a good knight, following the lord’s charge, and after adulthood, It was the reputation of the first knight in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is no longer unfamiliar to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here, he feels a completely different atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristocrats were sipping, rewarding, and eating and drinking before the war, so that the morale of the team can be improved, so the free people and mercenary camps are often immersed in one piece. In the chaos of the carnival, in addition to no wine, the scene is no different from the open market. Everyway, the knights will always laugh at the group of people who are stupid, and a few pieces of cheese bread can make them forget, but they don't know that these things are their lives. At that time, Film. Sirte also took it for granted that only the nobles knew how to fight. It is a beach of scattered sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the Duke of Ryan was defeated by a group of miners in Bianbu Town, he discovered that the facts were somewhat different from what he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only at that time that he realized the vengeful wish that he did not continue to go deeper, but instead put all his energy on his wife, Irene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two years, because of his father’s conversation, he decided to join the staff of the dawn, but found that the war has completely changed into another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the discipline of the First Army in the trek of the past month has already surprised him, then the professionalism of the soldiers at this moment is sufficient The majority of the nobility is ashamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need for any agitation, everyone is familiar with their tasks: several trenches are excavated at the bottom of the slope, and the topsoil is packed into the bag. In the machine gun position, a simple low wall was piled up. In the middle of the trench is also interspersed with barbed wire and temporarily processed wooden refusal horses. The difficulty of frontal breakthrough is almost no less than the capture of a main city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the line of defense, there are also multiple buffer zones. Even if the machine gun position is broken, it does not mean that the battle is over. The Takira witch will protect the barrier of the artillery battalion. It is also a reserve force that can support the front line at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last side of the slope is the core of the first army's attack - the six-door fortress is elevated and pointing straight to the direction of the devil's outpost. The artillery are correcting the firing parameters and making final preparations for the upcoming offense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to command a command at all. In just one day, the First Army transformed this place into a qualified battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill has seen the power of the new type of firearm in the artillery drill, but it is always the foreign object - the operator of the weapon, and ultimately it will fall on the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these soldiers made up of free people are the ones that most sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a disciplined, well-defined team, even the Knights formed by the great aristocracy is difficult to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the changes in the folks can be detected when there is no winter city, it is nothing compared to the impact of this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now do you know?" Xiao Xiaochen suddenly heard a familiar voice behind him, "The answer to the previous question."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill went back and nodded to Sir Sirte, "Yes, father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you announce In order to unify the gray fort in just a few months, and at the same time into the Hermes and the morning kingdom, the staff not only did not raise strong opposition, but instead developed a seemingly inconceivable plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of such weapons and such warriors, no one on the mainland is his opponent, or... other hostile forces are simply not worth it. One mention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
