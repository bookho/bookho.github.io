			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is where you last landed?" asked Tilly as she looked at the towering rock face in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful woman sailed west along the shore after seeing the coastline, until the meteor met, the ashes shouted to stop the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, look," she pointed to the top of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly looked in the direction she pointed, only to see the orange flags on both sides fluttering in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the beach was still here last time, the two flags indicate that we have not taken the wrong path."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "I also have the impression," said Old Jack, holding a pipe. "But last time they carried a huge balloon to transport all the witches over the cliff. How do you go over?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The huge balloon?" Tilly was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s full of heat, you can fly," Ashes nodded. "It is said to be the invention of His Royal Highness Roland. The principle is to use the power of hot air to rise and put the balloon. "Take the day with people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of the five kings is a bit complicated, "The court tutor has not taught these things." Then she spit out the breath, "anyway I will see him soon, and I will know the result naturally. We will go ashore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure you are not waiting for him to pick you up on board?" Falling ash, "What about the cliff?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give it to the Sawyer," Tilly smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is a naturally formed coast, no one knows the depth of the seabed, the beauty is not too close, only by releasing the landing boat The way to send people to the shoal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After stepping on the thick snow, Tilly looked at Jack. One-eyed, "Mr. Captain, so trouble you wait here for three or four days, lotus them You still need to help send it back to the sleeping island."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," the captain said, "I don't dare to return on the boat without you, I know." Those mutated water ghosts will not come to the door again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly walked to the edge of the cliff and used the ability of the magic stone to fly directly to the top of the mountain and observe the surrounding Situation - The terrain behind the mountain is much higher than the shoal, almost the same as the top of the mountain, which means that it only needs to climb and does not need to land. The height of the wall is about 50 steps, and the magic consumption will increase greatly when the barrier is used to push objects. However, such a distance should be no difficulty for Sawyer. She slowly landed next to the four people. "Yewei, the three of them will bother you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Tilly," the latter smiled Pat the chest and then summon the invisible barrier - after two days of rest, she has recovered from the violent collision against the behemoths, and when everyone puts on a transparent barrier, she drives the magic to slow it up. Rising up, I turned over the hill in a short while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, under the guidance of the ashes, the group took half a day to finally arrive at Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that comes into the eyes of Tilly is a unique steel bridge. It sits across a wide river, with only two piers at the bottom, removing a neatly arranged iron beam and iron column, without any extra decorations and patterns on the body. The snow covered on the bridge surface is in sharp contrast with the exposed black bridge. At first glance, there is an indescribable momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This bridge...is really big," sighed with the wind. "How many iron ingots did they melt in order to create such a bridge?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a waste of material. It’s clear that a pontoon can solve the traffic problem. Is it necessary to build such a high?” Ashes didn’t take it for granted. “Bianzi Town itself is the last of the merchant fleet. At one stop, is there a ship that wants to go to the birthplace of the river to do business?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seeing shallow speech," Andrea swayed his index finger gracefully. "Even if I am not a gray castle, I can see that the woodland in the west is quite valuable. Now there is no town that does not mean that there is no future. If you want to continue to expand the territory, it is a good choice to expand to the no man's land. At that time, the pontoon became a roadblock that hindered the transportation of rivers. The older brother of Tilly was obviously longer than you thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
