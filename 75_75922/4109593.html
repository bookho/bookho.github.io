			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goal is confirmed, the attacker is the devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are coming!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In both directions, there are also devils in the 12 o'clock position!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watchmen of each team In turn, the target is observed with the naked eye and the gazebo, and the sound of the alarm is one after another. The fish balls were distributed according to the shooting area and they were closely attached to the second group of enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil at this time is like a leaf in the wind. Only when flapping its wings can it be determined that it is not an ordinary bird. According to the training process, he puts the target into the shooting circle and starts to adjust the heading indicator on the sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new sighting device that stands on top of the machine gun looks very weird. It has two juxtaposed rings, one of which has a beast The model can be rotated around. In the other ring, there are several small round holes that are juxtaposed. As long as the model is moved, the hole will also rotate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the fish ball knows nothing about the working principle of the sight, he knows that this is something that Roland has designed, as long as it is related to the armpit, the inevitable effect extraordinary. So he spent one night remembering every step required before the shot – and the first step was to set the heading indicator, the model of the beast, to a position parallel to the direction of the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the enemy recombines with the small round holes in the shooting circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he swept his eyes and shouted to the teammates on the side, "A quarter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The ratio of the area of ​​the target to the model is four to one. This password means that the devil has entered the effective range of Mark One. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Stars, who assisted in the training, repeatedly emphasized that such visual results are not accurate and can only estimate the distance of the enemy, so Let the bullet cover the enemy's forward line, and you can report it to Dalit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this fish ball is clear, it can always be played early, but it is a waste of bullets when it is late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After completing this step, all he has to do is wait for his teammates to report the results and then pull the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s clear that this series of actions has passed the countdown time, but he is like a long process of tempering, and the surrounding voices are getting farther and farther away from him. For a moment, he even seemed to hear his own heartbeat and breathing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slight wet touch in his hand tells him that the timid fish ball has not left him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this has strengthened his determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil is still close to the wall at a fixed speed, and slowly raises the height, seems to want to reapply the trick five days ago. The distance between the two is at least eight or nine hundred meters away. Almost the head-to-head terror body is like a thin piece of paper. Even the sharpshooters of the precision shooting group may not be able to hit this group. Enemies in flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they are different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bachelor said that he did not understand a lot of principles, but one fish ball remembered very clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the enemy is approaching the distance of the spear, you can shoot directly at each other, but before that, you are not slamming the enemy, but on the other side. Spread enough bullets on the way forward, and then wait for them to hit yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the fifth hole!" Just at this time, came behind him The shouting of the same group of teammates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish pill takes a deep breath, lifts the muzzle, "embeds" the madman that you are aiming into the hole in the 5th hole, and then uses the maximum force buckle Pull the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The muzzle suddenly spewed a raging flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harsh gunshots caused the time to flow again and again, almost at the same time, several other teams also fired together, and the entire wall suddenly boiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark's muzzle is not aimed at the devil, but is aimed at an obvious blank area. No one knows if he can hit the target. The only thing that all machine gunners can do is hold a 忐忑And expect, hold the trigger and pour out the bullets in the bullet box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After almost a break, the group of devils at 12 o'clock suddenly burst into a striking "red flower"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the safflower blooming, there are half pieces of wings and splashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beast that was hit by the bullet tumbling violently, as if it had changed from a thin piece of paper to a wrinkled rag, until then, the fish ball can be roughly See what the other person looks like. From the scattered objects, he did not find the traces of the madman. Obviously the first enemy to be shot down was only the transporter carrying a bunch of red fog tanks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two more beasts that have deviated from the route, falling like stones on the ground - from the outside, the light can't tell if they are urgent. They either shunned or suffered heavy losses, but they did not fly again until they broke into the grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, the inspiring soldiers broke out with loud cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One more! Dude, doing beautiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High shot, see you "!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adding the effort to kill the mess!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Long live the majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil seems to be aware of the inadequacies. The neat and orderly queues are scattered, but they have no intention of retreating. Instead, they have no intention of retreating. Accelerate to the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three-quarters!" Fish balls hold the gun tightly and adjust the direction of the shot. "No... four-quarters!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As large as the model, it means that the enemy also has the power to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free fire!" the screamer shouted, "Everyone, free to fire!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The comrades who held the wheel rifle also joined the shooting ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots on the wall suddenly slammed into a ball, and although the twelve beasts had been shot down by a third, the enemy made an obvious evasive response. After that, the hit rate began to drop sharply. At this moment, the fish ball found a beast that slipped out of an arc and swooped straight from him into the sky - in the roar of the deformed monster, he faintly saw that the madman on his back had lifted With a bone spear, the spear seems to be facing himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold chill came up from the soles of his feet, fearing that his hands couldn’t help but tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's figure becomes bigger than the model, he no longer has to estimate the distance. For the Mark type, this range is almost equivalent to a straight line. As long as he raises his muzzle and aims at the other party, he can make it a horse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the same, the bone spear will penetrate his body mercilessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape, or die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiar feeling is like a shadow, as if the cowardly fish ball has caught his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh —————!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time the barrel spurted the fireworks of death against the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet that went out rushed to the devil, tore its muscles, smash its bones, and finally rolled through it...the huge impact The enemy's body was inextricably swelled, and the flying pellets smashed its viscera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the moment of being hit, the madman also threw the bone spear in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
