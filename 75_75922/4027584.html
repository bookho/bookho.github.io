			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come on? What is coming? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has not asked the sound, the earth under his feet suddenly arched upwards, and then it was torn apart, and the entire Blackrock Tasha was lifted up! I saw a gray behemoth rushing out of the ground, opening a large bloody mouth, trying to completely wrap the bottom of the stone tower, and the mucus splash on the skin was everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Axia’s ability can only look back and not reproduce the sound, Roland is like watching a silent movie, but the extremely realistic scene still makes him I felt a strong shock. As for the witches who watched for the first time, it was not so good. Everyone screamed and slammed their mouths backwards. The ash and even the reflexive swords were blocked in Tilly. before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are more than one frightening monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a tentacles monster under the Blackrock Spire. Its dark body is almost completely embedded in the tower body, which looks like the countless feet that grow at the bottom of the stone tower. Only the dark red light reflected by the scales indicates that it is a living thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the tentacles is almost half the size of the castle, but it is still insignificant in front of the giant beast that is enough to swallow the tower. In order not to be swallowed into the stomach, it waved a tentacle between the upper and lower jaws of the behemoth, and at the same time spewed bloody fog from the scales, and the traces of corrosion were clearly visible from the giant beast. - Obviously this rich to nearly black mist can cause damage to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, compared to its huge body shape, blood fog corrosion alone can not stop the swallowing of the giant beast, and as the stone tower is lifted a little, the tentacles are finally Unable to support it again, it was crushed by the huge weight of the tower body and fell into the monster's belly. Then the Blackrock Tower slowly slipped down until it was completely devoid of giant mouth. At the end of the image, Roland saw the demon covered with eyeballs. It seemed to be indifferent to the monsters in the raid camp, squatting on the top of the tower, and was also swallowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to this end, in an instant, the red fog and the behemoth disappeared, and the scene returned to calm, leaving only a huge deep pit, telling everyone The scene just now is not an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland grew a sigh of relief, and he firmly believed that it was right not to call the First Army soldiers on the crowd, even that he felt the heart when he watched the accident. Jumping, even after the end, there is still a lingering lingering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...the worm that engulfed Miss Aisha’s lab?" After a long time Tilly broke the silence, "Why would it be against the devil?" Camp underground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe we all thought wrong before, it may not be a mixed kind of evil beast enslaved by the devil, at least not controlled by the devil behind the snowy mountain ......"Roland looked at Ai Gesha, "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also agree with this view," Ai Gesha nodded, apparently on this issue. I have been thinking for a long time. "Don't say that there are no records of this evil beast during the two wars of God. If the devils really have the ability to drive them, we can't hold on for so long. As long as the enemy is attacking the city, it will be dispatched. The high-order devil's gorilla enters the city from the ground, and Takira has long since become a ruin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is not the devil, then who is Control it?” Tilly frowned. “There are also a group of transparent enamels discovered by Miss Nightingale, obviously these The beast's behavior is planned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can't do it because they want to do that," said the night slap, "mixed species is not The general evil beasts, in terms of the performance of the evil moon, they already have basic thinking ability. As long as they live long enough, they may be smarter than us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; This sentence makes everyone laugh and laugh, the atmosphere of the dignified scene suddenly dissipated a lot, obviously no one really think so, after all, a group of rubbing blood, the monsters arched in the mud will be more than baking bread, wearing The human beings are more intelligent, and this kind of thing is too ridiculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Roland did not speak, he looked at the bottom of the deep, the thoughts in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human being the smartest species? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t even think about it, especially in this completely strange world. When the living environment and living needs are different, the characteristics exhibited by the intelligent creatures may be completely different. Take the evil beasts, they certainly won't think that silk and bread are good things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
