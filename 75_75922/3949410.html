			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the summer is about to end, Bianbu Town is about to usher in the last and hottest month of the summer, and Roland is more and more unwilling to leave the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saltpeter purchased from Margaret, except for the manufacture of gunpowder, is used by him to lower the room temperature - now in almost every room, They all have a bucket of saltpeter, and there is a kettle in the bucket. This can not only play the role of heat absorption and cooling, but also drink ice to hydrolyze thirst. Only in this way, he would not be sitting in the office every day, it was full of sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Anna, the other witches were also stopped by him. In addition to the daily practice and study, they basically gathered in the first floor hall, or Gossip, or each other than the Kunte brand, a happy look. And Anna... It’s not that Roland doesn’t want her to rest, but she is not afraid of heat at all. The red iron ingots can be held directly in the hands, and the hot summer heat is nothing to her. Even if she was busy at the steelmaking furnace for an afternoon, she would not have a little sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reward the hardworking and serious Anna, Roland has recently made some ice snacks to treat her, such as the classic delicious ice cream of the later generations - with egg yolk, cream, milk and sugar water After mixing and stirring evenly, it is cooled by saltpeter. Anna is very fond of this cold, soft and sweet snack. Every time I bite the ice cream and the blue eyes are bent into a seam, it will make him feel good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, looking at the end of the month summary table sent by the City Hall is also a great pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bianzi Town So far, the population has doubled again, and it is close to 18,000. In addition, the long song fortress will "turn over" a group of serfs every month, and it will not be a problem to break through the 20,000 mark in the coming year. If you do not calculate the number of villages and towns in the territory, this scale can be compared with big cities like Chishuicheng, Jinsuicheng and Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly regrettable, the population has grown a lot and the quality has not improved much. The current education is still more than a thousand indigenous people in the town, and it may take a year or so to graduate. The private college that Carl started before has created a group of first-time graduates, but less than 100 people. The number is still insignificant relative to the total population. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe you should first educate the refugees in the East, instead of waiting for enough dormitory areas to do this again, Roland thinks, after all, education goes ahead Only benefits, no harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the factory in the town is also very good. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After half a year of construction, the industrial park now has three plants in operation: two steam engine production plants and one bullet processing plant. The number of workers in No. 1 factory has been expanded from the ten blacksmiths who were just founded to more than one hundred people. The follow-up is basically the aborigines - this is what he hopes to see, and a group of apprentices gradually grow into craftsmen. And then drive the next batch of apprentices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers in the second factory belong to the Chiyuewan Caravan. In just one month, they have mastered the use of each machine tool, even though the yield ratio is relatively high. Oops, but the blacksmiths of the No. 1 factory, the performance of these craftsmen in the first month is obviously better. It was only before the contract expired that the steam engines they produced were owned by Roland. Now the two factories can produce about eight to ten steam engines per month, which is also the main income of Bianyan Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the bullet factory, it was handed over directly to the First Army after completion. Not only the entrance has a sentry post, but also patrols are arranged around it. Even the production work is carried out by the soldiers. . After a one-week trial run, mass production of a new generation of fixed bullets has begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland designed the assembly line not to achieve full mechanical production, whether it is the base fire, gunpowder or warhead, it needs human loading and compaction. The main processing tools are two mechanical presses, one for pressing Anna's cut copper into a shell shape and one for stamping the bottom cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers only need to evenly place the mercury sulphate powder between two sheets of thin paper, stick the paper, sandwich the bottom fire cup, and finally put the bottom fire cup into In the annular groove at the end of the shell, you're done. As for the process of filling black powder and compacting the warhead, it is exactly the same as the previous dressing exercise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of factories is small, only forty people, almost every day can produce more than 500 bullets. Roland intends to turn these forty people into full-time processing personnel to maintain the normal operation of the bullet factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
