			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is still a little snow in the sky, it is a good weather for the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nails are bored and wipe the barrel of the hand, and occasionally look at the direction of the mountains with the lookout mirror - this frequency grows with the date of the station And constantly lowering, until now, he will only watch two or three times a day, the rest of the time is used to maintain the fire gun, and chat with his companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintenance weapons are a careful activity. Every half a month or so, they can get a "oil stick" that is the size of a thumb and wrapped in hard paper. I heard that the remaining waste oil was used from the soap factory. When you need it, you have to heat it and apply it to a special double-head brush. The latter is big and small, just inserted into the barrel and the nest. In the past, every class was equipped with cleaning tools. Nowadays, there are more and more factories and workshops in the winter city. The brushes have become the supporting items for the guns, almost one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if no bonfire is available, put it in your arms or in your mouth. Although the First Army explicitly banned the consumption of such waste oil, there are still soldiers who secretly smear a little bit when distributing dry food and eat it as a condiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a squad leader, he generally chooses to turn a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the teams responsible for staying in the North are basically veterans, and some are even older than him. If they did not participate in the primary education popularization class, this The squad leader couldn’t take him for a while. Looking at those neighbors neighbors, uncles and uncles, nails can only smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After assembling the disassembled parts in turn, the rifle becomes shiny again. He buckled a few times and confirmed that the airgun fired normally before he moved his sight back to the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fall of the squad in the fall until now the nails are unforgettable. When you close your eyes, the younger man in red robes will appear in his mind. woman. At that time he was in this bunker and witnessed her death. Even if he knew that the other party was an enemy and was a pure person of the church, his sight of struggling in the rain still made him feel uncomfortable. If it weren't for the command of the Axe and the effect of his majesty, he would have left the army and returned to his own position - a mining steam engine operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although still staying in the First Army today, the nail decided to move away from the machine gun group and turned into an observer to protect the machine gunner. Ming knows that his behavior is quite a bit of self-deception, but he has never been able to cross the level of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a bloody battle, the battlefield where the land was soaked with blood has not seen any clues at the moment, and the barbed wire has long been removed, leaving only ten The wooden piles of the roots of the east; the trenches are also filled with snow, and if not a few bunkers still stand, this field looks just like the surrounding earth. Apart from them, no one knows. Just a few hundred meters in front of the first row of wooden stakes, more than two thousand people were killed here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The squad leader, there is no firewood in the stove, I went to the ground to move some," said a soldier with a similar age to nails. He said that the firewood is The piles that were used to fix the barbed wire, "otherwise, the group that took over after the class would blame us for not using it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now is the duty time... "The nails shook their heads. "It was not good to be seen by others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They won’t say anything," another veteran laughed. "This day." If you are cold, who cares about us to move some things to warm up. It’s been a few months, and the church’s gangsters can’t even see the shadows, and they can’t find it at this time.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This statement has been unanimously echoed by everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail also knows that the other party is right. At the beginning, there are still 500 people left in the camp. According to the requirements of the iron axe, they will continue to be stationed at the foot of the cold wind mountain. In case of the dying of the church or the invasion of the evil beast. However, none of the envisioned enemies appeared. It is probably that the situation will not change again. The defenders have also withdrawn more than 200 people. The rest are only in the form of patrols. Stay in the bunker to monitor the movements in the northwest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated and finally agreed to the soldier’s application. "You are too slow to move alone. Let's call two more together." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter whistled, "Yes, head!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
