			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the night, the Earl of Elk was brightly lit, and the invitation with the invitation was held by the Earl’s family, Miss Aurelian. The birthday banquet just started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banquets are all aristocrats who have a family and fame in the Long Song Fortress. The Earl is also very valued for this celebration, from the lobby The full wool rug and the uniform custom-made black gold gilt dress can be seen. After all, Orillian is just sixteen years old and has reached the age of marriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strings are ringing, the waiters are carrying wine and wine glasses between the crowds, and the round tables in the hall are filled with steaming cooked food. The protagonist Aurelian is dressed like a canary, is being surrounded by a group of sisters in the corner of the hall, looks very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most popular banquet in Wangdu. Before the Western Festival banquet was not like this, Pei Luo thought, everyone usually sitting around a long wooden table, waiting for the chef to serve. All that comes up is a large bowl of pork and whole chicken, buttered bread, double-sided fried browned eggs, and large pots of lettuce leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Pei Luo, who has also been in the king for a few years, this celebration feast only mimics a shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the glasses in the hands of the attendants are all glass cups of different colors, not transparent and clean glasses. After pouring the wine, it is impossible to set off the mellow color of the wine itself. The round table should be covered with white cloth instead of exposing the greasy table. As for those cooked foods, they still maintain the traditional style of the West – big and thick. Peero shook his head, so I had to let the chef cut into small pieces and then come up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the usual practice, he had already filled his stomach at home before going to the banquet, and at this time he would not cut the large pieces of cooked meat. The invitees to the banquet all represented the faces of their respective families, and the mouthfuls of the food here were bright and shiny, which was really detrimental to the image. Pei Luo didn't want to be treated as a joke in the mouth of each lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long time no see, buddy," suddenly someone hooked his neck from behind. "I heard that you were appointed as the messenger by the Lord of the Lord? How about the ore harvest, you have gotten a lot from it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This familiar voice, knowing it is Rennes Mead, the elk family Zi, I want to be a famous knight, a fool who can't even care about the land. Of course, it is also a friend of mine. "Fortunately," Pei Luo did not want to talk about the experience in Bianbu Town. "Do you use it in the Windwind Ridge this time, or say, stay in Hermes? "There is a trembling in the pub?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn," Ryan pushed Pei, "I have never heard a good word in your mouth. This time. I didn't even go to the new holy city. The day before the border guards set off, I just got infected with the cold and lay down in bed for a week."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, than Last time I improved a bit, at least I saved the Guards a lot of trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time you are wrong," Ryan suddenly and mysteriously laughed, " If I didn't lie in the cold wind for a week, I am afraid I will always lie on the icy wall of the holy city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also listened to others," the second son of Elk approached his ear and whispered, "The new holy city almost fell, and the evil beasts rushed into the inner city." If it weren’t for the church to send out their strongest warriors, I’m afraid that even the Holy City Cathedral could not be saved. However, the army of the four kingdoms suffered heavy losses, and the Windwind Ridge did not return a few people. In just one month, the city was full. It’s a widow. I don’t have any savings at home...” He rubbed his eyes and stretched out two fingers. “Two silver wolves can. Hey, don’t look at me with this look, I can’t do anything. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure the news is true? What about the Border Guard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I saw it with my own eyes. The lord fell ill on the day of receiving the news." Ryan shrugged. "As for the Guard... what can I do, and slowly recruit again. Now the Northland is in short supply of experienced Warrior, if it is not home, I will call at least one cavalry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the point at all. Pei Luo thought to himself that the main defense of the border guards of the Cold Wind Ridge is the church trial army. Now the generals of the four kingdoms and the soldiers are buried in Hermes. A bit of a conspiracy. If they have a plot, the northern part of the Grey Fort is now like a woman who is lighted. "Just the judge, how are they lost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
