			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a silence in the conference hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has a face-to-face look and a very complex look, with the exception of Fiji. This also made Roland feel surprised in the dark, it seems that unconsciously, the other party has a considerable understanding of his origins and another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Shishi was cautiously opening the door, "Dream world... Does it mean that it can dissipate like a dream at any time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, this is just my customary name, because I can only enter the world when I fall asleep." Roland said calmly. "In the beginning, I thought it was as illusory as a dream. But everything that has been experienced here has changed my mind. You can also call my world a dream and use it as a reality. Even I believe that when the research on magic on both sides progresses to a certain extent, the connection between the two worlds Will reach a new level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His afterglow sees that the Fijian language has raised his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you don’t have to go on, everyone in the room can understand what he means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world's barriers will disappear from invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are free to travel between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's got to be done again." An old man frowned. "The problem now is that we don't have any means to verify what you call true and false. Everything is too ridiculous, I really can't believe it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Roland, I have no intention to blame you, but your understanding of this matter is basically from Who betrayed the gods, who knows what conspiracy is hidden behind them?” Soon there is a reconciliation. “The essence of the gods is the key point. It’s hard to let the other person conceal the whole cause of fear of being known by the gods. Convinced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the most critical thing not the power of the gods? A existence that can destroy the world, why not always do it? Maybe we act rashly, it is the cause The real cause of destruction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once someone has opened his head, the suspicion will spring up like a mushroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think this is a dead knot. According to God, if you stand by, the world will be devastated, and you can break into the realm of the gods, the result of defeat. It is still dying. Then the question is coming. Do you think that Mr. Roland has any chance to defeat the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether these statements are true or not? My opinion, why can't it be an excuse for the hunter to make up his position out of thin air and want to seek a higher status? Of course, the old school is not without suspicion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you talking about? Don't forget the one who supports you the most, but your new star!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venue that was discussed at the beginning gradually became a gunpowder, and Roland did not interject. Put the teacup on the back of the bench and watch the people argue with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this scene, he had long anticipated it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my heart, it is equally good to change himself to be told that such a reaction is not so good. The other side’s questioning is also all about the point. For example, the betrayal of God’s practice of merely giving clues without a positive answer has a certain degree of credibility, and what can he change after facing the gods, these questions are not to mention Roland. I can't answer now, even if it is really the moment, he probably won't know the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, he deliberately concealed the message of betrayal of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The association’s top executives will at least not spear the spearheads on the masters of Garcia when they argue with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the final result, he does not expect too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who has a strong will like Fiji Han, who will go all out once he makes a judgment, is a different kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already the biggest significance of this meeting to make the dream world realize that the crisis is approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a dazzling silver glow blooms from her fingertips-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Roland is too late to discourage, this light will have already smashed the table in front of it into two! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teacup that was split into two was dropped to the ground, giving a crisp broken sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, everyone’s eyes turned to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you forget, the original intention of the establishment of the martial arts association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her voice Not high, but the meaning of dissatisfaction is undoubted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For thousands of years, the awakened are gathered together to protect against the erosion and protect the world from being devoured by the demon! What is the truth now? ? More powerful enemies appeared in the erosion, Prism City was overturned in an instant, guarding the anger and death, and the awakened person could not compete with it. In the face of such a crisis, you are discussing another world here. Don't you feel funny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Fijian, don't forget your identity!" The old man was discolored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rock stopped his further blame and asked with amazement, "Is this not important?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Fiji did not hesitate. "I only saw one point - the martial arts can't beat the gods, but Roland can, then protect the world, can help people who can protect the world." Isn't it a matter of course! Please don't make a mistake. He explains the magic and the other world's things just to satisfy your curiosity, not to give you an excuse to question him!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, even if Roland is just an ordinary person, as long as he can kill the gods that the martial arts can't destroy, then the association should fully support him and put him in the same importance as protecting the world. The status of this is what is in line with the purpose of this Council - otherwise, how do we mean to call ourselves the guardian of this world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is difficult for the gods Being defeated, so we need the joint efforts of the two worlds. Abandoning the future with fear of the future is nothing but the practice of awkward people. Even if we end up failing, it is all done for it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe someone will I doubt that the argument that "the martial artist can't kill a god" is not true. I can understand this idea. After all, there was only me and Jieluo at the time. However, I also welcome everyone to verify - "When it comes to this, Fiji's body is covered by silver, and the tone is reduced by a few degrees. "As long as you can also hurt me to one degree in one-on-one contest. I will take back these words, how? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swept the audience, her eyes were as sharp as a knife, and those who were older or more senior than the genius of the martial arts, no one Pick up the words.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a new generation of singers..." The meteorite suddenly laughed, and he snarled, "I really shouldn’t The extra places are undecided, and forget what the association really cares about. You are right, no matter where Mr. Roland comes from, his contribution to the association is unquestionable – both as a model for newcomers and as a number of demon hunters, which have injected a strong boost into the rebuilding association. Heart needle. With this in mind, you should not presuppose your position and speculate on him with malicious ideas. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian looked at the two people, and the voice was quite emotional. "Since Prism City was captured, I once suspected that human beings could erode this catastrophe." It survives. The situation today may be more serious than I expected, but everyone has at least one goal that can be seen. As for the other world, we can explore it slowly after solving this crisis. What do you think? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This... is also the most appropriate response." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, or to defeat the enemy of erosion first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of approval gradually overwhelmed the doubts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, eliminating erosion is the martial arts It is imperative that if you want to overthrow this conclusion, you must first go through the Fiji language.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
