It’s not only that the facilities were built, but you also heard the signal. ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called iron tower project is the first step of the radio communication plan - in order to meet the huge antenna needed for long wave, the Ministry of Construction is in the North Hill A transceiver tower nearly 50 meters high was set up in the city of Silver City. More than half of the towers are only the size of an adult's body, so looking from a distance is like a sharp long needle. In addition to the retractable hydrogen balloon tow metal wire, the antenna length can reach more than 100 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of construction difficulty, it does not have much to be commended, but the communication tower is a system engineering, and the transceiver equipment located below the tower is Focus. Since the electromagnetic wave is inevitably emitted multiple times during the debugging process, even if it is a messy signal, it is normal to be captured by the other side in this world without any interference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly, Your Majesty." Barov replied excitedly. "It does have a wonderful reaction spontaneously like you said." Just... I don't know if it was caused by Silver City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think this question will be answered soon." Roland indulge in a moment "Notify the Ministers of the Executive Office to go with them - they should not be willing to miss this opportunity to witness the history."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several years of development, Beipo Mountain is not the first dangerous mining area with only a few narrow mountain roads. The wide cement road and railroad tracks are built along the slope. It takes only one moment to take the train. The clock will reach the top of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower is not far from a row of simple red brick bungalows, and the low eaves are covered with a row of ice ribs that look far less than the south bank of the Chishui River. Those new factory styles. As far as appearance is concerned, it is difficult for anyone to associate it with the "new era." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the house, Anna is commanding the sand people of the original Wonder Club to do the final preparations. When she saw Roland, she secretly compared to "everything." The proper gesture was followed by another serious work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but open his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As early as the radio plan was set, the matter caused a heated discussion in the Executive Office. Most people are well aware of what changes the project will bring to the human world. If the message can be delivered, whether it is for the strength of war or the control of no winter city, it is a great enhancement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wired telephones, flight couriers, and listening signs are proofs - under the combined effect of the three, the old aristocracy of the Grey Fortress has hardly found any comeback Opportunity, many officials once thought that centralization would be a long-term and iterative process, but the fact is that they have not been able to pick up any waves since they were overthrown by the First Army. The reason is that in the face of efficient information transmission, the nobility will be annihilated by the Second Army and even the police force when it reveals a little bit of a sign, and the space for brewing development is not left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the phone has a good root, the latter two are related to the magic, and the officials can barely understand. The iron tower project not only does not have any line connection, but the theoretical effect is stronger than the magic creation, which makes people feel incredible. Although there is a basic introduction to electromagnetic waves in primary school textbooks, you can learn to learn. Many people still have doubts about this invisible and intangible thing. In a sense, it is more than imagined than a biplane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this kind of hot discussion will not affect the actual progress of the project. After all, under the guidance of Roland, there is no winter city in these years. There are so many things, even if he suddenly announces that he will be on the Red Moon, the Executive Office will go all out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the radio is not his specialty, and it’s not as big as the R&D machinery. This set of transceivers is completely re-engraved from the prototype of the Grey House Design Bureau. Come, the actual effect is not clear. With the gesture of Anna, he did not have to worry about losing face in front of the ministers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, let's get started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pulled Anna's hand and brought her to her Before the transmitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...Roland?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is still a receiving location, who do you want to experience the first one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barof and others looked at each other and raised their hands, "Your Majesty Let me come!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some competition, the boss managed to emerge from the crowd with his deepest qualifications and became the first One of the testers of the long distance telegraph communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, the transmission and reception of telegrams can be done by one person, but this time it is obviously easier to verify the test results - for never seen For the radio people, the most important point is how to convince them that the other side of the hundreds of kilometers really received the information transmitted here? The easiest way is to let the unsuspecting receiver report the information that should only be known to the sender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put the test method in a simple way and let the guards fall into Barov’s eyes. Anna scored three horizontal and two points on a small blackboard. The horizontal represents the long sound and the dots represent the short sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everyone confirmed it, she pressed the transmitter's key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——"Three long and two paragraphs." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the circuit is turned on, the bright blue light blooms in the center of the spark gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the button is not connected to the buzzer, there is no other movement in the room except this light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't help but hold your breath. This arc is so small that it's hard to see outside the house, let alone hundreds of kilometers. Silver City outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland couldn’t help but raise the goose bumps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, he seemed to feel something passing by his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that it is an illusion - in the case of low power, electromagnetic waves will not have any effect on the human body. But in his mind, everything is clearly visible. The electric fire seems to be fleeting, and the current that is transmitted is repeatedly oscillated between the inductor and the capacitor, up to tens of millions of times per second. The rapidly changing electric field is rapidly opened along the antenna and the ground, and is in all directions. Spread out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this silent world, it is a humming sound from human beings - no one can hear it, it is brighter than any sound in the past . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after a few hundred kilometers, the wave still disappeared and was recorded by the antenna of Silver City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two receivers are greeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After capturing an electromagnetic wave, an old powder detector turns the metal powder in the glass tube from loose to agglomerated, which causes the resistance in the circuit to suddenly drop. The extinguished bulb glowed with a soft yellow glow. Its biggest role is to inform the listener that the humming sound is echoing over the dome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is the ore detector. It does not require any external power supply and is always in the listening state. A piece of galena and inserted wires form a natural semiconductor-like semiconductor. The energy radiated by electromagnetic waves forms a weak current inside it, and it is necessary to wear headphones to hear the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of buzzing modulation, it does not emit a crisp, pleasing sound, but it still accurately reproduces the frequency of transmission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reversal of this process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance is no longer a problem, how fast it is, how fast it is, or it is light itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna repeated the key three times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the agreement, Yinguangcheng will send an identical message if it receives the message here. If it is a regular way of sending letters, it takes about five to seven days to complete a round trip between the two places, and it takes at least one day to switch to a flight messenger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the moment Anna put down the button, the light on the receiver lights up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
