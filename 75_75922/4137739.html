			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“呜——————————呜——————————”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Snowwind also sounded a thick whistle at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the signal to sail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four seagoing ships in the column followed the sails and separated from the fleet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yueyuewan, Sunset Island, Shallow Water City, Ssangyong Island... The vessels of the four major chambers of commerce followed the Snowwind and slowly sailed to the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original broad vision gradually became blurred, and the sun was dimmed. It was clear that the distance of about a kilometer seemed to enter a completely different world. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the mist of the sky covered the deck, Kamila felt the vibration of the hull disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened... What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, the power unit stopped. "Margaret seems to see her doubts. "The most important thing to sail here is slow. If it is a boat, it is enough to say that the speed of the big boat depends on the water slope. You see the back - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camilla looked in the direction she pointed, and the sailboats that had just raised the sails also lowered the half-sail, and some sails The orientations also contradict each other, which is a scene that cannot be seen in normal navigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, each ship has a blazing brazier to mark its position, but even so, she can only see two The trace of the sea boat, the outline of the third ship has all been hidden in the fog, the faint fire is like a bright fire, and the fourth sea ship disappears like a complete disappearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are going downhill?" Camilla asked with some suspicion. After spending some time in the island, she is no longer ignorant of the sea. When the rising seawater engulfs those caves or fissures, there will be a whirlpool of water on the surface, but the size of the fingers is small, but the big ones can be Up to several meters. But no matter what, the sea will converge from the surrounding to the vortex, and the sooner it is near the end, the faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought that the sea was too wide, and she couldn’t clearly feel the change of ocean currents. At this moment, the fleet has entered the depths of the shadows. The water surface is still so calm, and some can't be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even, she saw algae floating on the water drifting out of the sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the direction of the ocean current has not changed at all, let alone to the bottom of the slope, and there are no signs of turning back - at least in this area in this way! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks incredible, but it is," Margaret nodded. "If the tide is caused by a huge whirlpool, we will not have it at all." Exploring the idea. Because it can affect the vortex of the whole sea, I am afraid that it is deeper than the abyss of hell. It is bound to be a dead end. It is because it is so strange that the Thunder wants to find out." She paused. Looking at Joan, who is staring at the sea, "but people's ability has limits. It is almost impossible to sneak into the sea. It is your help that makes us see hope."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, it is too strange to be seen in this area. Camilla looks at the wet stone pillars and the island reefs, and there are some hairs in my heart - it’s better to be closer. At least you can see the real shape, and those distant reefs have only a few shadows of different depths, just like the ghost claws sticking out in the nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey! Fish! Red fish!" Joan suddenly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kammilla turned his head and saw a bright red "river" suddenly appearing in the right chord of the Snowwind - although it had been told by the Thunder in advance, But when she witnessed it, she still felt the heartfelt shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ghost Shadow Red River."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special channel made up of fish! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't lick your mouth, red scale fish are not delicious." Margaret took a shot of Joan's head. "Just follow the ghostly red river, Can reach the ruins of the triangular towers - Your Highness Tilly should have mentioned it to you. There is a strange instrument like a lookout mirror inside the ruins. You can see a vast continent that you have never seen before. It is also our voyage. The ultimate goal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately, our current destination has nothing to do with the ancient ruins, or you can personally feel the majesty and wonder of the ruins." Business women are all sorry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No... I am still exempt." Camilla decisively said that if she could, she would never want to set foot on the waters again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your reaction and your Highness are really the opposite." Margaret covered his mouth and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a slow sailing for about an hour, the Snowwind stopped at a large island reef, followed by the three seafarers of the four major chambers of commerce - - After the fleet was anchored, the heads of the parties gathered on the flagship deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a lot of it," said the deputy officer of the Snowwind. "I thought you would drive the boat to which reef, then cry. Find someone to help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excellent captains and sailors are not only for you." The people of the four chambers of commerce will naturally not be seen as not heard. "The steel ship is good, but the people on board are not necessarily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh!" The Thunder’s appearance interrupted the dispute in a timely manner. Arrival is the best result. Is there any danger on the road?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the head of the chamber of commerce said, "This time seems to be extraordinarily quiet. I didn’t even touch a sea ghost.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I also feel weird, there are always one or two unlucky ones that will be dragged into the water by sea ghosts. Come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or do we choose routes that avoid ancient ruins, and those monsters prefer to use ruins as nests?"<br />< Br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds a bit reasonable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder sinks for a moment and waved to calm everyone down. "If that's the case, then It is not too late. The ebb tide lasts until the evening, so it is best to go deep into the sea before that. If it is not found, we must leave before the high tide, otherwise it will be trapped in the archipelago. To the two witches, "Joe, Ms. Camilla, I will hand it over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"吖." Joan nodded seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you can make these people shut up." Kamila glanced at the explorers without hesitation. "In advance, I am going to the soul." When you need to concentrate on Unicom, when you call me to interrupt me, don't blame me for not coming back!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting the guarantee of Thunder, she will take the hand On Joan's shoulder, while closing her eyes - after a slight dizziness, another dark picture emerged from her dark eyes, which is Joan's vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go," Camilla said in her heart. "If the contact is interrupted, or if you encounter any dangerous situation, you will immediately return and understand. Don't be reluctant, your friend is still waiting for you to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When referring to the word friend, she clearly felt the other side’s tremor, and then The whole spirit has become firm. "Know it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Joan jumped back and jumped into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cool and comfortable feeling surrounded by Camilla. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fatigue of the whole body seems to be swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she knows that it’s just an illusion, it’s not her own feelings, but Joan – she shares Joan’s happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" asked the Thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is everything going smoothly, about 50 meters in depth," Camilla said. "The stone pillars don't seem to be getting thicker, even the island reefs. ...I don't see things like the seabed or the seamounts. They are all separate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her mission - although Joan I can go freely in the water, but I can't accurately describe what I saw. I want to know as much as I can see what the other party sees. Only the ability to resonate with the heart can be done. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
