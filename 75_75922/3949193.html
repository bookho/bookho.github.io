			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was dragged from the bed by the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning that Nana Wa. Pine’s father came to the door, he was shocked, but soon realized that this was a rare opportunity – I wanted to When the little girl left the month to help fight the demon, she must find a reason for the Pine family to stay in Bentham for the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very difficult thing. The prince’s style and prestige have fallen to the bottom of the nobility, and the relationship with the fortress is tense. It is obviously unlikely that the nobles in the eastern part of the fortress will stay in the town. Roland did not consider cooperating with the nobility from the beginning. They may be good at fighting for power, but they are not suitable for shoulder combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly dressed, simply washed and went to the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tigu. Pine, who was brought here for a long time by the guards, was angry and saw the prince. He immediately stood up, "His Royal Highness." Where is my daughter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time Roland has seen Nana Va's father. He is stout and tall, his face is rough and rough, and the tunic is on the waist, and the big pockets are more like a hunter than a nobleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is very good, Mr. Pine--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why your guards will be direct Let her go in, but stop me outside the door?" Tigu interrupted in a sigh of relief. "I need an explanation, Your Highness! Please bring my daughter out to see me!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the rhythm? Roland groaned. The scene he imagined should be that the other party knew that his daughter had fallen into a witch, or he whispered to conceal the news, or simply let him solve the problem. But he was so aggressive, and he did not act according to the aristocratic courtesy. He did not expect it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why the guards would let Nana Va come in, it’s entirely because of their own account. She came to Anna for two days and the guards were familiar with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering a moment, Roland recruited a maid and asked her to bring Nana Va. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of how rude the other party is, he is still the father of Nana Va, or let the two meet and talk. If he shows a glimpse of giving the little girl to the church or discarding it, it is not too late to take action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa came out with Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of seeing her daughter, the inability of Tiguin Pine’s eyes disappeared immediately. He opened his hand and shouted to Nanawa: "Come on Dad is here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the little girl just hides behind Anna and reveals half of her head. "Will you sell me to the church?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough...what are you talking about, silly boy, the church doesn't accept you as stupid, come home with me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reaction made Roland feel a little confused. According to the nightingale, Nana Wa was seen by her father when she was using magical powers. She panicked and fled to the castle to find Anna. Her father was murderous all the way. The ground catches up to this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now it seems that Tiguwang’s eyes are only concerned and loved by her daughter’s eyes, and it’s not like the abomination of ordinary people to witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you mistaken yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland hesitated and decided to open things up, "Mr. Pine, your daughter is a witch, presumably you know."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you say, Your Royal Highness, I don't understand," said Tigu, who stepped forward and tried to grab Nana's hand, but was stopped by Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Father, I have become a witch... Sorry," Nana whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tigu finally got a little anxious, "Don't talk nonsense! What witch, it is taught by Carl, I knew I shouldn't let you go to college." The set of rhetoric in the church is shit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
