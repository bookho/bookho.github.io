			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the night, the "Skull Wine Cup" became the most lively in the small oasis local. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aosha’s scene against the sandstorm clan, I witnessed it!” An alcoholic sang the fire lanterns and shouted, “Then The black-haired goddess is almost unstoppable! The copper cymbal sound just sounded, she has already rushed to the other god, and a shield knocked her out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The goddess of the sandstorm clan is not Sandra. Shasha? She can turn sand into a nail, or manipulate the gravel attack. How can it be defeated by one blow?" One person questioned, "Even if the reaction is not over, the sand is generally They are all wrapped in front of the body, almost harder than the northern armor, but you can't stop the shield?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still lie to you At that time, it wasn’t me who saw it alone!” The alcoholic screamed unhappy. “The sand armor may be very hard, but I didn’t see it at all. The moment the Aosha goddess rushed over, the sand wrapped around her. It’s all spilled on the ground, it’s all about using a face to resist the other side’s blow. You all know the first duel. , Aosha goddess alone with more than a dozen bone-cutting warriors, the strength, such as not being killed on the spot is already merciful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "All spilled on the ground... Is she wearing a stone of gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe, I don't know much, but cut bones and The duelist of the sandstorm must have worn the stone, perhaps this thing does not work for her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The goddess who is not afraid of the god stone... How is this possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not interrupt?" Someone dissatisfied, "Give this a glass of wine and let him continue!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," the drinker sipped a new hop, and then said, "The sandstorm clan probably didn't expect his goddess to fall first, and the formation suddenly became chaotic - they The number of people dispatched is only half of the upper limit. It must be the battle of the goddess as the core. When the goddess falls, the next victory or defeat is not suspenseful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still not dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, fifteen people, all survived, either on the shoulder or in the knee, or by the goddess!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly sounded a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, this is nothing," the drinker said of the rise, directly stood on the bar and attracted everyone’s attention. "The day before yesterday." The duel is so memorable! Aosha challenges the Blackwater clan, a big clan known for its bravery and brutality! You should have heard of the name of Blackwater, and any duelist meets them, and few people can survive. They don't have gods, but they are all first-class warriors, and they have sent 30 people! Compared to the first two games, it is a bloody kill, but --"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence "but" let the pub's arguments calm down, everyone is waiting for him to say the latter sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, no one has died on the high platform of the burning place!" The drinker sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible! I went to Tiesha City today to do business. The people in the city are talking about the heavy losses of the Blackwater clan, their stone castle front. They all hang up the black flag, obviously mourning, but you said they didn't die alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, erect your ears and hear what I said," The alcoholic swayed his fingers. "I said that no one died on the duel!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can testify this," soon someone shouted "I was there at the time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I have not caught up with the second round of the sacred duel, but I have not missed the day before yesterday. It can even be said that... blood flow into the river, it is simply incredible to do this!" Another person also echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What exactly does that mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The maid, give him three more cups!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, it is well understood that the black-haired goddess did not give the Blackwater clan a chance, but even if they were broken With his hands or his feet folded, he still wants to use his teeth to bite a piece of meat. In this case, she can only let the other side have no counterattack ability--" The alcoholic deliberately paused here, "Goddess used one With a long handle, they cut off their hands and feet and then kicked them one by one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A hand or a foot is broken, If you are bandaging in time, there is hope that you will survive, but your hands and feet will be broken. It is almost impossible to support you back to Tiesha City. You can kill their lives by bloodshed! But can this blame the Aosha clan?" He poured A big sip of wine, asked in a row, "You said, can you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, they haven’t done this before, this is also forced to helpless. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least not dead on the stage, it is enough to prove that the goddess has no intention of killing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to say that Blackwater is really alive, and I don’t see who the opponent is. I thought this is a desperate fight." The appearance can scare the proud sand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, Give everyone a fire lantern, the money counts on my head!" Someone looked to the second floor of the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram, who has been relying on the second floor window, clapped his hands. "No, this round counts me, everyone has it, respects the sand - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"敬傲沙!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of cheers in the downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram drank the wine from the cup and spit it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been more and more guests visiting the "Skull Glass" in the past week, the original spacious first floor has become overcrowded, and people have only discussed One, that is the holy duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, not only the pub, the whole small oasis has become overcrowded, and wherever he goes, he can see the dead or the half dead from each clan. Asking about the news of Aosha everywhere, this was never possible in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because too much population will impose a great burden on oasis managers, it will consume less grain in the granary, and it is easy to attract unscrupulous Challenger. According to the practice of the watchdog, the small oasis only accepts the sand people who can bring benefits to the place - either a businessman or a warrior who wants to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the clan scattered in every corner of the Yinchuan Oasis like this, it is entirely out of the order of the new owner Zall Silvermoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is only the former Thuram, the daily work is to earn some golden dragons for the watchdog, and by the way, give yourself a Savings, if you encounter such a situation, you will only be able to ask for it. But now he has been tied to the fate of the Aosha clan, and it is exhausted just to let the people control the order of the small oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the new owner also considered this point. After the first duel, Zall left him in an oasis and concentrated on controlling the situation behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure adequate food supply, the iron axe not only pulled a batch from the bone-bone clan, but also took out Jinlong to buy it from two other small oases. The day after the rejection was swept out by the Gray Fort Army, and the territory was directly exchanged as a trade item for a more abundant Yinchuan tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at this point, he has completely failed to understand what the Aosha group is playing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let a unscathed tribal group become a challenger, and let the warriors of the Shaping Clan and the Sharon Clan, so that they can recover after a short rest Strength, even if you want to be the head of the clan, it makes no sense to do this kind of thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that makes Thuram feel a little comforting is that the goddesses brought back by Zall Silver Moon are really powerful, and each time they play for four people. However, they have defeated the three major clan continuously, and now there are only two left in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
