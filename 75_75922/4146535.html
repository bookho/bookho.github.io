			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter Kingdom, North Port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't push! Line up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luggage is lost, not allowed Take the boat! The king of the gray castle will give you enough food and clothes, throw them into the water if you want to live!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Point! Women and children are preferred!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The port area is crowded with people, and a large number of refugees flock to the sea-going vessels that are raising sails, if not the First Army and the Guards Use the sword to maintain order, I am afraid that the narrow bridges will instantly become the road to hell for the weak meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, this boat... I’m afraid it’s not enough.” The soldier in charge of the guard looked back worriedly, when a boat full of refugees was slowing down. Leave the harbour slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dare to come to the North Port at this time, it is already a good man," Sang Shu's gaze has never left the muzzle - In just three or four days, the red mist has spread from the shackles of the desperate, like thick blood on the skyline, so that people can be suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Head...will you leave a seat for us?" The man groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's a nail," Sang Shu smiled. "Even if you don't get on the boat, you will give us a pit."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than half a month ago, they received a transfer order, left the Hermes Plateau, and went to the northernmost winter city to be responsible for the transfer of immigrants. Compared with the sacred city, the nails seemed to be a lot easier after receiving new orders. There were a lot more words along the way. After arriving at the North Port, they started their work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one hundred people are not the first gray-great people to reach Yongdong, and more of their robes have already penetrated the whole country and carried out the residents there. evacuation. The evacuation was not going smoothly at the beginning, until the emergence of the Red Moon, which made the situation better – thanks to the earlier rumors that the red moon represented the end of the world, so the sky was true. When the bloody red moon appeared, many local people frightened their courage and directly found the army station to ask to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the good times are not long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After only four or five days, there was news of red fog in front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the first army then handed over the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winners were not aware of them, but the result was that all the leading teams began to retreat south, and the nail team received an order to return to the next port. However, it is only in these days that the number of refugees has increased several times. Every day, tens of thousands of people come to the North Port and ask the sea boats to bring them. Go together. The nails couldn't sit on the crowd and build a simple line of defense on the spot. They informed the rear troops through the flight messenger and asked for more ships. This made the evacuation plan postponed for several days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Uncle Sang knows that once the news spreads, there will be fewer and fewer ships sailing to the north - these fjord merchant ships with their commissions They will never use their own lives to make a living. They may go out of Hong Kong with their heads, but they will never arrive... According to the current momentum, this should be the last batch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because nails should be clear about this, so they will have buried the explosives early in the morning, one will be able to withstand the enemy when necessary, and the other is Destroy the equipment that can't be taken away, so as not to fall into the hands of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, there is smoke rising in front!" someone shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you coming again..." Sang Shu spit, "Everyone is here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; In the absence of sufficient manpower and witch detection, the old method of communication once again played a role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time the devil has visited the North Port, and now there are several devils lying in the wilderness outside the town. According to the manual distributed above, almost It is a madman. Although the enemies are sparsely populated and the grades are not high, it means that they have indeed appeared on the land of the Wing Dong Kingdom, and they are a little closer to the place as the red mist spreads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
