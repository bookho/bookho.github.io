			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the second warship is turning halfway through, the situation is worse than the first one. In the face of the iron-clad boat that rushed straight, the mice were so frightened that a few of them could still resist and slammed the arrow at the enemy, but they couldn’t make a difference with the tiny needles in front of such a giant. I can't see a single print on the iron plate. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the iron boat carrying the unstoppable force hit the center of the eagle boat at an almost vertical angle, smashing more than ten long paddles. Then Eden witnessed an incredible scene - under the combined action of water and impact, the side of the ship was pushed into the water and the enemy's ship was arched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is like a sloping shore, generally lifting the bow and then squatting on the deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagle’s boat suddenly screams and screams, and the still-lived mice are diving and escaping. Those who are cut off are only screaming on the sloping deck. Roll up and leave a trace of blood. Eden watched as the iron boat slowly descended, and the narrow ship that was overwhelmed by himself was out of a series of bangs. The wooden boat was not as strong as the beach. Under heavy pressure and pushing, the hull suddenly came from it. Disconnected, both ends swelled up and picked up the blossoming water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warship that broke into two pieces did not sink quickly, but fell like a corpse on the river, only revealing the side of the side. The appearance of the iron-shelled ship looks intact and continues to fly towards itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eden heard a sound of inhalation, and the four eagle boats were instantly lost in half, and the one he commanded would be under One, at that moment, he has already prepared for a jetty escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fortunately, he is gambling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that this ship is completely close to the shore, the enemy is on the right path and chasing the last Baron Derik who fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put up the bow and the fire stick!" After a long breath, Eden snorted loudly. "We want to kill this group and hide." The beast in the iron shell! Every time I kill an enemy, I will reward him with a golden dragon! Have you heard it? A golden dragon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you escape like this To the king, even if he can survive, he has no possibility of promotion. The only chance is to defeat the rebel ship and take it to Tiffco's majesty – even if the ship is made by Hell Devil. Come out, as long as the above people are still the same as themselves, there is still the possibility of defeating the victory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no crushing of the enemy ships like ants, and the courage of the sailors’ hearts was back. These people were all doing the same. Live, used to see the bloody scene - as long as it is not a one-sided slaughter, they are still interested in fighting for Jinlong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the determination that it will not be hit, the eagle boat leaves the river bank, moves forward with the iron-shell ship, and slowly moves closer to its channel, and then The person quickly caught up with the parallel position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the other party is about to pass by, the distance between the two ships is only a few meters, and the sailors are carrying a variety of weapons, ready to hit the first round, waiting for the ships to close together. After jumping and going to kill, this is also the usual method of dealing with merchant ships. But the deck of the enemy ship was empty, and only a long black tube at the tail was aimed at the sailor who was about to move. The long tube was surrounded by iron, and only a row of small holes was exposed in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eden hasn’t had time to figure out what it’s like, the front of the iron pipe has spurted a long flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd standing in a row suddenly raised a bloody fog, the spattered wood debris and flesh and blood were everywhere, the sailors were like cutting wheat. When the batch fell, the responders began to look for shelters, but neither the barrel nor the mast did anything. The position of the iron pipe pointed to where the god of death was, the bucket was torn and shattered, and the mast could not withstand such a terrorist weapon. The continuous blow, with a burst of screams broken into two, the upper part of the canvas fell into the water, the eagle boat that lost the main power suddenly slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eden’s fantasy didn’t show up, he probably understood that it should be a kind of musket, but it’s just too fast, it’s turned into a bang A continuous stream of sizzling sounds. It’s just that he can’t figure it out completely. Why is it that the loading is very slow? The weapon that is very poor and the poor is in the hands of the rebel can do this step... Perhaps, only the power of the devil can explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
