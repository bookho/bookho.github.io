			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The key to ending the battle of divineness has been found..." Victor whispered, "Your Majesty is determined to take the initiative to meet the enemy and end the war beyond the fertile plains." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after experiencing so many incredible things, this report is still full of shock, almost every line of words is worthy of a book - in the past This kind of news can't be known by anyone outside the royal family, let alone a civilian businessman who has no title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report outlines an extremely spectacular picture: the previously sensational floating land fell into the sea without declaring the end of the devil's offensive, thousands of miles away. A new Blackrock fortress is coming around the city without the winter city. And below it, there are thousands of devils - this amount is enough to drown the entire human kingdom! In order to avoid the arrival of this scene, His Majesty decided to take the initiative to attack, so that the war will not spread to ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting to defeat the incoming enemy, the expeditionary army will travel to the other end of the world and the junction of the two continents to relieve the threat of the war of divine. Once successful, long-lasting peace will come, and neither the devil nor the evil beast will threaten human security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is not unfamiliar with this kind of expedition. After more than a year, he witnessed the birth of a miracle - relying on the name The heavy machinery of the train, the first army of a large number of people and horses lived in the uninhabited fertile plains nearly five hundred kilometers, defeated the devil in the ruins of the north. At that time, the Greysburg Weekly recorded in detail all the passages of this battle. Through the photo painting called "photograph", until now he can recall his feelings from the aerial view when the black trains gallop on the plains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time Roland’s Majesty seems to be doing more thoroughly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is going to raise a mountain into the air and become the stronghold of this expedition! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this really what humans can do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor can't wait to turn to the second page - I saw that the plan was divided into three parts, the first is the lift-off phase, together with the North Slope Mountain Nearly one kilometer of land below will be separated from the desolate mountains and become an independent whole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the trial phase, the North Slope Mountain will be included in the military sequence, and officially awarded the name "Ellino Airship." During this time, it will patrol many times around the winter city. In addition to the necessary combat training, it is also waiting for the right time to attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final stage is the official departure, refusing to be thousands of miles away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive Office called it a war that determines the destiny of mankind. In addition to the army, the support of workers in all walks of life is also crucial, so the reward for work is quite Rich, basically two to three times the average of the industry. Not only that, the names of any participants will be engraved into the monument, standing within the king city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the hand of the king, Barov, also revealed at the end that the people on the island may have the opportunity to see the most powerful weapon in human history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see this, Victor knows that the Executive Office will definitely be blocked. The residents of No Winter City are compared with those from other cities. The biggest difference is that the land is treated as if it were. When he gets along with the locals, he often has the illusion that this place belongs not only to Roland but also to them. And once settled and obtained an identity card, similar identity will soon spread, because he feels deeply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly from the morning kingdom, he will feel a sense of pride when he hears outsiders talking about the miracles of no winter, which has never been seen before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not for the family business, Victor also has the urge to climb the sky and see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Help me contact the Executive Office and say that Rainbow Stone is willing to donate 1,000 sets of clothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Understood." Linglong nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, did you hear the exact date of the lift in North Slope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be these two days, the top of the mountain has become completely different from before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, as long as the problem can be solved with money, it is a big deal for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Package on me, adult." Delicate smiled and took the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the First Army pulled down a long cordon at the foot of the mountain This makes everyone without winter city aware that the long-awaited moment is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the North Slope Mountain has completely changed its appearance, looking from a distance, it is surrounded by dense scaffolding, the original irregular mountain wall Like being artificially trimmed, not only has it been smoothed out, but many places have also been patched - those that are either metal plates or oil-film cloths have no match with the rock itself, but make this natural thing even more It is like a weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What shocked Victor most was the hundreds of long strips that fell from height. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are like the skirts of the mountains, undulating in the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tower and the rifle symbolize the kingdom of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three-color combination of red and black is even more solemn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This visual impact is absolutely unforgettable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more people gathering on the street. At noon, a few main roads are leaking. If it is not the black police and the army, the flow of people will be hidden. On the forest side, I am afraid that half of the city will be paralyzed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a loud alarm sounding over the city, Victor, who was in the perfect position on the roof of West Street, felt a tremor under his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, this tremor turned into a loud bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the whole winter-free city seems to be boiling--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is the mountains are torn Cracked sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he had expected it, he really showed his mouth to the maximum when he witnessed this scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exquisitely grasped his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the north slope mountain rises slowly but unstoppable, and the mountain part connected to it emits a cluster of dust and stands on the ground. The scaffolding collapsed, as if it were unable to bind this huge general. After the fallen trees, gravel and iron frame were squatted underneath, the larger bottom lifted the "dandruff" that fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole scene is like pulling out the radish to bring out the mud, but this time the mud is a land of one kilometer wide, it shows a distinct inverted triangle The lowest point is located in the center of the floating island. With the rise of the North Slope Mountain, a huge pit was left on the ground. In the face of the suddenly disappearing top cover, countless animals that were active in the underground escaped and became a vivid footnote in this historic scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be something that manpower can't do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the flag fluttering on the mountain is unmistakably declared. It belongs to the Grey Fort Kingdom and belongs to mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the shock, there was a deafening cheer in the crowd. When the first sound appeared, it was destined to calm down in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enthusiasm of the atmosphere has faded for a long time, and Victor licked some dry lips. When he was preparing to take the exquisite back to the hotel, Yu Guang suddenly Sweeping the figure of an old man on the opposite roof - the figure is so familiar that even his footsteps are slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor wants to take a closer look and finds that the other party has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, what's wrong?" Linglong seems to have noticed his strangeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, nothing... probably wrong." Victor hesitated. Because no matter which way, the old man is somewhat similar to his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
