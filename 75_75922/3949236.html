			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves feel that the whole body is solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two shadows in the night on the left, which are huge and strange, not the common evil beast. Closer, the leaves only discovered that it was actually two human-like creatures riding on the back of the hybrid. Their bodies are tall, twice as large as normal people, without armor, and they can't wear clothes made of materials. No, they say that the clothes are very stubborn, but they are like swollen animal skins, wrapped from head to toe. Strict and solid, many places swell up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking thing is the headgear worn by the two, which is obviously the transformation of the head of the evil beast, which is horrible. The skull was dug up and stitched with a reddish-brown spar. A patched skin tube extends from the lower edge of their head and extends into the huge carapace behind it. There are also a number of spears in one person's mount, and one wears a strangely shaped iron glove - from the outside, they only have three fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one word in the heart of the leaf: "Devil." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meet the enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hakala first responded, her piercing scream Pull everyone's attention back to the enemy. The stone woman reached out and pressed it to the ground, turning the vast snow in front of her into a soft swamp. This is a very correct response: the mount of the other side is a blend of wolf heads and wings, which is fast and can fly short distances. But these two obviously can't, their wings have been cut, and the bare bones are tied with twine and held in the hands of the devil. Flying over this swamp, they have to go around, which will give other sisters time to react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the enemy did not act according to the witchesâ€™ thoughts. They drove the mount forward and plunged into the swamp, then by the impulse, from the evil beast Jumping up, crossed the distance of a few feet, and fell behind the stone woman. And there, it is the place where non-combat sisters gather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly spread!" The leaves have not fallen, and the devil wearing three-finger iron gloves has been smashed in the crowd. His agility was completely out of shape, and a close-knit witch was able to react in the future and was shattered by a punch. Then two sisters were squeezed by the thick iron hand, and the others woke up and fled in panic. Only Silko stood in the same place. Although her ability was not suitable for combat, she did not turn and fled. Instead, she took off her bow from the back and shot it at the enemy. The iron hand devil escaped sideways and lifted his foot to kick her out. The strength of the road is as big as a thunder. The little girl flew out of the distance and rolled to the ground, and the mouth could not stop bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil carrying the spear turned back and walked toward the stone girl who had already been scared to be overwhelmed. Just as the spear was about to penetrate the witch's chest, a flame exploded in front of him. The red pepper rolled from the enemy's armpit and pulled the stone girl's hand and turned to run. The other party wanted to catch up, but was stopped by a black wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaves all the magic into the earth, all kinds of plants grow out, entangled into a barbed vine, climbed to the iron hand devil, Hakala summoned the "bitter pain The devil snake also bite on the other's arm. Just as he waved his hands and ridiculed the annoying snakes, the vines that came quietly from behind fell suddenly, entangled his feet, and then pulled back, and the huge body of the enemy crashed into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Run, sisters, run!" the leaves shouted, fear made her voice tremble. Run away, hurry away from these terrible monsters, they are the source of evil recorded in the ancient book, the devil from the door of hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake's tormenting venom seems to be ineffective for them, and the iron hand that fell to the ground got up and seemed to want to grab the vines that stalked him everywhere, holding spears The devil saw the companion's difficulty, and soon turned his attention to the leaves that were manipulating the vines. He raised his spear and put it in a throwing position, and his arm quickly expanded. The bulging skin is stretched to a thin layer, and even dark red blood vessels and bones can be seen through the cortex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leaves, beware!" The stone girl once again turned the ground into a quagmire, this time directly applied to the opponent's feet. The devil slammed down, and the throwing spear instantly changed direction. It was inserted obliquely into the ground in front of the leaves. Nearly one of the tall spears almost fell into the ground, scaring the leaves out of a cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inflated arm quickly shrank after the spear was thrown, and soon became like dry wood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear devil can't throw continuously! She immediately realized that now is a good time to escape. Other witches also noticed this. The stone woman and the red pepper, chasing the wind over the iron hand still struggling on the ground, ran to the unattended Hakala, want to bring the mentor to leave. Only the leaves saw that the devil pulled by the vines extended his hands to the three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
