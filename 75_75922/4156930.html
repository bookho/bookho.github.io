			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, other workers were aware of the same, and they stopped to look at the black-pressed birds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham understood the urgency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not an alarm used by the city, but a wartime warning of the First Army. This means that the enemy is approaching the army, and the battle can start at any time...or, at the moment the alarm sounds here, they are already fighting the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the devil come back again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too ridiculous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed his father from the fascinating forest to the No. 10 site, and the situation in the north is basically counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the First Army will transform the ruins of Takira is to prevent this. On the vast plains, a towering tower is enough to see an area ten kilometers away. Let's not say that the red fog whistle takes time to build. Light from the ruins of the holy city to this winter-free development is three or four hundred. Kilometers, how did the enemy directly penetrate into the position so close to the new king without warning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now is not the time to go into this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post that is responsible for the No. 2 development site is only a hundred people stationed, and it is also a rotation of recruits. If they are really attacked, they can successfully defeat the devil. , to ensure that this place is safe and sound? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham’s heart is completely unfinished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bossan suddenly ran towards the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xia is still on the train, I want Go pick her up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer also reminds Cham - according to the evacuation regulations, everyone should evacuate to the nearest refuge after hearing the alarm, but The loading and unloading platform is located at the outermost edge of the development site. It takes a long time for them to go to the residential area, let alone the return. Instead of taking the Xia to the refuge, it is better to leave by train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is here!" Cham took off his badge and held it in his hands. "I was the first army soldier, Chalm, and the second exploit was attacked." Everyone puts down the goods and comes with me - it is too far from the refuge, we go to the train to avoid the danger!" After he finished, he added a small whisper, "It used to be."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one heard his whisper, the first military name said the moment of the exit, the workers regarded him as the leader, those who had already been running south also stopped and gathered. Go to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of scene makes Chalm a little unexpected, but the pressure is multiplied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he belonged to the first military sequence, he was a watchman on the Heihe River, a miscellaneous soldier under his father, and never had the experience of leading others. Suddenly a group of people who need to be responsible for it, he could not help but raise a flaw. Only the words have been exported, he can only hold on to the scalp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go here!" Cham took the workers all the way to the train, just hitting Hank, who was overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Man, man, what happened? I just found a corner to be convenient..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't care so much," Cham grabbed his shoulder. "Is coal and water added? How is the pressure of the boiler?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter nodded in a panic, "is in a state of waiting, can start at any time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good!" he shouted. "You are now rushing to pull the steering rod back. We are going backwards to the first station. Remember to whistle reminder before sending the brakes. Do you understand it? Also, put the gun on it and put it at your fingertips." Place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
