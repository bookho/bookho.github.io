			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner, after waiting for Jielu to return to the room to review his homework, Roland agreed Came to the front of 0827. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking a few door panels, the door slammed open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia is still the cold expression, "Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the house Roland found that her decoration was much better than her apartment. The floor was replaced with solid wood flooring, a special shoe cabinet was placed at the door, and a crystal chandelier was placed on the top of the head. Even the white paint on the wall was brushed again. Look at the finish, you know, it is not the original paint of the early pre-brushing of the package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no extra slipper, you should wear me first," she pointed to a pair of furry rabbit ear slippers on the bottom of the shoe cabinet. "I Like to wear a large size, it should not be too small for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland tried to put his foot into the shoe, the small is not small, but This is winter slippers. I feel hot when I put it on, and the two groups of fluffy rabbit ears on the slippers... He can't imagine what Garcia would look like when he wore this pair of slippers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the same as her indifference to a thousand miles away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the sofa and sat down. "Right, do you have water here? The dinner may have more salt."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiasia frowned and glanced at him. "Only ice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ice is all right." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her opportunity to turn to the kitchen, Roland probes look into the back room - all the units in the package are basically the same, but the two neighbors are symmetric Only. 0827 is the next door next door, so this passage facing the gate must lead to the utility room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, he saw a similarly sized compartment at the end of the passage, but Garcia apparently had refurbished it and replaced it. Push and pull the louver door. The good news is that this kind of sliding door is generally not locked. The bad news is that she will dismantle the iron door during the renovation and rebuild the outer wall again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Garcia returned to the living room with water, Roland had pretended to be nothing, leaning on the sofa to watch the show on TV. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you," he picked up the glass. "You live alone here? When the parents met in the morning, they all said that you are a Sanye family... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not," Garcia interrupted coldly. "The three leaves have nothing to do with me, and can even be said to be enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy?" Roland groaned, "Then your cousin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They I just saw this and wanted my cousin to persuade me to go back." Her look was a little depressed. "If I left, the group would be able to let go of the building."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "So the mall expansion plan next door is the project of the Sanye Group?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who else dare to dismantle these cultural relics?" Doubt, "You obviously live in the building, why don't you even know this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s bad...the other person is not a cleansing, but a mature mind. Adult, If then inherit the Three Kings woman character, even harder fooled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough... I rarely care about the streets, and I lost my job a while ago, and I haven’t been out for almost half a year," Roland I quickly changed the subject. "Do you have any other work besides participating in the competition?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the game is equivalent to the test and tempering It is not the most important content to publicize the martial arts and win prizes to the audience. The erosion against the outside world is our top priority."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What erosion?" Awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
