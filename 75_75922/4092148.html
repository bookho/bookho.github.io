			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flying monster with a hairless flesh, looks ugly, wild and fierce, and the strange tail that seems to have been heard before— —<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, is this inexplicable familiar voice not from the white pigeon that is particularly intimate with the ashes? Luo Jia’s mind suddenly flashed an image that had been conceived for a long time. Could it be true? “Mc茜?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shouted subconsciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wolf, wolf actually talked!" The behemoth made a strange scream, squinting back and forth several steps, this move made the wolf female The action suddenly stagnated in place, and for a moment I didn’t know if it should be rushed. Although it is not clear why the other party is going to launch a sneak attack, it is also a good opportunity to compare. It is just that the giant beast looks like a panic, and she doubts who is the attacker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a witch, stupid," suddenly another voice came from the top of his head, with a hint of tenderness in his crispness. "Who are you, why do you know us?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia looked up and couldn't help but blink his eyes - it was floating in the air, the position was just overlapping with the sun, the glare of the sun from She was blooming around her, only to see her flying golden short hair and a silver-colored weapon in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this guy seems to be young, the combat experience is surprisingly rich, and the skills that dazzle the opponent against the sun are not something that ordinary people can master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there is no such thing as a test, Luo Jia has also taken over her hand - although she likes to challenge, it is not the kind of no matter whether the other party is willing to entangle The ritual, plus the ashes of the slogan "There will be a big mold in the end with the wheat scorpion," on the road of practicing alone, it is better to get less trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put down her bag and changed it to human form. "I am Luojia from the desert. Burning fire, come here with Ashes and Andrea." She mentioned it on the road... um, McMug.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ah, I remembered,” the giant beast’s body shape also quickly Shrinking, in the blink of an eye, it became a small point that only reached her waist. The long white hair was almost dragged to the ground. "When I went to the ashes, I saw this person!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She didn't mention me?" The little girl shouted dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your name is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning, the greatest in the West, wrong, yes The greatest explorer of the entire Grey Fort!" She stammered and fell in front of the wolf woman. "You remember it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Hey... why are you taking off your clothes?” Mai said curiously at her chest and touched her. “Is this also changed? Oh!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning retracts the knife on the head of the wheat stalk. "The difference in ability is nothing, you should not stare at people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia On the jacket, "The reason why you attacked me is...?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you were a snow scorpion that only mutated," she folded confidently. Full of expression, a little embarrassed, "It is our job to clean up the evil beasts that are still wild, to bring fresh prey to the castle, and to monitor the entire northwest."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "There are ostrich nests, picking hives and grilled wild glutinous rice bran!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not work!" Lightning quickly interrupted, "In short, this area Almost no one came, and the evil moon has just passed, so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that." Luo Jia nodded and accepted this statement - Every time the demon moon, the North China border will become a rumor that she has been criticized more than once. After fighting with the four-winged eagle, she also learned a lot about the mixed species of evil beasts from the ashes. If the patrol in the air, it would not be uncommon to regard the huge desert wolf as a wolf-shaped evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about you?" asked the little girl. "This is a wild land, not only the remnants of the evil beasts, but also the more terrible things, you What do people want to do here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
