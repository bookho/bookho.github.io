			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Roland heard the report of the iron axe, he temporarily suspected that his ear had a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that you saw the vast desert in the echo of the song, and brought back a grain of sand from the desert?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditory hallucination is gone, even the illusion comes out, is this really a song? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not brought back, Your Highness," the iron axe put the gravel in front of the desk in a serious manner. "I was completely in a state of being at that time, I didn't even think about it." Verify that those scenes are true. It is like suddenly appearing in my hands. If you have to say it, should it be the flying sand brought by the hot air?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more I said, the more mysterious, Roland thought for a moment, "She only sang this song?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some songs, but I can't listen at all. "The iron axe recalls, "The scene at the time was like a miracle... If it was before, the silver moon adult would claim to be the messenger of the three gods, and I would be convinced. Your Highness, is this her ability to evolve?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following myself for more than a year, it is obvious that this Mojinshamin has a certain understanding of the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be, but this is the first time I have met," Roland thought for a moment and decided to call the echo to ask for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for the iron axe to leave, Roland pinched the sand and looked at it carefully. "Is this a magical creation?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unclear," came the sound of the nightingale behind him. "There is no trace of magic on it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No magic traces don't mean It is not an object created by magic, but this material is a reality. It does not need to be maintained by magic, and it will not be affected by the stone of God, such as Soroya's painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echo came to the study very quickly, and the nightingale appeared on the side of Roland for the first time and smiled at her: "Congratulations."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter stunned, "I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night nodded, "The magic in your body has condensed, you Didn't find it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, really?" echoed and said, "Is this saying that my abilities have evolved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What does it look like?" Roland said in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A piece of blue transparent crystal that is as clear as water," answered the nightingale. "The total amount of magic is comparable to that of wheat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this evolution has nothing to do with epiphany, but unknowingly completes the condensate, and Roland is very surprised when she tells the illusion of the iron axe and the echo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said...he seems to be back in the extreme south, in the sand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The word "as if" is worth considering, because when he returns from the desert, he still has a grain of sand on his body," Roland said with a smile. "Although there is such a thing in the sand, he does not plan to open the snow." I found out one from the mud to lie to me. He paused. "What did you see at the time?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing..." The echo was a little embarrassed. "I closed my eyes and didn't pay attention to the changes around me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a good show for us now," Roland held his chin with interest. "Use the hometown song you created yourself." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, that's right," he affirmed. "There is still half an hour from dinner time, which will not affect other people." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also want to hear songs that make people immersive," the Nightingale greeted with enthusiasm.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The echo took a deep breath, and soon, the mixed sonata that did not belong to this era rang, and the sweet voice of the woman’s unique voice was surrounded by the study. At first she was still somewhat cautious, probably never singing indoors. However, as the tunes gradually entered, she was fully involved in the music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland seems to have heard the hot air blowing through the green forest, the temperature in the room seems to have increased a few points, and the nose also radiated from the sun-baked sand. Taste... When the aftermath slowly dissipated, Roland recollected it for a long time before returning from the music. Undoubtedly, this is a lyrical song full of exotic customs. For him, he couldn’t pick up anything wrong with him. However, he didn’t see the desert, he was still sitting in the study room, flowing. The oasis of the brook water is missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the nightingale, who shook his head at him, apparently she did not see those strange illusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the ability not effective? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you only written this song?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the echo nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That sing a few songs that I teach you," he thought, deciding, "Let everyone come and listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the study was full of witches, and even the three sleeping islands came over, even though they still had a stack of unfinished cards in their hands. The echo was slightly nervous, but with Wendy's encouragement, she slowly recovered her calmness and sang all the songs including the Guerrilla Song. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These songs all received the warm applause of the witches without exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After asking the feelings of everyone, Roland also had a rough judgment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the extent to which the influence of the song depends on the subjective experience of the listener. The person who has the same experience as the song atmosphere has more influence and judgment. In the modern songs that I taught, everyone’s reflection on the guerrillas’ songs is the best. I want to think about it, just because the witches have seen the first army’s scenes with the drums stepping forward, and they can understand the meaning of the tunes. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sand people like the iron axe can naturally resonate with the music full of extreme southern customs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the deepest impact of this kind of effect, Roland is temporarily unable to pass the test to know... If the sensation is fully invested, everything in the illusion will become real Reality? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what, the new ability of echo still makes him full of expectations - for example, inspiring soldiers, appease the masses, and cooperating with future dramas... can drive the audience People with emotions are immeasurable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next afternoon, Roland summoned Vader from Bentham Town in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The temple, His Royal Highness... I, I am coming..." His teeth trembled, apparently not recovering from the high-speed flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now want to travel quickly between the two places, the only way to get around is Mai Mai Express, of course, even if wrapped in a thick blanket, in the giant claw Flying at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour is still not a comfortable experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job," Roland patted the fat pigeon on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" The latter proudly raised his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call you over, I want you to help the aristocrats of the Elk family train a team," he looked at Vader. "The situation here is different." In Bianbu Town, there are mice, refugees, and extremely sinister criminals. There are several similarities to Jinsuicheng."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vader baked at the fireplace After a while, I finally stopped shaking. "You mean... let me form a patrol?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s the police." Roland will crack The plan tells the story. "The first half will be led by the First Army, but the security of the fortress will still have to be handed over to the police for maintenance. As the police, the most important thing is the idea of ​​being a "people's protector." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
