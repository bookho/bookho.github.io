Your Majesty, the two counts refused to obey your rule, and tried to collude with the rest of the nobles to rebel. The father saw through their tricks in advance and gave them two punishments." Regretfully, "But due to my negligence, I didn't expect you to return to the West in advance. The head of the evidence has been broken on the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Do your father directly kill the two counts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," he looked at his assistant, "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vote is more intense than you expected... Take the names of the two counts as names, which means that it is difficult for them to get the support of the Eastern aristocracy, at least unite against themselves. The possibility of territory is greatly reduced. Roland thought, but now the nightingale is not around, and I don’t know if the other person is deceiving herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He indulged for a moment and whispered to Barov next to him. "Do you have these two families in the North?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ma Taus and Double Gunsta are both family members in the North, and their reputation is even more prominent than the five in the West. The ancestors of Lista have fought for the Wimbledon family. The double gun on the family emblem is taken from the flag of the gray castle kingdom.” Barov said with a beard, he said slowly, “Of course, this is something more than two hundred years ago. It’s the name of Kant’s family. It doesn't matter, I remember it was a family that only appeared in the past 50 years... I didn't expect Tiefko to pick Calvin Kant as the northern governor, even if it was to contain the other two, the difference in strength would be difficult. To the role it deserves, it is easy to cause dissatisfaction of the veteran family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what is he really saying?" Roland automatically ignored the latter section of the boss. To show off the broad knowledge of learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm...the possibility of lying is not great," Barov whispered. "It’s about the glory of the nobility, if you promise to accept their loyalty. If the pass is confirmed to be lying, the Northland itself will be chaotic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes sense, he slightly decapitated, and is not a lie problem The key is that your bottom line is already there. If you can accept the right to abandon the land, you can talk about it. If you insist on grasping the authority, then the precious gift is meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Roland smiled at Cole. "First of all, I have to express my gratitude to the Duke. Maintaining royal honor is the responsibility of every nobleman. You The father did a very good job. Secondly, the two counts deserved the crime, and the kingdom would not pursue the Duke of Kant’s move.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes, is it? Father will be very I am glad to hear this," Cole said with a sigh of relief. "He always hopes to work for the real king. Now he finally has a chance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am also very happy to accept the loyalty of the Duke of the Northland...provided that he can follow the new law of the Grey Fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New Law? He gave a slight glimpse, "What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Regulations on the recovery of the power of the nobility," Roland looked at each other's look, one word at a time, "In the future, the kingdom will no longer divide the nobility. You can simply understand that there is only one master in all the territory of the gray fort, that is the king." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Your Majesty, this..." Cole’s expression changed a lot and turned to look at the assistant again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this guy the second son of the Duke? Although it looks younger, it is not even as good as his female official... At least the latter is only slightly open, and the appearance is still calm - of course, she may not understand the meaning of her own words. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without worry, the nobility is still aristocratic, your life will not change, and there is still a chance to climb a new peak," Roland clap Let the attendant hand over the "propaganda manual" that has already been prepared. "The long song fortress has fully implemented this law. In the manual, you can see many small stories of change, as well as examples of nobles who are involved in this." It seems to make the nobility lose some of its privileges, but it actually liberates the nobility from the fiefdom and joins the kingdom and even the whole world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cole's performance made Roland slightly disappointing, but it is normal to think about it. After all, it is still a second child in the early years. It is estimated that this trip is only a duty to pass the microphone, and it is impossible to make a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you can pass the message back to the Duke of Calvin. Before he replies, you can stay in the Winter City without a visit. - I think you will like it here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the fact that the second son is sent has the meaning of sincerity, Roland does not intend to waste this. Sincerity, we will deduct it for the time being, as a guarantee to prevent the other side from taking risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that the talks would come to an end, but did not expect Cole to make another request. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His, can I visit your territory to make paddle boats and steam engines?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a novel request, Roland looked at him with interest. "Are you interested in this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I am in Wangdu I heard that this strange ship came to the West and found it everywhere. I was very curious about how the ship did not rely on the sails." Cole stroked the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out," he nodded with a smile. "I will let Barov's supervisor arrange it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the Northern Messenger, Roland returned to the office, ready to complete the design in his hand, and suddenly heard the rush outside the window. The percussion. He looked back and saw two unexpected figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning is on the edge of the window, and McMug is licking the glass above her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s heart suddenly became tight, and this is the third day, the paddle steamer should not come back so soon, is it an accident? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you come back first?" He opened the floor-to-ceiling window and hurriedly asked, "What about other people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty! We caught the devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Anna, the leaves and the nightingale were all hurt!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good problem is not big!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it’s still very painful! You can let Miss Nanava follow Let's go for a trip?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the two people scrambling to finish, Roland felt that his heart was like a roller coaster ride, he took a breath," Really no problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going to call someone Nana Wah took it," he turned and walked outside the room. "The next time I remember something I have to say it all at once!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next evening, two paddle steamers finally appeared in the west of Chishui River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the masses from seeing the devil causing panic, the First Army left-behind troops have cleared the No. 22 Trestle and prepared a canopy. In the back garden of the castle, a temporary wooden house was set up as a laboratory. The research on the devil and the seal will be carried out under the supervision of the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Anna and the nightingale walked down the trestle, Roland completely let go of his heart, from the departure to the return but only four days, but it did not seem like a few months later. . Especially after hearing the news that the two were injured, the time passed slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This task has worked hard," he raised his mouth and opened his arms to Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter did not answer, but rushed into his arms and forced him to a strong one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale sighed. "You said that it is good for us to wait for our castle...the pier is not safe, sire."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
