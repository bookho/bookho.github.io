			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week passed quickly and the investigation team arrived at the moment of departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland called Barov, Carter and Iron Axe to the castle, telling them that they would leave the town for two days, and the affairs of Bianbu Town were fixed according to the usual time. Plans and regulations continue to be implemented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these words were unanimously opposed by the three people. Carter hopes that he can perform the duties of the chief knight, guarding the prince; the iron axe asks for a The team of 100 people was guarded; Barov used the decree issued by the town hall to persuade him to stay in the castle after the lord reviewed the stamp. In the end, he had to take out the lord's shelf and ask everyone to act according to their own orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I don't understand, what is important in such a situation, so that you can't go in person?" Barov wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is about the survival of the West...and even the Grey Castle Kingdom," Roland said for a moment, "and only I can make the best judgment." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't... Tell us the specific reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet But you will know someday." He shook his head. "In addition, this trip is a confidential operation. You must not disclose the information to anyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp More than two hundred kilometers away from the west, the devil's base camp may be stationed, and these devils have also destroyed the holy city of Takira, driving the resistance to the edge of the mainland, and turning the wild land into no one dare to step on foot. The forbidden land, it is too horrible to say this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am okay, and the various movies of the world are much more numb, but for them, I am afraid I cannot accept such a fact. Once the news leaks, it is even more troublesome. If it causes panic among the people, it may lead to a large number of people fleeing the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now is not the right time to announce the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion of the political affairs, Roland and the witch took a hot air balloon and took off from the vestibule of the castle and flew in the direction of the snow-capped mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, if it is true that the church is defending against the devil more than four hundred years ago, are they good or bad?" Ever since I learned about the existence of the devil, Sylvie has always seemed to be very worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is bad," Roland has not yet opened, and the nightingale has rushed first. "You have seen people with kindness who will kill witches for no reason." If we are really the devil's minions, but the sisters know that the witch has nothing to do with the devil, and the demon corpse is even more nonsense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;And the other party is still staring at Roland, seems to want to hear his answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter thought for a while, "First of all, whether the church is fighting against the devil remains to be confirmed. If they have made such a big sacrifice, why should they hide the news? And destroy all past records? It is the best way to expand believers by arguing about this matter. This question may only be known after finding more clues. In addition, good and bad cannot be so easily distinguished. It depends on which side you are standing on.” Roland smiled when he said it, “You actually want to ask, will I stand in the church to fight the devil, right?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." Hillvi opened his mouth, but did not deny it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teaching power and royal power itself are incompatible, even without a witch, I will not stand on the side of the church," he said, "not to mention, now I There are more people around you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will say it," the night smirk smiled. "Even if the church used to fight the devil before, they also lost, or The kind of fiasco. If it is His Royal Highness, I don’t know who wins and who wins. Why do you want to rely on the loser?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...I understand,” She nodded lightly, and the color of her eyebrows seemed to fade away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, when the evening falls, the group can already see the outline of the snow-capped mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really huge, and Roland thought that even he himself rarely saw such awkward peaks. There is no mountain range around it, just like the earth suddenly jumps here without warning, leaving a road to heaven. The gray mountain wall occupies more than half of the field of vision. I want to spend a few months from the foot of the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
