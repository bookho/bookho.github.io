			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fjord waters, sleeping islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the last house rose, the skyline had become dim. Although I can't see the sunset, the afterglow of the clouds still leaves a golden light on the sea. If it is not a cold wind blowing in the face, this scene does not seem to differ much from autumn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, this is done." The lotus lifted the scarf on the neck so that the ears could be wrapped in soft cotton wool. "Next Just put the furniture and the bed in and you can stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Masterpiece!" Dulat. Kim must pat the palm of his hand, "only for half a month I have built so many houses in time, and I thought that Tilly was only exaggerating at first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tilly adults never lie." One sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," he touched the thick double chin. "In this way, I can safely relocate the people. Um? What is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businessman from the Crescent Moon Bay curiously fumbled through the sloping, low-walled wall in the room, and bent down to look inside and behind. I looked at it a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the warmth thing I learned in the West, called the fire." Lotus explained, "It is connected to the stove, as long as the fire rises over there." The pits will also become very warm. When you put a layer of wood on it, put on linen or wheat straw, whether it is a bench or a bed, it is much more comfortable than ordinary furniture - especially in winter. So."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Interesting design," Durat looked at Lotus. "If you hired you for a long time, how many golden dragons do you need?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...What do you mean?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going to the Crescent Bay work, there are still a few wild beaches in my territory that have not been developed. Your ability is such a great helper." Say, "How many gold dragons do you need to pay for the "Sleeping Curse", will Tiley adults promise you to follow me? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I didn't think about leaving-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where, you can I lived a much better life than this," Dulat interrupted. "You can live in the same courtyard with me. You can enjoy the wine and the game from the four kingdoms every day. You can go anywhere. Attendant companionship - that is the day many people long for, as long as you work for me, this is not a problem. Besides, Didn't Tilly say that the "Sleeping Curse" is responsive, and I can afford to pay more. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lian's brow wrinkled, this attitude is not strange, she said that it is employment, but in fact it is not much different from buying himself. When she wanted to yell at two sentences, she and her hand gently touched her hand. "There is no answer to a certain response. Some witches can't do it, and another point of reaching a contract is that the parties must agree." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean that I can't pay for it?" I have never seen this business," Dural said. "Do you want to tease us when you open the "Sleeping Curse"? Sooner or later, no one will care. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not necessarily," suddenly someone behind the scene said, "Whether it is a fjord or a four-dominant kingdom, a rewarding guild composed of witches is only one case." You will come to someone if you don’t come to visit. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are again--" The businessman turned his head and couldn't help but see, "Thunder, Thunder!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "I have a mind when formulating the charter," the contractor’s approval is based on the risks that may exist in the mission. I can’t force them to go to the mountains, but the thunder laughed. “Do you think there is a problem? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...this is very reasonable," Dulat's look quickly returned to normal. "That... I have to trouble you in the future," Miss. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call," Lian looked at the back of the businessman and his group left a sigh of relief, "Thank you." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
