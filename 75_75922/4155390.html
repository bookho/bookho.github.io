			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mainland spine airspace, the god of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Heaven passes under the tower and strides into the remodeling cave at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before being officially crowned with the name of the gods, this city was once one of the most famous cities in the Blackrock Field, and its history is close to a thousand years. It has visited this place more than once, and the complicated cave structure does not cause any trouble to it. The only thing that irritates it is the masked monarch, Nasopelle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, my Lord is conducting a crucial test. Do you have a pass with the master beforehand?" At the gate of the test site, a first rise The body stopped in front of Heikezod. As a masked attendant, it apparently chose the same path as the Maharajah that he served. The two heads were forcibly connected by the magic stone device, which looked both deformed and ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way!" Heikezod didn't want to talk nonsense with him. He raised his hand and knocked the attendant over to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a combat-type ascendant, it may have to spend a little thought, but the mask is quite thorough on the road of transformation, the magic stone of the body Most of them are not suitable for combat, and the ability of the ascendant to follow it can naturally be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably aware of the repressed anger of the Scorpio Lord, the servant closed his mouth with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod pushed the heavy stone door and walked into the test site without heading back - it did not unfold the twisted door and stepped into the mask Directly with the front, it is already the greatest respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an extremely empty cave behind the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tens of thousands of glowing magic stones are scattered in the top of the rock, like the night sky full of stars. At the foot are dense inferior bodies - they are more numerous than the magic stone, most of them are worm-like, and are kept in the fence like livestock, receiving repeated stimulation of the magic core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod couldn’t help but frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in inferior bodies, they are the most useless ones. Without hands and feet means that they can't work, and extremely low intelligence is difficult to achieve. However, the unexpected discovery of the carrier test is probably due to the fact that the meridians are extremely primitive and simple, and they have the highest success rate when they are combined with foreign bodies, and are ideal parasites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not every worm inferior body can live to resonate with the "growth god", and the dead will be the feed of the next inferior body, and succeeded. Adapting to the symbiotic state can become a qualified weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Scorpio will naturally not sympathize with these incompetent incompetent people, and now they can at least contribute to the community compared to the previous ones. It is dissatisfied with the twisted taste of the mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transformation process can be placed in a closed cave, but the other party deliberately set it in the most striking area - four high-hanging suspension bridges from four The direction is over the heads of tens of thousands of inferior bodies, connected to the stout pillars in the center of the cave. Whenever you want to enter the center of the test site, you have to be forced to "appreciate" the other's favorite works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inferior body tumbling body, squeaking when suffering pain, scent of excrement, and corrupted skin of various failed works, making the entire cave smoldering . No normal family can enjoy staying in such a dark and negative place. The mask will place the laboratory on a stone pillar. Heikezod even suspects that its brain has already undergone some kind of fusion process. Damage will become more and more unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the suspension bridge, it found Nasopelle in the top floor renovation room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the sight in front of you, the Lord of Scorpio suddenly feels mad at him, only to see the masked mammoth being around the iron bird wreckage that was dragged back from it. There are several human aristocrats who live and die, and the only one who is still alive is caught in the hands of the other party. The face has been extremely frightened and the obvious wet marks can be seen on the robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nasopelle!" it shouted. "Who allows you to automate the people I bring? Even if you want to experiment, you should pass me." The permission is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s no wonder that it is furious and has painstakingly transferred land-migrating people to the Great Rift Valley and sent them to God of God. In order to prevent the Grey Fortress from expanding the war potential, it can also supplement the labor efforts in the city. It can be said that it is a multi-pronged strategy. Unexpectedly, I just thought that with a group of human beings returning to the god of God, there was a worried winter aristocrat who came to the door and said that several companions were taken away by the guards, and the whereabouts are still unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Heckzod most unhappy is that it is only a matter of grasping the civilians to do the experiment. The other side is the aristocrats. The latter is the key to controlling the people at the bottom. If there is no call and appeal from the nobility, it is intended to indicate These tens of thousands of people will inevitably have several times more energy and time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hecksod adults...help me!" The living nobles shouted as they saw the savior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah... it turned out to be the Lord of Scorpio." The mask turned back and didn’t think it was. "I have to say that this is a misunderstanding. I really like the fusion essence, but that doesn't include bugs - their best part, I have already got it six hundred years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other took off a mask on his head, revealing the face of the human female below - that should belong to a witch, but now it has become a part of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than a dozen masks, and it is conceivable that if they are all removed, it will be a look of horror. According to Nasopelle, the brain is the spirit of wisdom, more important than any part of the body, and the more heads you have, the more efficient your thinking. Therefore, the characteristics of a strong race should have at least two heads, so that you can consider the problem while taking a break while maximizing the use of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in Hecksold’s eyes, only the ugly evil beasts and the heavenly sea monsters will grow into this appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A micro-invisible purple light flashed, the mask in the face of the mask was instantly split into two halves, and then a blood line slowly opened in the female face. Blue blood smashed out of the crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably did not expect Heckzod to actually start, Nasopelle’s momentum suddenly fell, it left the aristocrats in their hands, squatting The injured face suddenly quits and takes a few steps. "You, are you crazy, are you mad? Are you going to be a priest for a prince? Don't forget that I am the creator of the god of God, and that the community wins the gods. The hope of the war is hard to come by - do you want to betray the king?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the other side’s panic, Heckzod’s heart was filled with a hint of pleasure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming the commander of the Western Front, it did not encounter a sorrowful thing, the nightmare of the monarch is inexplicably lost, the army has always been unable to break through the human defense, now even I have worked hard to win the battle for the ethnic group, but I have to be stalked from behind by the mask. It is just that! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasperelle cannot be unaware that these human beings are carrying the gods of God, and they are arrogant without their permission. This is undoubtedly blatant. Offense - can only be said that under a series of defeats, Heikzod was underestimated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is neither the king’s ruler, the masked monarch is not a demon. If you don’t give the other person’s color, I’m afraid it’s really Good to send. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it important to emphasize the advantages of the brain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of disparity in power gaps, no amount of brains will help. It wants to make the other party clear, who is the commander of the Western Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are loyal to the king, you should understand what to do and what should not be done." Heckzod removes the distortion of the blade. The door, whispered, "These people are useful to me and to the ethnic group. I hope you can understand this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Maharaja After watching the moment, the mask was taken first and softened. "I am negligent... I will ask your opinion next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So. Hecksod nodded. It is also not intended to force the other side too much - after all, the god of God does need to be controlled by several promoters who are familiar with the core of the magic, and they are basically the hands of Naso Pelle; at the same time, the symbiotic weapons necessary for the war still need The other party is making it, it can't really make a fake face, otherwise the king can't spare it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big, adults...hey, it’s great to see you..." The nobles climbed to the side of the Scorpio, tightly Hug its thighs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This will be said later," Heckzod glanced at him and then looked at the mask. "Since it is not for integration, then you put humans." What is it for here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
