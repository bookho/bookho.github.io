			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky was so bright, Kakusim came to the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike weekdays, the docks are full of silent people, carrying backpacks and rifles, like a jungle standing in the snow. Despite the large number of people, the order at the scene was very orderly. The soldiers were squatting on a paddle steamer. It was this posture that made him feel the power of speechlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kakussim could not help but swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the warrior of His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s incredible, the old man thought, when he was young, he had spent more than half of the gray fort, from Haifeng County to Bishui Port, and led the merchant fleet to the gorge. Bay Island, witnessed the armored knights of Yaowu Yangwei, also saw the fierce barbarians who can kill the beasts with empty hands. Those people are undoubtedly extremely powerful brave fighters for him, but he did not expect that now in front of a group of ordinary people, they once again feel this powerful, and better than ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, these people are ordinary people... Kakusim has been in Bianzi Town for almost four months, and the understanding of the town is deepening. He knew that the members of the First Army were basically selected from the local aborigines. When they joined the army, most of them were adults. The previous occupations were varied, including miners, hunters, kiln workers and masonry, but there were no soldiers. In other words, they did not experience combat training from an early age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in just a few months, these people already have the momentum that is no less than any of the Knights. What kind of magic is the prince’s Royal Highness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...do you really want to go?" There was a deliberately low voice coming from behind, and he was also infected by this silent team. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why should I apply for the captain?" Kakusim took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they are going to fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are all working for their Highness," The old man said back without saying, "And me too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound behind is silent for a moment, "Don't die outside."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not answer, but waved his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the snow falling, Kakusim boarded the sixth According to tradition, the captain can name his own ship. Although this eccentric ship belongs to His Royal Highness, he is still told that he has this power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the old man has not made up his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his position as the captain again after he bid farewell to the voyage for more than ten years. He hopes that he can come up with a memorable name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, you are coming!" Entering the cabin of the bow, his deputy immediately greeted him. "Now the boiler is warming up, I promise it is very fast." I can turn it up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young man is called a barracuda, from the South, and has had several years of fishing experience. If he is in other fleets, he may not even be a sailor, but it is not bad here, everyone is a novice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the crew all arrived?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s already here, you are the last one ," the other party squeezed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't know how to respect a captain, I will be happy to let you wipe the deck for a whole day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, dear Mr. Captain," the young man stood up straight, "I certainly understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is Like," Kakussim touched his beard. "Notify the boiler room and let them burn the fire a little more, but don't close the damn steam valve. I don't want to hit the butt of the front boat again. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This kid," Kakussim smiled and shook his head. The serious atmosphere brought by the First Army was diluted a lot, and he seemed to return to the days of sailing on the sea. Walking to the steering wheel, the old man gently rubbed the wooden handle and began to sink to review the operation process of the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone boat invented by His Royal Highness is very different from the sailboat. It has no masts and no cabins under the deck. There are only two places in the middle of the bow and the hull. The room, the front is called the cab, and you can clearly see the route through the two large windows. The middle is the boiler room, where the power of the ship comes from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rear and rear of the cab are bare decks. When training, they often bring some miners along the west bank of the Chishui River to hide the edge of the forest. The area digs some coal back - this thing is more resistant to fire than wood, and it is also a common heating item in Haifeng County. Now, the windshield has been pulled around the deck, and a shed has been set up on the top of the deck, apparently for the boat soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have never been exposed to this new gadget before, Kakusim soon found out in training that it is not difficult to make it move, even It is much easier than sailing. It is not necessary to adjust the canvas according to the wind direction and wind power, which saves a lot of manpower and time - just a villager can burn the boiler well, but it is impossible to master the climbing of the sails for half a year. thing. As long as the chimney emits white gas, the boat will go off when the valve is closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a dull whistle came from the front, breaking the quietness of the morning town of Bianbu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the signal for departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, the water in the stove has already boiled!" The barracuda returned to the cab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"La Bell, inform the bigfoot and the Grizzlies to close, speed, advance one!" Kakusim solemnly stated the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, advance one!" The barracuda pulls a slender wire on the wall, along which the corresponding bell in the boiler room will be sent. Trembling to convey the order from the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hull slammed a bit, and the wooden wheels on both sides slowly turned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kakusim held the steering wheel and looked straight ahead - when Wei Wei asked the question, he did not say the real thoughts, or To play for the Lord is only a small part of the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is more just a matter of "the captain". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is a sailboat or a steam paddle boat, Kakusim will feel heartfelt when he holds the steering wheel and slams the waves on the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the life he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sailing...not right, continue to add coal!" The old man turned to the right and shouted, "The boys are grabbing, we are leaving!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "As long as you can send me to Bianbu Town, the Celtic family will have a lot of rewards... Five, no, ten Golden Dragons," said the housekeeper at the door of a log cabin next to the river, facing the dilemma. The boatman asked. His left foot stuck in the door seam, lest the other party directly close the dilapidated door panel and shut himself out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big, adults...not that I don't want to send you, but I can't do it," said the boatman stuttering. "You, you." Look, my boat has a light bottom, not even a snow-blocking shed. It is usually used to cross the river, but you can go to Bianbu Town, but it’s been a few days! Don’t say that I can use poles. Can't get there, snow and snow at night, where do we sleep and sleep? You have to say that you can't freeze into two popsicles all night long?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is there any other boatman in the vicinity who can go to Bianbu Town?" The housekeeper asked unwillingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing is gone," the other party waved again and again. "We are all just small boats. Only the fortresses and the fortresses have the big sailing boats that can stay overnight. You still Go there and find it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can enter the long song fortress, why bother to come to the outskirts of the dock to find these boatmen who want to fish and ferry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
