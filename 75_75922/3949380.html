			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the determination was made, the first question he faced was: Did he personally go to Wangdu? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time that the first army of Bianbu Town has been away from the West. Unlike the two defensive wars, it will inevitably encounter the strange geographical environment. Without a pre-set battlefield, it is still unclear whether they can exert a certain amount of combat power. It is hard to be assured that they will not be able to reassure themselves. Although Roland’s military level is extremely limited, the understanding of hot weapons is considered to be the top level of the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once you leave the town of Bianbu, the West has become an uncontrolled place. If the news is passed to the Long Song Fortress, the major families will not be allowed to move. What awkward idea. As long as someone reveals this news to Tefko, both front and back will suffer. Several witches may not care so much, but if they know that they are near Wangdu, he will not mobilize the army to encircle the covenant. It is a strange thing. In terms of retreating 10,000 steps, he even let himself go, ordering other men to go straight to the west from the north, and he is also nowhere to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, the backyard fire is much more serious than the frontline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Roland decided to stay in Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the main task of the First Army is to protect the witch, and the second is to guide the fugitives to board the ship in batches instead of the trial of the King City patrol or church of Tifco. The army began a frontal battle. As long as the rescue measures are carried out properly, they will probably not open without a surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he must develop a rescue plan that is as complete as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon that day, Roland called Carter, Iron Axe, Brian and the Witch Alliance members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The landform near Wangcheng only had a sly impression in the memory of the Four Princes, but the problem was not big, he let Soroya in the living room table Draw a simple map and begin to explain the order to the Iron Axe and Brian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This central square represents the king, and this blue line represents the canal." Roland said as he thought, "You have two missions, first. It is to protect the witches from healing the fugitives and bring them back to Bianbu Town. The second is to stop the spread of the evil epidemic from spreading in the city. First of all, I will reveal to you that the disease is probably caused by the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"? Brian dared to widen his eyes, but Carter frowned, only the expression of the iron axe did not change at all - as the worship of the three gods The Mojin sand people, who did not have any awe of the church and its only true God, made Roland very gratified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The church annexed the kingdom of the winter and then launched an attack on the wolf heart. If the wolf heart is destroyed, I think that the morning and the gray castle will be their next goal. In fact, the squad is itself doubtful.” The prince said that the church also gave Tiefko, Garcia and his own meatballs. “From this point, it can be seen that he is not supporting it. An heir, but is encouraging us to kill each other. The people who swallow the pills will not become soldiers who have fought wars, but will die all over the body after the drug is broken. This is also the case with the disease. They have just spread the epidemic, and the church has declared that they have the medicine. Ironically, they have not been released to the city people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The light of hell is the most dazzling," the iron axe said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the case. To play a savior, you must take the shot at the most difficult time of the people. The stronger the contrast, the impression the church gives. The deeper the innocent people who died in the middle, but the sacrifices that are not religious enough,” Roland stated. “So in addition to saving the people from the east, we must try to destroy the church’s conspiracy.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should we do?" Brian took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hide yourself as much as possible and complete the task without the other person's awareness." Roland pointed to a large open space in the south of the outskirts of the canal. "This should be all The cropland is very suitable for lurking. You should look for a high point here and set up a scout that overlooks the dock. The soldiers responsible for the match are dressed as caravans and will treat the well-treated fugants on board. I will contact you. Merchant Margaret, let her get as many sailboats as possible, instead of just two fleets to participate in the transportation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
