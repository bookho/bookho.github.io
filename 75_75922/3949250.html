			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight sprinkled from the window between the corridors, illuminating the woman’s half of her face, her eyes reflecting a faint blue light, like a star in the dark. Anna's body leaned against the threshold, most of it fell into the shadows, but the outline was still faintly visible - good nutritional supplements made her completely thin and thin like the original, as a young woman, her figure Just right, it contains the unique youthful charm of this age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put on a calm look, slowly stepped forward, the other side also saw him, standing straight, facing him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was just an accident, I don't know she would --" he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The other party is still small, I didn't care at all -" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unlike Roland’s expectations, Anna is not like There was no disappointment on her face, but a look of seriousness. There was no ripple in her lake blue eyes, and Roland realized that the other woman was still the straight woman, she did not like camouflage, and did not need disguise. Sure enough, she took the initiative to say: "I can't dare to do such a bold act in front of everyone like lightning, so I have to wait for you here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After saying this, her cheeks clearly saw a faint blush, but even so, she did not retreat, her eyes still look directly at Roland, and her expression is extremely serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s heart beats two beats, he wants to say something, but at the moment all words are superfluous. She may mind the move of lightning, but the grievances or complaints are not the way she acts, she will only express her own requirements straightforwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children who are working hard should not be rejected, he thought. Bending down, Roland put his cheek close to Anna, and the other's breath blew slightly, like a spring breeze. Slightly nervous breathing was clearly audible in the silent aisle, and then a soft lip was lightly printed on Roland's cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good night, Your Highness." Anna whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Wendy leaned on the bed and looked at the books in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a rare leisure time for her, and she can’t think of life when she helps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not long before she came to the town, she developed the habit of cleaning her body before going to bed, wearing a silk robe, not wearing a waist. Don't buckle, sit cross-legged in the bed, put a soft pillow behind your waist, read the books borrowed from His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a lot of time to set up the lightning today, so she didn’t plan to go back to the back garden and went straight to the bed after washing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a history book about the origin of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she grew up in a monastery, she doesn’t know much about it. The nuns repeatedly warned them to obey the teachings of God, but never mentioned the name of God - this made her childhood confused, everyone has a name, why is the noblest god instead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumors recorded in the book are basically the same as the rumors she heard later. There were three churches on the mainland at first, and they believed that the other side was a heresy and believed in evil spirits. This battle of faith lasted for nearly a hundred years. In the end, the current church has won a great victory and declared that the evil spirit has been eliminated. In the future, God has only one name, the word itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the text describes the glory and immortality of the church, including the establishment of the Old Holy City and the New Holy City, and the victory of the evil witch. This made Wendy feel very strange. She once read "The History of Grey Fortress" and "A Brief History of the Mainland" under His Royal Highness. The first book recorded the establishment, development and major events of the kingdom almost without any detail. For example, the name of each king, the marital status, and the whereabouts of the children. The family branch recorded in the character article is like a detailed genealogy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
