			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Roland sat down, all the talents were seated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that remote town to the rapidly expanding core city, he has become the flag of everyone - in the eyes of the participants, Roland is clear I feel this. When speaking in the primary school desk in the past, or explaining the plan to Party A, they are not only listening, but also preparing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Prepare to execute each of his subsequent intents and orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the team that he has accumulated after three years in the world, thinking of the lonely figure in the castle and the fall and laughter of the local nobles. Look, he felt a heartfelt satisfaction in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Roland went straight to the topic, "No winter city must not let the devil take root in the fertile plains, especially in places so close to the border - although The enemy came a little early, but our footsteps have not slowed down. The gray castles have been basically calmed down. We can free ourselves to concentrate on dealing with them." He paused and looked around, saying in a word, " Driving the devil out of the ruins of Taqila is the next goal to go all out. Do you have any questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow, squat!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people have the same voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Barov, who is most concerned about the movement, did not raise any objection - the rapid development of no winter city is based on a stable order and the confidence of the people. In the city, a city that is blessed by a powerful king, a territory that has never been attacked by war, these are the main factors that attract the people to vote. If the devil is based on Taqila, it will continue to harass no winter, cause panic to the people and even cause flee, and the subsequent development will be impossible to talk about. The East and South are ruined by the continuous war of king wars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next step is to talk about specific programs, and all departments have ideas to speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Your Majesty, I think the most important thing is to move the industry in the north as soon as possible," Barov first got up and said, "If the devil invades the West, the first people to be affected are those who are not protected by the city walls. Even new After the construction of the city wall is completed, the stocking of cattle and sheep will also interfere with your military arrangement. The previous citywide warning is an example.” Here he took Wendy’s eyes and said, “Because the gate is closed, the wheat seeds and various forests are caused. The transportation of resources was blocked, but it was only under the full operation of the City Hall that the impact was reduced to a minimum."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident has been known from the letter, see the boss He said that he couldn't help but look at Wendy and found that the latter was peaceful and there was no point of arguing. Obviously, the phrase "I take full responsibility" is not a slogan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The collection of wheat, mushrooms and other resources can be transported into the city from the west side of the Chishui River via paddle steamers, but the northern slope mines cannot be moved, the kiln area The cost of reconstruction is too great, so it cannot be generalized." He thought about the moment of making a film. "These places will strengthen the defensive, so there is resistance in the encounter with the beasts. In addition, I did not elaborate on the warning, and now I am clear again. Evacuation during martial law only targets people who are still in the streets, markets, etc., not all residents. From today, I ask that no matter what happens, the factory will not stop working until I issue new orders." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... I count the industries that can be moved and hand it over to you." Probably realizing that Roland didn't want to hold him accountable, Barov immediately changed his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By the way, the new land is also planned," Roland knocked on the map behind him. "The threat in the snowy mountains has been ruled out. This area can be used in the west." Get up - as long as the leaves are in, the hidden forest is the natural barrier of the left wing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the map, the dense hidden forest is like an inverted triangle, occupying a small half A wild land. Its apex is located in the snowy mountains of the west, one side spreads north along the foot of the mountain, pointing to the Longji Mountains, and the other is accompanied by the Chishui River until there is no winter city border - these two ends are connected to form a large buffer zone. . To put it simply, if the wild land is cut into three parts, the leftmost one is the forest area, and the right one corresponds to the winterless grassland and the desolate mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area that the leaf now controls covers the entire western section of the Chishui River, so whether it is transporting coal or forest resources, the safety of the cement fleet can be guaranteed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
