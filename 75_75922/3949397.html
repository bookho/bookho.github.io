			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the office, Roland immediately began the drawing of new machinery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days when the First Army and the Witches went to the kingdom, he was not doing nothing. On the contrary, Roland felt that he was more busy than ever. Even if the nightingale is not around, there is very little time for Anna to be alone. In addition to arranging a fugitive from a ship, he asked Anna to work with Lucia to test the composition of the smelt and build a new smelting furnace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, whether it was ironmaking or steelmaking, it was purely based on experience and feelings. I didn’t know what ingredients were contained in the refining. Now I got help from Lucia. Roland finally has a way to accurately measure the composition of the ingot. By means of the ability of material decomposition, he can obtain detailed data for smelting through repeated comparisons, such as the stirring time after melting, the specific amount of charcoal added, and whether or not to add sulfur and other additives to remove sulfur and phosphorus, or to incorporate other Metal raw materials to obtain alloys, etc....<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on these data, Roland can summarize the standardization process of the smelting industry and obtain the same quality in multiple productions. Iron ingots or steel, but also a little bit of material technology fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new smelting furnace was built for this purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a square furnace with a length of four meters and a height of two meters. The bottom is inclined to one end. The thick outer shell is cast iron, the inner layer is covered with clay bricks, and Soroya's "soil" coating provides excellent heat resistance. The lowest end has a movable gate that is towed by a steam engine. Considering the high heating methods, such as oxygen blowing, arcing, etc., there is no implementation condition, the furnace is simply not equipped with any burning device - it relies entirely on Anna's black fire to smelt molten steel. After adding the raw materials according to the tested ratio and smelting, the molten steel is directly discharged from the tail gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The furnace can produce about 50 tons of molten steel at a time, and Anna can complete the smelting in just a quarter of an hour, plus the feeding and tapping time. But only half an hour or so, the output can basically meet the current production of firearms and artillery. Now the town's smelting mode is that the blast furnace and shaft furnace of the kiln group are responsible for producing a large amount of pig iron, which can be used for the manufacture of daily iron and steam engines, or as a raw material for further smelting by iron furnace to produce wrought iron or steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design drawing that Roland is currently drawing is exactly one set for bullet stamping. Production equipment - With a stable and reliable source of steel, the processing and assembly of stamping machinery no longer has hardware difficulties, the successful trial production of mercury sulphate, and the mass production of new bullets is imminent. Although Anna's black fire cutting is efficient and accurate, it takes a long time for one person to complete the whole process. If the press line is put into production, more than 30 ordinary people can be operated after training, and at least one day can be produced. Wanfa bullets, soldiers do not need to manually reload ammunition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eating dinner, I drew it for a long time, until the midnight bell came out of the window, and the full set of sketches had a look. Of course, this is only the most preliminary conceptual design. In some details, he does not know whether it is feasible or not. It still needs to be tested before it can be finalized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is normal, Roland has long been yawning, but today he is so excited and has no sleep at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collect more than a dozen drafts of paper, take out the parchment paper attached to the five kings’ letter from the drawer, and spread it out at the table. He finally waited for the expectation. A long-term link - choose to visit the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list lists about the ability of more than 60 auxiliary witches, obtained from the mouth of the wheat, the total number of witches on the sleeping island should be two hundred to three About a hundred people, it is clear that Tilly did not list all the abilities of the auxiliary witches on the table. This is also in line with the practice of a leader - take the initiative to extend the hand of friendship, rather than tray out the bottom of the house. The other party can do this, enough to express the sincerity of willingness to form an alliance. Roland puts on a new candle and concentrates on viewing the witch's ability in the appendix. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that this is a very difficult choice to make a decision. After many comparisons, he selected a list of five visitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Roland spread a piece of parchment and began writing a letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dear sister, I am very happy to see your letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For you I feel very excited and gratified by the decision I made. With your help, I have a lot of control over the church's offense."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
