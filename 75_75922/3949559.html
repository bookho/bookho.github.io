"According to the experience of the second battle of the gods, if they want to detect human towns, The action should not be so casual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" the prince asked quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to bring the message back, such investigations usually consist of two or three teams, mostly equipped with evil beasts, and not too far apart. - At least within the scope of the spear slayer," she said slowly. "In order to annihilate these squads, the Federation often dispatched flying witches to the rear to intercept, and the front side dispatched a double-numbered sacred warrior to arrest. At the end of the war, the size of the investigation team is getting bigger and bigger, and there will even be fears and flying devils. There is no reason to come now, they will only send two unaccompanied ordinary madmen to investigate, and their dress up It’s also...something shabby.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will the devils feel that Bianbu Town does not need them to spend a lot of time to check, just send two people at random?" The ashes open the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't make sense," Aegusa thought for a moment, and finally denied it. "In the era of the federation, even if it is a small town, as long as it is At the border, there must be a witch stationed. The devil is not likely to understand the changes in the human world during these four hundred years, so the investigation should still be carried out in accordance with the arrangement of the second war of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean...they didn't deliberately investigate the town, but just happened to meet it?" Roland couldn't help but feel a loose heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most likely," she frowned, seemingly thinking about something. "The devil may not know that there are human towns built here, just to explore their own camp." The surrounding situation. The enemy that they may encounter mainly is the evil beast, so there is no carrying magic stone that cannot be used continuously—that is, the spear, but the electro-optical stone that is more convenient to attack.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait..." Roland stopped. "You said the devil's camp?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, otherwise How can they get here in a thousand miles," said Ai Gesha, of course. "Only after the establishment of a stronghold on the fertile plains, the devil can use this as a springboard to go to the wild... Oh, forget that it should be called the Big Four now. Kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, this is a big deal! The enemy photographed the base at the door of his house. How did the days go by? The prince blinked and asked, "Is it like a camp behind the snowy mountains?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost, during the war, there will be at least several storage towers in the outpost to store the red Fog, plus one or two hundred devils stationed," Ai Gesha nodded. "But considering that the Red Moon has not yet arrived, they are unlikely to build a new tower fortress in Fertile Plain. The transportation of red fog is also very inconvenient. So the size of the camp should not be large."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?" Tilly looked at Roland with some concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First find the camp - if it does exist," he paused. "And... get rid of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Decisive choice," Ashes raised his mouth and said, "This is like the decision that the lord will make. Rest assured, we will also help you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ai Gesha is right, the devil can't extend its tentacles to the entire fertile plains until the third war of gods is officially opened. Therefore, after the removal of the stronghold near the West, at least a few years of peace can be exchanged - even if the other party wants to retaliate, they can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is not without risk. The other party will at least know that there is a group of human beings in the east of the forest, and they have the ability to actively attack the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if you let the camp expand, it will only bring you more trouble. After the first group of investigators disappeared, they are likely to send more people, and the exposure of Bianbu Town is sooner or later. And as the base grows bigger and bigger, the devil will only grow more and more. When the evil moon ends, it is necessary to deal with the enemies who come to harass at any time. It is a bit worthwhile to lose - the first army was held in the town and could not move. How do you complete the planned spring offensive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the office, Roland immediately called Lightning and McMug and explained the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
