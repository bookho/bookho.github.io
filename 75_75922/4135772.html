			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord's Castle Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to Sean’s report, it’s been two hours later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, this trip can be considered very smooth, Zoe and Betty not only brought back the ancient relics, but also used the seized gods to be the warriors of Dagong Island. After looting, all kinds of jewelry were piled up in a whole cabin. At this point, the foundation of the original Hermes church was completely cut off, and no matter which wolf-hearted aristocracy occupied the island of Dagong, no connection would be made to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the companions, Kajin. Fiss immediately left the guards with his disciples and returned to the hotel with his disciples. It seems that the creation of the new script can't wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Church members Farina and Joe were taken to prison and awaiting the trial of the Grey House Security Bureau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These two will be handed over to you." Roland turned his head and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night licked his shoulder to show that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the treasures in the rumor...the ritual Rubik's Cube, is it in this lead box?" Roland looked at the gray box at the foot of Sean - according to the betrayal Hagrid's description, its size is similar to the palm of a hand, like a stone polished into a cube; considering the danger of strong radioactive material, he prepared the rescue team before departure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I personally took care of it according to your instructions, and did not touch the third party except Zoe and Miss Betty." Grace replied, "But before I put it into the lead box, I noticed an unusual sign."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What signs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, do you remember that I mentioned in my secret letter that Lorenzo decided to send Hagrid to the cage to inquire about the reason?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought for a moment, "because the treasures that have not changed in the last hundred years have emitted blue light?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly," Sean Nodded, "When Miss Zoe brought back the ritual Rubik's Cube, I said a word that I was very concerned about - she said, "The blue light above seems to be changing." So I paid more attention to my eyes and found that the light had always pointed to me, just like a compass. To be honest, I was scared at the time and almost didn't throw the Rubik's Cube to the ground. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just like listening to ghost stories. Roland also feels a hairy hair, but his face still does not change his color. "Are you finally finding out the reason?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably. "Shawn took out something from his arms and handed it to the mahogany table. "After calming down, I think that an ancient relic is unlikely to respond to an ordinary person. It must be a problem. After some investigation, I found that it was not me, but the coin. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the highly condensed uranium coin used to find the source of the mine - Aqima returned to no one after winter, it was handed over to Shawn.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the ritual cube is re-emerged because it senses uranium coins.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This It’s really a bit interesting...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pondered after a moment and said, "I know. This mission is very good, let's go to rest first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Shawn retire, the nightingale emerged from the fog and walked up to the front of the lead box to look around.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, what did you find? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a magical creation. "She is sure," although it looks like an unpolished stone, it is definitely not that simple. In the fog, I saw a light like a magical cyclone, just like the magic core in the hands of the Takira witch. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
