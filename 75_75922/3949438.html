			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conflict is coming to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the coming knights, no one dares to say more, or that most of the actors themselves are wall grasses, or there will be no initial disputes. In the face of the famous Mei Yi, not everyone has the courage to stand up and confront her. Now the situation has become one-sided, and Bella is directly taken out of the lounge by two men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short time, only the Carter and the town crew members were left in the big room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help," Gate and others have been screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are...too powerful! Two or three times forced her to say nothing," Irene exclaimed Mey’s hand and exclaimed. "There is still a slap in the face, she just beat her!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she turned to the chief knight for a ceremony, "Cartel, how come you Appeared in the Long Song Fortress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am also very curious about this problem." Mey shrugged, but his heart was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of His Royal Highness orders," Carter said, "Can I have a drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...where do you live?" The chief knight looked a little cautiously around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it’s normal," Mey took a bottle of white wine from the cupboard and poured a shallow cup for him. "The pub is only open at night, this cup is my request." Irene's guys sneaked very fast, one by one on the road and suddenly remembered something. Finally, I returned to the residence, leaving only her and Carter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, indeed...very ordinary," Carter coughed two channels, "I don't know your family..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mother died very early, I found a job for my father in the theater, it was a little chores," Mey said quietly. "But I think he will come back at night." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This small bungalow in the inner lane of the inner city is the one she bought after she became the star of the West, although the house is small and old. But moving away from the outer city can at least save her from harassment and uneasy peeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...Sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing," Mey also pours himself A small cup, "Have your Highness let you come to rectify the theater order and solve the actor dispute?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, of course not," Carter waved again and again, " Tiffco also sent people to find troubles in the West. His Royal Highness was on the way with the big troops. I just arrived by the township and arranged for the Second Army to strengthen the night watch. By the way, the honeysuckle family was vigilant and prevented. Sneak attack on the city gate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You shouldn't tell me these things," Mey groaned, then shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You asked, and it’s not a secret action," Carter drank in a drink. "Reassured, I have a measure."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," she grinned. "So how did you get to the theater?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After I explained the matter, I suddenly saw the drama propaganda that you starred in. I wanted to see what you would look like on the real theater stage. The result was as I imagined - although I only saw the end part. But your performance is really wonderful." The knight sighed. "So I went into the background and wanted to invite you to have a drink, but I didn't know if I should go in. I just slammed at the door until I heard the dispute." ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have been outside?" Mayi frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't mean to overhear," Carter raised his hands. "This is just an accident, I promise."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," she couldn't help but laugh out. "I didn't blame you, don't show such expression."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
