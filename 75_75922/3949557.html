			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explorers are never afraid of taking risks, but adventures are never reckless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devils are not terrible, they can be killed, and there are huge weaknesses - that is, you must rely on the red fog to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves used to kill the trapped devil with a bow, and the nightingale killed the enemy in extremely unfavorable circumstances, and the lightning darkened the air. She can certainly do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We should report to our Highness first," the leaf hurriedly said, "Whether it’s nightingale or ashes, dealing with the devil is much more skilled than us!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When they come here, maybe the devil has left." Lightning checks the pistol's nest, ensuring that every hole is filled with bullets, "Let's let it be so dangerous." The enemy wanders around the border, and the risk is even greater."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...can stay and stare at them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp;&nbsp;" "What if the other party walks out of your control," the little girl insisted. "If you start blocking the other, it is equivalent to exposing your own existence. It is not as good as the three of us." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves are silent and seem to be moved by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" McMug stood on the top of the lightning and patted his wings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know it," she scratched the neck of the pigeon. "We will be one by one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did she say?" asked the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning grin," she said she wants to use her claws to smash the other’s head, then use her wings to make a patties, and finally racke it to the campfire to see it. See if you can eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She clearly said only two!" The latter questioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be big." The little girl nodded in a serious position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent explorers should not only be bold, but also able to drive the entire team, let them relax when they are nervous, and let them stay alert when they relax. . Dad, what you said, I try my best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning wrists shake, close the nest, try not to expose their nervous feelings, pretend to be calm and say, "They are still here." How far?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About three hundred meters, just to our right," answered the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not a forest block, this distance is already able to see the enemy, she thinks, she undoubtedly has the advantage of pre-emptive, and the range of the pistol is not comparable to the magic stone. of. "You can trap the devil with vines, right? It's like when it's wild."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, there should be no problem in a short time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then we attack from the top of the head," Lightning decided. "This direction is the hardest to find by the enemy, and their attention is temporarily placed on the vine. As long as the battle can be ended in a short time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...understand." The shaking of the leaves is somewhat hesitant, probably in the memory of the leaves. There are too many shadows left. However, lightning can't take care of this at the moment, and then delay, the courage that I can hardly spurt will disappear. After all, it is her and Mai Hao. The leaves are completely hidden in the forest, no matter how the devil attacks the vines, it will not hurt her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So start!" Lightning vacated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" The pigeons followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest instantly became a green and white color block at the foot. The little girl pulled down the windshield sent by her highness and felt the courage in her heart a little more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are there," searched for a long time, the wheat scorpion that turned into a gray-tailed eagle found the target - under the gaze of the eagle eye, even The rabbit running in the snow can't escape her tracking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
