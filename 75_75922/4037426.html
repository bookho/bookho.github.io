			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You lost weight..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Roland stroked Her cheeks whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna’s eyes are still as pure as the lake, and despite the waves, the blue eyes still clearly reflect his figure. It’s just that the girl’s body is obviously much thinner. Through the clothes, I can feel the slightly raised spine behind her, the clavicle under the neck is highlighted, and the face is not rounded in memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am worried." Sniffing the fragrance that she exuded, Roland’s heart was filled with long-lost calm. It is only a matter of blinking, but it seems to be separated by centuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna shook her head and rubbed the tears in her eyelids on the collar of Roland. "You just woke up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How long have I been in a coma? Three days... One week?" But seeing Anna look like this, he is somewhat uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland lived, "What?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, it’s a month and twenty-two days," looking at his sluggish expression, Anna couldn’t help but burst into laughter. "It’s autumn now, you didn’t find it. Have you changed your curtains?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was actually unconscious for almost two months? He did not dare to move his lower arm and whispered his toes, without any oysters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I am...how to eat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have not eaten, Anna leaned on his shoulder, clutching his clothes tightly with his hands, as if he was afraid that he would sleep again. "Someone took it for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃... can this be replaced?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the ability of the bloody witch to be a sorcerer, she planted a symbiotic species in you, usually just eat more Just one serving of food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can still be used like this! Roland’s heart is secretly amazed. This symbiotic relationship is obviously not just about sustaining life. From the point of view that the muscles of the hands and feet are not shrinking, it is equivalent to completely connecting the two living bodies and sharing a circulatory system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed a bit and looked sideways at the tub on the floor. "These days, you are taking care of me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, after a long period of slumbering, the body is still dry and clean, and it must be that someone cleans his body and changes his clothes. This is a cumbersome process. To be done day after day, patience and love are essential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is nothing compared to what you do," Anna whispered. "You have fulfilled your promise to the witch and defeated the army of the church." Now, in the entire Witch Alliance, every sister is willing to give everything for you. Even without me, someone will take care of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I I hope that you will come," Roland looked at her and bowed her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the two talents were reluctantly separated, and Anna’s cheeks floated with a touch of red glow. “Right, I have to tell others quickly, they are I hope that this day has been a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you continue?" Roland smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She unconsciously turned her head. "You just woke up, you should take care of it for a while..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I feel that I am all in strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That doesn't work," Anna raised her hand and hammered him a few punches, then turned back. Start the tub and walk back and forth to the bedroom door. "I will be back soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have slept enough, rest assured." Roland smiled at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you sleep for so long? Is it related to the incredible sight seen in the dream? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has some uneasiness in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, after the dream wakes up, the content of the dream will fade quickly, and even don’t forget it all day, but until now He still remembers exactly what happened in his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eleven-year-old little girl, really is Jieluo? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would she call her uncle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the shocking appearance is not like being installed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more Roland thinks, the more he feels that there are more than one or two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city in the dream is definitely not the place where he lived in his previous life. The school that appears on TV is the most powerful proof - the university should be based on the mountain. Built, part of the scenic area, high-rise buildings are not allowed to be built around the entire school district, but in the background picture of the news broadcast, you can see the gray skyline formed by the skyscraper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apartment building is also very problematic. From the side-by-side households and walkways, this is the oldest style of the building, usually built in the 70s and 80s. It is incompatible with the bustling streets hundreds of meters away and the tall buildings farther away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dark green security door, the old desk fan and the wall-mounted color TV are equally weird, if not the owner’s special hobby, almost no one This will decorate your living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything seems to be real, and it’s actually full of loopholes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase "I will never let you go" in front of Hysteria before the dissipating of Jieluo is a curse or a threat? Does she expect to create such a poor dream to confuse him? If you just let him do a few nightmares, it would be too bluffing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Roland meditated, there was a buzzing sound outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of witches rushed into the bedroom and surrounded him. Under the eyes of the public, Roland also got a little upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough... In short, I’m fine, these days...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning Waiting for him to finish, flew to the big bed and grabbed his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Thank God,” Wendy’s hands clasped to her chest, and there was an uncontrollable excitement in her voice. “You finally woke up.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a troublesome guy," Lily grinned. "Let us worry for so long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You are also worried about others? That is a very rare thing," the mystery month muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where mortal, it is always more fragile than a witch." Ai Gesha took out a balanced magic stone and looked at Roland. " Um... I can't observe the magic reaction. It seems that you didn't inherit all of Jieluo. How, what do you think of? For example, as a memory of the Pope?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Roland slightly surprised to ask: "Do you know this ability?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We caught the pure prisoner of the church, inquired from her mouth ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...but I don't seem to accept her memory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait, if he is overwhelmed by the memory of more than two hundred years, now is not the former four princes?" Ashes stood out, "Who can prove that he is Roland instead of Jieluo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please, don't you mess up at this time?" Andrea gave her a look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is Roland, I am sure." The sound of the nightingale came from the other side of the big bed, and Roland was strange that she was not as usual. Presented in shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
