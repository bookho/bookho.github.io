			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night passed quickly, and Felice stayed up all night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She locked herself in the room, silently waiting for the results to be revealed, although she remained calm in her face, she made countless conjectures about the reasons for the disappearance of the chosen person. And even Roland privately imprisoned the witch as a plaything, and concealed the speculation of the truth from the Witch Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when Wendy and Ai Gesha came to the diplomatic building early the next morning, Felice showed a rare tiredness - mental loss for The soul is very burdened, and she knows that her control over the body is declining, and she has lost her flexibility in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she also knew that she couldn’t close her eyes anyway before she heard the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cutting off consciousness can only temporarily get rid of the bondage of the body, but the soul is still awake, unless it is transferred to the magic container, it is only equal to deceiving within the consciousness. On his own, Felice even faintly misses the "long sleep", "the result is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We found the light column you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect Aegis’s first sentence to shatter the burden on her heart, and Felice blinked, for fear that she had got it wrong. He whispered again, "Like a light wall?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, like a light wall, it does exist in the castle," Wendy picked up. "But we are not sure that he is the chosen person you are talking about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is, she did not hear the mistake? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found the owner of the orange light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No...not wrong," Felice felt a voice cheering in her heart, praising the gods! Praise the holy city of Tacchi! "If you can emit such a beam of light, then it must be the chosen person we are looking for! Is she a high-ranking witch? What is the name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn’t answer it immediately, but I showed a strange look—like trying to laugh, but quite helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, this is... I’m afraid to disappoint you." Wendy covered her mouth and coughed twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a problem with the colorful magic stone?" Aegusa returned the ring to her. "I think you are better off contacting Pasha." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions? What happened in the end? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc...Fillis suddenly felt a flash of lightning in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did Wendy say before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we are not sure that he is the chosen person you are talking about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairy dared not open his mouth. "Is that orange light is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"It was from the body of Roland Wimbledon," Ai Gesha said. "Not just me, Nightingale, Anna, Wendy... The witches who live on the second floor of the castle have seen it all over. I also tested it with the Balanced Magic Stone. He is as usual, without any magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The weapon you said can deal with the devil... ...The manipulator must ask for a witch?" Wendy finally couldn't help but sneer. "If you can make a hero to destroy the devil, it sounds good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairy’s heart is slamming down, and the sacred instrument does not have much demand for the magic of the chosen person, but it does not mean that it can activate it without magic. After all, it is still one. The magic core, the total amount of magic contained in the operator determines its number of uses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is impossible...Where is it wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But yesterday I didn't see an orange light on his head--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
