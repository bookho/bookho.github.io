			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey..." Hillview looked at the shells for a while, and looked at Rolandâ€™s design sketch for a long time before pointing to the detonator section. It is this nail that is not aligned with the top."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spring?" Anna asked, "Is it stuck on both sides of the iron plate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Left or right?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna asks for details and then records the questions one by one on the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After collecting the reason for the failure, it is the next round of shooting - four shots can just use Axia's playback ability, so that the improvement The efficiency has naturally become unprecedentedly high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the next two rounds of test firings also failed, and Roland had to announce that he would continue the trial tomorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Asha and Sylvie, their work today is all over, then you can go back to the castle to enjoy a delicious afternoon tea, or go to the convenience market. See if there are any novelty items. But for Anna and Ai Gesha, the grenade test is just a small part of the busy work. In particular, Anna, in addition to improving the fuze in accordance with the reasons for failure, she had to complete the development and assembly of the steam turbine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland intends to follow her to the backyard of the North Slope to see the progress of the turbine model, and the guardian Sean brought the news of the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Your next position, Los Angeles, the deputy director of the Ministry of Construction, hopes that you can go to the furnace area, he said that the first dry distillation furnace has been set up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a necessary facility for the coking plant, the ten retortes planned are located in Next to the kiln group at the foot of the northern slope mining area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the large-scale felling of bricks and iron-making, the kiln group has changed from a small plot of less than 1,000 square meters at the beginning to now along a mountain Extending the vast blank space. If it is not Roland that prohibits workers from accessing the woods near the town, it is estimated that there will not be a tree in the north of the border area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is coal, but the convenient and easy to get charcoal is still the main force of smelting iron, as the tree taking place is farther away from the kiln group, workers They set their sights on the northern slopes of the mountain - hundreds of logs were cut off every day and then dropped from the top. From a distance, a small piece of "bald spots" appeared in the green mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland naturally does not require them to protect the environment in this kind of thing, as long as the dust does not affect the town, he does not care if he cuts down the North Hill. . After all, compared to the desperate mountains, this prominent small mountain range is just a negligible corner. There are leaves to maintain the basic vegetation, and there is basically no need to worry about soil erosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flatlands that were opened at the foot of the mountain naturally became the most suitable place for the coking plant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took the nightingale and the guards through the noisy kiln area to the front of the first retort. Luo Ya immediately greeted him and bowed to him. "Your Majesty, I built this double-layer kiln with refractory bricks according to your requirements. According to the drawings, the upper furnace should be closed with iron gates, the middle mezzanine There are also iron plates that can be moved freely, but I don't know who to look for to make these two things. In addition, the copper pipes and chimneys on the small stove are also finished, except for these metal components, the rest has been completed." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland drilled into the stove and checked it all over - I have to say that as a member of the original stonemason, an old friend of Carl Vabert, Losya was in the masonry It really has a lot of experience. The inner wall of the nearly two-storey dry distillation tower is evenly changed. The gap between each brick is basically the same. The brick joints are also layered and interlaced, and there is no straight seam. It is obvious that not only the layout ability is extraordinary, but also the construction attitude is very serious. . It is important to know that even if you use the same drawing, the finished products built by different people may be very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job," he applauded after checking. "I will arrange for the iron gate and the iron plate to be cast, and then you only use it in its welcome." Cover the fire with refractory bricks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty," Losya said with hesitation. "Can you tell me how this stove works?" ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
