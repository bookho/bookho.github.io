			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence makes the 76th slightly surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that more than one reviewer? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, four hundred years of tempering has taught her how to hide her emotions, not to mention that as soon as the mind turns, the body will be separated from consciousness - It’s hard to make her face a flaw by simply asking for a blitz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventy-sixth first pretends to be surprised, then reluctantly pulls out the ring from the robes, hesitated for a long time to say, "It is I stole from... "black money." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, her evaluation of the Witch Alliance rose to another level, and began to think that their greet was too casual, and now it seems not so. The witch can identify the lie, and one has the ability to see through, which is considered to be cautious enough.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black money? "The green long-haired witch took the ring in her hand and looked at it for a while. "This... seems to be a magic stone, but it looks different." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventy-sixth heart suddenly frowned, they actually know the existence of the magic stone? This is a bit of trouble, although its activation and Ordinary magic stones are not the same, but as long as you ponder for a while, you will find its role sooner or later. You must take their attention away, she does not have a second thing.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Black money" is the underground exhibition I used to visit... There are often auctions of things that have been discovered from ancient ruins. The boss often said that they have incredible power, the more novel things, the more The more popular with buyers. In addition, they occasionally auction... auctions..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Wendy asked.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" auction witch. "Seventy-sixth whisper.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, the faces of the four people showed unadorned anger and placed on the ring. The attention is also a bit less. Obviously they all hate the fact that the witch is used as a slave to buy and sell, which also explains from the side that the witch organization of the Grey Fortress will not agree with the practice of the Star City.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing to lie on the 76th, I was almost auctioned to the nobility by "black money"," Amy echoed. "Fortunately, the ambassador saved me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will get retribution sooner or later," said the blonde witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A ring..."The seventy-sixth is loaded with a look of awkwardness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although Miss Ai Gesha will be interested in this thing, but still wait for you first I’m familiar with the winter city,” said the green-haired witch, who shrugged her shoulders and did not have what it meant to be, and put the ring back in her hands.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On the 76th, a slight glimpse, Ai Gesha? The name sounds familiar, and seems to have seen it everywhere.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promise, you "You won't encounter such a thing again," Wendy said. "No one dares to hit your idea in the winter city. Roland believes that the era when witches and ordinary people live together will soon come. - By then Not only is the gray castle west, but no one in the entire kingdom will regard you as the devil's minions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you really have one day?" "The broken sword asked half-heartedly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the Witch Alliance was established for this purpose. Wendy laughed. "In short, I will take you to the rest place first." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy-seven slowly moved to the stretcher and was carried by the sailors Out of the cabin. At the moment I left the sailboat, she finally saw the whole picture of the pier. The snow that was dancing in the sky did not let the city cool down. Dozens of people lined up along the pier, sweeping the snow on the ground. It’s a weird cargo ship that docks and unloads cargo. As Amy said, they don’t have towering masts and sails, but they can come and go freely in the river.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The boats don't seem to have paddles..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
