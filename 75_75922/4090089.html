			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prius has not heard of this name, Bianbu Town is only a place of residence established by the mine, and the word "city" is completely out of place, not to mention Also ranked third? Before you squat down to the West, you can be called a city here, and there is only a long song fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when a pedestrian enters the hole at the foot of the North Slope, he understands where the squat is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been very curious before, why the Ministry of Construction wants to build a fortress-like building in the winter city--the location of the main position guarded by the First Army is inevitable It’s too weird. It’s backed by the North Slope Mountains. There are long distances between the east and west sides of the border. It doesn’t seem to be used to defend against foreign enemies. It’s even harder to defend the castle under your arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked some of the colleagues in the city hall, the answer is not known, there are people who say that even the construction team in that place is by the Minister Carl Direct jurisdiction, others have no right to ask questions. At this point, Prius is no longer talking about it. He just mentions it casually. He doesn't want to trouble himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, he had a day to personally set foot on this military site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When seeing the underground passages that were apparently man-made, and the large group of caves, Prius was surprised to almost close without chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this dug out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a year ago, there was nothing in this place. Now it seems that the entire mountain is open to the general public. Such a wide underground space is not a city. For the past, but... is this manpower able to do it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sneaked a sneak peek at it, and the fear in his heart deepened again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Lane did pick the wrong opponent. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the lion has been in charge of the West for more than a decade, it has been trying to control the big families, and the barren borders are operating like a piece of iron, and the wrists and strength are impeccable. Yes, he is still awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the elk knight is even more shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at a flat, open hall by a trailer, the two warriors dressed up were surrounded - since the First Army popularized the musket, it has rarely been seen The guards look like they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them hit him up and down, and then turned to his knees and said, "Is this really good?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My people will know this sooner or later, instead of concealing it, it is better to accept it slowly," Roland said. "It’s good to start with the officials of the City Hall."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's okay..." The man sighed helplessly and looked up and waved at the dome. Then a black shadow descended from the sky and fell silently in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prius’s heart slammed and almost didn’t make a sound! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is on, what the hell is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the sarcoma monster with a tentacles in front of him, he feels that his back is cold, even if it is a devil from the abyss of hell, it is almost like this! The Cavaliers wanted to step back two steps, only to find that their feet were not listening. The only thing that supported him was that he did not fall immediately. Probably the King who was still calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he "listened" to a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft female voice is not in the ear, but directly in the mind, "Hello, dear, hello."<br /><br />&nbsp "Hello, Pasha," Roland smiled. "How are the bugs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The number has increased a lot. As long as the mushrooms are sufficient, they seem to be eating all the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems quite good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, you can hand it over to us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prius looked at his majesty and talked to the monster, just like talking to ordinary subjects, and the attitude displayed by the monster was quite respectful, not like the devil's aggressiveness - if the ghosts in the book are If you talk like this, it won’t be confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and finally made the heartbeat a little calmer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what does it seem like to let him raise? insect? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And... Is this the secret of the other party? At the foot of the northern slope mine, is there such a sensational inhumanity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Majesty seemed to see through his thoughts and patted him on the shoulder. "This... Ms. Pasha, once a famous lord, Although it has been cursed by the devil, it has become what it is now, but the heart is still human, you don't need to be afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lead, lord?" Prius I only came back after I squatted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," the king sighed. "Let's go and talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then He heard an incredible story. There are more than one monster like Pasha. They lived in a wild land four hundred years ago and built their own town, but they did not endanger the double invasion of the evil beast and the devil. . Most people died in the wilderness, and only a few fled to the West. The curse made them into monsters, and they never lived, and they have to live with pain. Now Roland Wimbledon has accepted this group of survivors, who are both ally against the devil and the people under the gray castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original...this is the case," Prius murmured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, you also saw that their shape is easily reminiscent of bad things, so this event can only be listed as top secret for the time being. Only a very small number of people know." Roland paused for a moment, his eyes condensed. "If you leak it, you should know the consequences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chen will definitely be tight-lipped , Your Majesty!" Prius quickly stressed. Although this episode is even more ridiculous than the horror stories in the grandmother's mouth, at this time he simply does not want to consider how much is true and how many are fake. His Majesty said what it is, this is the most basic principle of loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You understand," he nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Msarcoma monster... No, it was the ancient lord Pasha who took everyone through a long passage and said, "We are here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing in front of the Cavaliers is a huge cave, the bare underground suddenly becomes alive and kicking, not to mention the plants and underground landscapes that have never been seen before. It is a huge worm crawling up and down in the mushroom, which is enough for him to keep his eyes on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably because of the stimulation of too much time, Prius found himself not so scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...do you want me to raise something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King of the King It seems to have been paying attention to his look. At this moment, I finally nodded with satisfaction. "Yes, it is called rubber worm, which can secrete a kind of industrial material with a wide range of uses, which is no less than the poultry and meat. The expedition is deep in the snowy mountains. It was discovered, so the new species was brought back, but it could only survive in the ground, so it was temporarily held by the survivors living in the third side of the city." Speaking of this, the other party turned the topic, " I heard that you have raised a lot of food for raising chickens and ducks, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...Yes," Prius stayed up for a long time. The idea behind you, "This will narrow down their foraging areas, and the speed of poultry will grow faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is nothing to raise these bugs The difference - I am not talking about feeding methods, but the essence," Roland lifted his foot and kicked a rubber worm that crouched on the mushroom. When I fell to the ground, I got a reaction. I dragged my big belly and climbed into the depths of the grass. "They are not aggressive. The favorite food is these mushrooms. Although they are big, they are very timid. You don't have to worry that it will bite you. It is only necessary to collect the mucus in their stomachs at regular intervals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glue...Liquid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
