			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the way to the backyard of the North Slope Mountain, Roland’s ear has been echoing this sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that there is a gap in his heart that is opened a little bit, yes, he thinks that he is no longer the original cartographer who deals with mechanical drawings all day. It is not a world that is familiar to the past. He has gradually become a big lord of the leading party. He may even become the ruler of the kingdom in the future. When the situation changes, it is no longer necessary to bind himself with the previous concept. Be applicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s good to follow the innermost thoughts. He tells himself that if you force each other for some false “regulations”, there is no benefit other than hurting both sides. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Roland’s mood suddenly widened. He took a deep breath of cold air and slowly pushed open the backyard door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open iron gate is like a gap in the bottom of my heart, and a new world is opened in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah... is Your Highness," Hummingbird and Lucia ran up to the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you coming?" Anna showed a sweet smile and saw a shallow red mark on her white neck. Roland couldn’t help but think of each other. Last night's enthusiasm, but since he made the decision, he did not care about the last time waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are the models made?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," Anna did A gesture with me, the two walked out of the back door of the yard, and saw an iron boat floating in the center of a pool surrounded by snow. The iron boat is about one meter long and twenty centimeters wide. It looks much longer than the crude benzene cement ship. The bow has a distinct fusiform shape and the rear end is a flat tail. The most special is that the bottom of the ship is covered with criss-crossing support strips, which look like a myriad of squares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what I want," Roland sighed, and the pure steel boat has a unique sense of sophistication compared to the stone boat cast from reinforced concrete. Especially with the intertwined beams on the dense cloth, it is like a piece of art. He knows that each module of this ship model is completely scaled down and cut by black fire. A connection point is not omitted. If it is placed in later generations, it is also a boutique worth tens of thousands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it the new ship you want to make?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," he ordered Head, "is also the first regular warship in the town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Roland intends to still use the cement boat as the hull of the shallow-water heavy gunship, but he found that In the case of insufficient steam engine power, the speed of the cement ship has become the most significant shortcoming - in the case of only fuel and personnel, the average speed of the entire fleet of the long song fortress is only eight to nine kilometers, if the above is still To carry a rotatable 152mm cannon, plus the necessary ammunition and other combat weapons, the speed is likely to fall below the five-kilometer mark. If converted into a festival, even three speeds are not guaranteed. The reason is that the weight of the concrete is too heavy. If you use it to transport it, you don't care about speed. If you are a warship, you will naturally be lighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the steel production capacity was seriously insufficient two months ago, he could only hold his nose and recognize it, but with the Iron Star in production, Today's steel reserves have been able to support him in building a real armored warship. In terms of structure, Roland chose the simplest modular assembly type—that is, welding a piece of steel plate with transverse longitudinal beams to form a larger hollow box structure, and then splicing together many flat boxes to form a hull bottom plate. This kind of building block type shipbuilding method does not need to set the keel, and it has nothing to do with the classical method. Moreover, the enemy does not threaten his own artillery completely, so he does not need to care about the defense problem. The side is almost surrounded by thin iron sheets. , to minimize costs and weight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the power section, Roland decided to put the propeller technology on the new ship instead of the paddle drive of the cement ship... The power unit is still a steam engine to turn the gear Drive two propellers. However, in the design plan handed to Anna, he reserved the modification space of the three-up steam engine, and planned to wait until later for mass construction, and then re-converted into a new steam engine that is more suitable for ship use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the yard, Anna began cutting the first steel plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black fire is in her hands as the most accurate ruler, flying up and down, a thick piece of steel one meter square is like a potato, instantly turned into seven or eight thin plates The thickness of each steel plate is five millimeters, not more than one point and not less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
