			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unexpected surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland originally thought that she would send a few fighting witches to help out, but I did not expect to come in person, which means that the trouble on the island has been solved, or Temporarily no threat to the stability of the sleeping island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day after receiving the letter, Roland took Anna and others to welcome Tilly’s arrival in the shoal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a month of construction, there are also many traces of artificial carving on the muddy mixed beach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple wooden board houses and work sheds stand around the ramp - that is the prototype of the future warehouse and sailor's quarters, in order to prevent the erosion of the sea breeze, the windward side of the wooden house It is coated with an orange-red coating that is both eye-catching and beautiful. A beach head about 30 meters long was flattened by the lotus, and the outer wall was made of brick and stone, which was used as a temporary pier. Because it is a natural deep-water port, even the trestle is omitted. Even if it is a three-masted sea boat, you can directly dock it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the witches are the first to see the shoal in the opening stage, and they are curiously looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big pit over there is the dock that was collapsed before?" Anna walked to Roland and pointed to the busy position of a group of workers in the distance. "They are now What to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you heard about it." Roland was a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, Nanava told me that three workers were cut off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This incident and the detonation of the coke oven during the trial run are called the two most serious accidents in the new year in the Bianbu District. The latter can also be said to be the price that has to be paid for on the way. At least half of the former. The responsibility is the result of Roland’s care. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Considering that the soil of the shoal is relatively soft, the Minister of Construction Carl has suggested that it may be more secure to build a dock on the edge of the mountain, but he was vetoed. The main reason is that the construction period - it takes so long to settle a long slope, and then sink a dock in the old way, I am afraid that it will be delayed until next year to build the Thunder's steam ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the loose sand, he does not think that he needs to worry too much. Just let the lotus make the outline of the dock and pour concrete into the wall as well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project went very smoothly at the beginning, as he thought, after the concrete solidified, the walls looked quite solid, just like adding to the foundation. A stone wall. For this reason, Roland was also very self-satisfied, and felt that the civil dog was no different. As a result, he accidentally gave birth when installing the iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron gate with the thick arm was separated from the hummingbird and suddenly fell down with the concrete walls on both sides, smashing the workers installed below. . Although the hummingbird made the door panel lighter like a goose in the first place, the three people who were crushed were still seriously injured. If they were not treated by Nana, they would not be able to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the investigation, when the concrete wall was first filled, part of the sand was collapsed under the trampling of the workers, filling the bottom, causing the wall not to be close to the floor. Connected, surrounded by a flat, solid concrete, with a thin layer at the joint of the wall. When the iron gate is hung on such a wall, the weight is over the limit of the steel bar, and the consequences can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afterlife, this is definitely a serious mistake, but for this era, the casualties during construction are normal, so no one will Taking it seriously, it is not going to criticize the lord himself. The guilty conscience and guilty feeling can only be realized by Roland himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cleared his throat and converged his thoughts, "They are doing the pile retaining wall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Used to reinforce the soil on both sides of the dock?" Anna quickly guessed the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, like a tree root, cross-plugging into the ground can increase the friction between the sand so that the side walls do not collapse easily." Roland nodded, and with the previous lesson, this time, when filling the concrete, it will definitely check whether there is any residual sand inside the template. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, there is a boat coming!" Mystery suddenly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
