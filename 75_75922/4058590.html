			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after leaving the square, Mey heard a series of subtle footsteps behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Lannis, please wait for me, Mrs. Lannis!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She passed It took a while to realize that someone was calling myself, and looking back, I saw a 17-year-old girl running towards this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is wearing two horns, and the face is red because of the cold wind, but the cotton coat and boots are brand new, and the fabric and workmanship are also very solid. Two years ago, she would have thought that she was a pretty young lady. But now more and more people can afford new clothes, and it is no longer possible to judge identity by appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl ran to her side, took a few breaths of white gas, and separated the two salted fish in her hand and handed it to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Lannis, this is my thank you, please be sure to accept it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mei couldn't help but see, "Xie Li?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have long wanted to see you, if my father saw the drama of your performance, he I will be very pleased!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't know you, I don't know your father... I can say it from the beginning, what happened? "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Star of the West spent half a quarter of an hour before it was roughly understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl’s name is Jasmine. After visiting the convenience market, she just recognized her back. It’s a temporary move to catch up with the fish. Express your gratitude in your heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jasmine’s father was a First Army soldier who died in battle with the church, leaving only her and her mother. The City Hall's generous pension and priority recruitment policy made them unnecessary to worry about their lives, but the death of his father still made Jasmine sad for a while, until the new drama "The Life of Heroes" was staged, and she was revived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the drama, all those who died heroically because of guarding their families and kingdoms were given the title of hero by their majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mother said that he used to be just an ordinary hunter. He didn't expect to receive such honor after death - so if you have the chance to see you, She must let me thank you very much.” Jasmine said to Mei Yi deeply. “Now everyone calls me a hero’s daughter. I feel that my father is not far away from me. If it’s not the first army, Recruiting women, I also want to pick up the musket and fight the unscrupulous enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Mey was silent for a moment before he whispered Asked, "But it is possible to sacrifice in battle. Are you not afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jasmine nodded first, then shook his head again. "Every winter." We have to move our family to the Long Song Fortress. Many people will die on the road, and then they will be thrown into the Chishui River. Every time they hear a scream, they will mean that one person will die. In the slums, more people will die. Then, after a heavy snowfall, you can see frozen bodies everywhere on the street. At that time, I was often afraid of shaking. I am afraid that closing my eyes will become the next one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you don't want to go back to it, you need someone to stand up and fight for a new life." She said word by word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a line in the drama. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei, I felt a soft thing in my heart was touched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached out and touched the girl’s hair, "Even if everything is done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When When the narration in the drama asked this sentence, Mey vaguely remembered that the entire square was silent, and everyone held their breath and waited for the hero's answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Jasmine’s answer is as powerful as the “hero” in the drama, “because it deserves us to do so.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your thank you, I accepted it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
