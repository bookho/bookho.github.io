			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he listened to the kindness of his partner, the little girl didn’t have much hope in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is also aware of this matter, if the other party has heard the father's new news, His Majesty should have told her to go. Since there is no, the other party is mostly ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, it is as good as the two who care about her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you walked to the explorer, the lightning couldn’t help but frown. This person is too... exaggerated? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the age point of view, the flock of the self-proclaimed Sander Bird is only about 30 years old, with a blindfold on the right eye, embroidered with a bright color The roses, while the branches and green leaves under the flowers are on the face, occupying almost half of the cheeks, people can not help but doubt his taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a good explorer should not take people by appearance, his words and deeds are not much better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation, Sander Bird seems to be telling a arduous adventure with everyone, its exaggerated vocabulary makes lightning almost think he is walking through the end of the sea or hell. The edge, in fact, the scene he described is nothing but a burning island. Of course, there is indeed danger. The lava often ejects from the bottom of the sea, forming a huge steam cloud column, which not only easily blocks the line of sight, but the hot water drops are also a deadly threat to the crew... but after several generations of exploration, The area has a complete chart, as long as you choose the right route and hour according to the chart, you can basically avoid the danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was less than ten years old, she had already followed her father on the main island of the Fire Islands - off the volcano. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fjords, it must be a person who has discovered a new route, island or ruins to be called an explorer, but there are so many islands on the whirlpool, There are thousands of less talks, which will inevitably lead to the same as an explorer, but its level is vastly different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of lightning, there are only a few people who can be compared with their father, and Sander Bird is clearly not in the list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At one time she was even less interested in greeting, and when hesitated, someone suddenly took her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up and found that the other was Margaret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little guy, you are coming right," the businesswoman smiled affectionately. "I will introduce you to this. This is the adventure from Ssangyong Island." Home, also the chief of the Dragon Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Sander. He is also one of your father's admirers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name has been said before, Lightning abdomen, but since Margaret opened the head, she had to pile up a smile. "Hello, I am a lightning bolt, but also a fjord - although not born on the fjord islands." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, are you the daughter of Thunder?" Sander said with a smile. "I heard Ms. Margaret mentioned the greatest explorer. My daughter is now in the Grey Fort, and now I have finally seen myself. Um...I am really similar to the Thunder Master!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deceptive, my father said clearly Her appearance is more inclined to mothers who have never met. Lightning pulled the corner of the mouth. "Thank you, do you have any news of him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have only heard some rumors, some people say that he drifted to no one knows The island, some people say that he has actually returned to the fjord, just because of the incredible adventures after the shipwreck, so he did not open his voice, but was quietly preparing for a new expedition. As for other claims... especially those who do not The rumor of good intentions is not worth mentioning.” Sander is not incessant. “Of course, I personally prefer the second. After all, there are several reefs around the storm. It’s not insurmountable for Thunder adults. The danger - in fact, many people in his fleet have survived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This judgment is similar to her guess, the other's The appearance is a bit pleasing to the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether the father has found her, it doesn't matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he follows the path of the explorer, she believes that one day she will see him again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
