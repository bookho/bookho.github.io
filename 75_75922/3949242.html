			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter is a day of no harvest for most of the northerners, especially those near the Hermes Plateau. The demon moon brings not only continuous rain and snow, but also cold, hunger and death. But the "prosthetic leg" White is different. Every winter, the church's messenger will come to the door, let him drive to the border of the Wolfheart Kingdom to run a few miles, and take the suffering orphans into the carriage and carry it to the old holy city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good deal, and it’s almost a good thing to earn twenty silver wolves at a glance. This year's demon moon is almost at the end, this car should be the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, if you want to stay in the train, the snow will go down for a while, you are not like we eat snow every day." "You can't freeze it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is nothing," the messenger took out the jug and said, "The new holy city is much colder than here. On the plateau, leather and armor can't stop the cold. They are like perverted devils, and they are drilled into various parts of your body. Without the cold pills, it is really not the place where ordinary people can stay."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you said is," White nodded, he had not been to the New Holy City, and he did not want to go. What is the best place to have ice and evil beasts? However, as an experienced coachman, he can always find new topics, and the ambassador is much better than the last one. "Do you use this special glove made from the wolf skin from the west of the Grey Fort?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Do you know this?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, adults, I’ve been working this for almost thirty years," White said proudly. "First, driving for the Baron, then driving for the Countess, even for the wolf. The little princess drove the car. If it was not an accident, the leg was broken, maybe it is still in the Earl's House. They don't have anything else, Jinlong can be more, what the gray castle's fur and silverware, Yongdong's jewels and fjord crafts, when you get on the bus, you can't finish it, and your ears are screaming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out," the ambassador Head, "This is the origin of your nickname? What kind of accident?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s a riot of the people. What kind of villains are eating, what? Everything came out.” White spit. “They surrounded the carriage. I had to rush to fight the horse to protect the countess. The horse was shocked and fell. Going down, the car has turned over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you broke your leg?" The ambassador asked curiously, "What about the Countess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s better than me, there are cushions and thick quilts in the car, just swelled and bruised," White said. "She climbed out and ran, throwing me on the road. I I dragged my broken leg home and spent a lot of money to save myself a fake leg." He knocked on the copper stick that was exposed outside the pants. "But the Earl's House rushed me out on the excuse that I couldn't drive anymore. Come out, the damn aristocrat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a pity," the ambassador paused. "But the gods have not abandoned you, you are driving for the church now. "God is kind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, adults. God is merciful." No, if God is really kind, I should not let me meet such a thing. White thought that when I needed it the most, it didn't save me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the girl’s cry came from the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White tightens the reins and lets the two horses gradually stop The ambassador jumped out of the car and wandered behind the carriage. Soon, the sound of a whip flapped in the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor child, he sighed and endured, this is your savior. There is no messenger, you can't even support this winter, it will only become an unattended body on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the ambassador came back and climbed into the rut, "Go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You are sitting still. Driving!" White shook the reins and the carriage re-moved. “They are all from the wolf heart kingdom?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost, the churches in the towns of the kingdom will contain some orphans, especially when the food and clothing are scarce in winter. We will accommodate several times more people. The monks of the church alone can't take care of them, so they will also entrust the car dealers to hire some reputable drivers to help us deliver them. You performed very well, White, my predecessor You praise it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
