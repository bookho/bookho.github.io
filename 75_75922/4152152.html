			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, my subordinates report, the wind whistle has been conquered by us not long ago, the worms are fleeing to the south!" Kneeling, shouting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You did a good job! I will report this credit to Lord Scorpio." Totolock nodded with approval. Continue to cut the fronts of the worms to the east until they are defeated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This war will bring you more than one promotion opportunity, take advantage of the opportunity to exchange honor with their blood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Subordinates!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the ascendant retire, Totolock sneered and looked at the map provided to the human aristocracy. "The bugs are just that, Heckstead is too much of a concern. Their traps may take effect twice, but it is impossible to take effect. The war is ultimately determined by positive forces. Their resistance is even better than four hundred. It was a lot stronger than before, and it could not make up for the overall gap between the ethnic groups."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But our losses are not "The tears of the chin of the West Asia screams," lost nearly 40,000 warriors in eight days, and the frontline troops have already lost 30%. If this is done again, the follow-up forces may be broken."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about that? Resist in the early stage, late collapse, is this not the consistent performance of the worm?" Totolock did not think, "In the battle of the gods, only more The tough race that can withstand casualties can win the final victory. Now the western heart of the wolf has fallen into my hand, how long can the remaining two cities last? When we double-team, they will soon lose The will to fight - as it is now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Asia has no rebuttal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the strength of human resistance is somewhat unexpected, it still agrees with the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, it has seen too many times the stalemate suddenly collapsed, as if the seemingly sturdy frozen river was instantly broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cause often only requires a crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans always resist the strongest at the beginning, but as the casualties continue to grow and fail again and again, they will gradually lose confidence and internal Split, and finally completely lose the will to confront. The casualties of the early ethnic groups will be greater than the opponents, but as long as the pressure continues, the situation will reverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the later stages, it is not an exaggeration to use the wind to escape and describe human beings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a purely courage issue, but, as Totolock said, it stems from the essential gap between the two ethnic groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They need a lot of rest, need to eat, need a warm bed and a windproof home, but this is a difficult condition to achieve in war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has studied humans carefully, and even if you don’t have to look at it at the moment, you can imagine how bad the situation is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous attacks for several days, using the original body as a consumable, plus the quantitative advantage, human beings can hardly be under such conditions Get enough rest time, the spirit must be on the verge of collapse; as for the abundant food and residence, don't even think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These unfavorable conditions will continue to ruin their morale. The news of the fall of Jinshiling and Fengxiaobao will soon spread in the military. When the two are superimposed How long can the fine sand city and Shenchi Bay last? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ethnic group does not need these things, whether it is eating or resting, can be solved through life, the more cruel the war, the more obvious the advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siassis agrees with Heikezod, but it firmly believes that victory will eventually belong to the ethnic group, and humans, not worms, have done enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will bring the winning message back to Tianzhu City, and the next attack will be handed over to you for the time being." It said, "Don't look down on each other, Try to use the existing power to occupy the wolf heart - this time we should not add too much burden to the rear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After withdrawing to the safe zone, it took more than ten hours to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he woke up, he only felt weak and his stomach was a little uncomfortable. He subconsciously wanted to touch the dry food in his pocket, only to find that his clothes had been replaced with new ones, and there were no familiar rifles at the bedside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are ten wooden beds in the camp, but they are all empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...the battlefield hospital? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably because of the side effects caused by the failure of the retardant when he fainted, the expression was too terrible, and was sent to his teammates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how the law is now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to reveal her identity, she is suffering from severe pain, destroying the wounds, and even if it does not endanger her life, it is estimated to be a long period of time. Time can be recovered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of a comrade-in-arms who had been with him for half a year, he was a famous goddess, and he felt that his cheeks were a little hot--when he was withdrawing from the winds and whiffs, He still has no idea in this regard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this incitement and sorrow was quickly dispelled by a strong sense of hunger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he doesn't hurry to eat something, he suspects that he may fall again at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;裘 缓 缓 slowly crawling from the bed, dragging the weak body toward the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, just opened the curtain, a burst of rich meat scented into his nostrils, the scent is so enticing, it’s like heaven It’s delicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you awake?” A nurse quickly noticed him. “Isn’t it confessed? The retardant can’t be eaten, you have to If you have a grain, I am afraid I will wake up. Now that I am starving, I will take you to the cafeteria."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the other person walks into a big account, I almost couldn't believe my eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw seven or eight iron buckets lined up on the long table, filled with steaming food, from the meat to the soup. Everyone lined up in a horizontal team, carrying a lunch box through the long table in turn, and when the food in the bucket was consumed halfway, someone would pour new into it - no doubt, these meals were made by the logistics department. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...this is too extravagant, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Mo Jin hunter who used to compete with other small clans in the past, he naturally knows how difficult it is to provide fresh food to a team of people, not to mention the war period. Now! The front line of the First Army clearly shows that even personnel and ammunition are caught in the air. How can it be used for such things? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the 裘da couldn’t help but ask the doubts in his heart, the nurse chuckled. “These are not from the Grey Fort, they come from The cities in the morning light. It is not the first army and the caravans that transport them, but the people you rescued."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We saved ......人?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” the other’s tone is full of gentleness. “There are both the fugitives of the Yongdong Kingdom and the wolves. Some of the refugees went to no winter, while the other part hoped to stay and do something to fight the devil. These are the ones that they used to carry the cart, even the hand to pick the shoulders, and shipped them here a little. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;裘达 suddenly did not know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also performed evacuation missions. To be honest, those refugees did not cooperate in the first place. There were occasional conflicts on both sides. He had complained privately about this. And treat them as incurable idiots. But now, it is these "stupid people" who bring a hot meal for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not just the rescued person," the nurse’s tone looked very happy. “The group of merchants in the morning also stood on our side, they not only provided a lot of The horses also actively reduced the price of the food, so everyone can enjoy fresh hot rice hot dishes here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
