			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maggie!" Ashes screamed and kept everyone behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An answer to her is a series of painful coughs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it sounds terrible, it is still alive at least. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your reaction is very fast, extraordinary." The devil reveals a regrettable look that is unique to human beings. "If it wasn't your sword, she should have There is no pain to die. But if you do this, it is meaningless except to continue the torture she has suffered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Maggie as the first goal and perhaps It’s no coincidence that looking at the other person’s eyes, Andrea suddenly realized that this was probably a thoughtful shot. On the single-handedly fighting, Maggie can play a very limited role, but as the only witch who can take everyone out of the predicament, once removed first, others will be cut off the retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She bit her lip and sneaked back and saw that the bone spear was just inserted in Maggie’s shoulder, and the blood leached to dye the clothes. A large piece. Probably hurt the lungs, Maggie's breath is very weak, and there is blood coughing from time to time. If the ashes are not picked up, I am afraid that it has pierced the heart of the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it hurts to this extent, even if she is not dead, it is impossible to control her ability and maintain the magical Ark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the other party know about Maggie's ability? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the "eye" of human beings, right? If it weren't for you, we wouldn't be forced to this extent by the fire. "The next thing the sorcerer tears her last glimpse into a glimpse - the other first refers to Sylvie, then to Andrea," and you should be the sharpshooter. The embarrassing ability, perhaps nothing four hundred years ago, but now may be more difficult than the extraordinary, but fortunately you are finally gathered together. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After it was finished, it extended its right hand and pressed it on the chest. "Please allow me to introduce myself - my name is Erskuk, the expeditionary army." The commander is also your burial. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly a premeditated trap.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia The face is getting harder to look at.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did it start, the sorcerer and the turbulent magical fluctuations are equal?<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes... Since the other side went to the north of the fascinating forest and attacked the leaves for more than ten years, its striking features were remembered in the hearts of everyone.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it can be traced back a bit longer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When lightning hits the demon for the first time, it feels like it is real The powerful magic. Since it is so powerful, can it be captured by the magic eye beyond the observation distance, is it not a matter of course?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in the long after In the fight, the other party constantly strengthened this impression and exposed his whereabouts under the surveillance of Hilli, and also made everyone believe in it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbs p; but all this is nothing but the illusion of the slayer's forgery.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It regards itself as a bait and draws everyone's attention to the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Is it from the beginning, is it ready for today?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case The argument cannot be established at all! Even if the enemy perceives the existence of Sylvie and his own existence through the battle of the North Slope, it is decided to be quick, but in order to lay a trap, this high-order devil who claims to be Erskuk is real. I lost Takira and buryed thousands of demons on the fertile plains! If it is cruel and ruthless, and does not care about the lives of the people, then the remains of the holy city? Without the stone veins, they cannot establish an obelisk, which means For the next four hundred years, the devil will completely lose the chance to get into the fertile plains. If you count this as a price, it will be too big!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they really worthy of the enemy?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Why? Tachella should be much more important than us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorcerer’s accident did not immediately start, but shook his head slightly. "I can't tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if you want to know the answer before you die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But you are not dead yet." Erskuk's tone brought a sneer. "Even if you are trapped in a cage, you still haven't given up, aren't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;What is it waiting for? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is waiting for the throwing magic stone to fully recover...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but its arm does not wither Signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, this is an opportunity - Andreia swallowed, from the results of the last fight, the gray top can only temporarily Dragging the demon, and her magic is running low, together can not increase the winning percentage to more than 50%. As for Sylvie, Camilla and Maggie, don't mention it, they will only make the winning rate lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only breakthrough is in lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has not shown her head so far, which means that she is aware of the anomaly. If she can guide the Seagull to come to support, they will have the possibility of defeating the victory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of forcing a shot now, it’s better to ask more questions to delay the time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of doubt in her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about this, Andrea looked at the demon, whispered, "I don't understand... even if we are attracted by illusion It is also impossible to ignore an enemies who are nearby. Before we fired, we have clearly checked the surrounding four--there are eight or nine kilometers away from the Taqila. It will not be able to arrive at one and a half. What are you hiding in? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past six months, we dug a lot of underground passages, but not at the front, but behind the Taqila." Erskuk does not matter Not slow to return, "the entrance of the passage is located in the Shenshi mining area, it is difficult to find itself, and these ramps are buried very deep, you are neglected and normal." It looked up at the sky, "humans have been monitoring This area is right, right? Not to mention that you have not relaxed your vigilance along the way, and the wind and the grass on the surface are all in sight. It is this kind of safe appearance that makes you ignorantly step into the trap."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a channel nearby? Andrea felt vaguely uneasy. "Even if you hide in the ground, you just hide yourself. It is never an easy task to find us in such a large area. Besides, we have changed many times these days. Location, how did you see us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't see you, but you saw me." The sorcerer suddenly showed awkward Smile, "Right, I have seen more than one person before... The little guy who will fly? If you have a backhand, should you arrive?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia is like an ice cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you see it, it will also see you" - this is the characteristic of the alert eye, is it a shot? Only a thousand eyes can't be? But its body should be far greater than the demon, or is it that Erskuk has other methods to let the flying devil possess some of the power of the eye? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these are no longer important, she now fully understands where the previous sense of uneasiness came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since there is a hidden underground passage, how can it be hidden only by the demon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the enemy did not start, waiting for the reinforcements to come to rescue - it wants to kill them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, several grenade screamed out of the woods and ran straight to the side of Ursuk! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter flew straight, effortlessly escaped this round of raids, the grenade went on the cast, and plunged into the forest, setting off a fierce Explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
