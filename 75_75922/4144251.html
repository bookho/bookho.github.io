			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, Your Majesty, what Anna’s Highness is driving... What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Looking back, I saw Echo and Soroya also ran out of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a car! Rubik's Cube!" Waiting for him to speak, the mystery month has already replied first, "If you want to experience it, please let me go, don't allow the team!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Steam... car?" Soloya repeated this new term, "Steam-driven car?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Well, but the boiler part has been replaced by the relics of the radioactive family to narrow it down to this extent." Mystery month slammed the message he had inquired, "but compared to the electric motor, they It's still too big. If you use the Twilight One to drive, it is the perfect form of the car... No, it should be called a magnetic car at that time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Who is the usual screaming to enchant dozens of copper rods?” Lily snorted. “I still want to pack the car now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃-" The mystery of the moon is low. "I, I didn't have much time in adulthood. Now the lack of magic does not mean that it will be like this in the future. Maybe next. Awakening can easily enchant a lot of Twilight No.1."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope that you will not be able to evolve and expect Miss Doris to gain magical ability. Break through." Lily shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will steal my chaotic drink again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Dare-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha..." Felice smirked. "In fact, whether it is driven by steam or electric, it is called a car." Oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? Is it?" The witches looked at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, in the world of dreams, it is named like this." There is a disguise in the words of Felice, "compared to the opening of His Royal Highness." This car, there is much more complete, not only can avoid the wind and rain, winter heating, summer and air conditioning, and even can be used as a free-moving house. As for driving, it is even more powerful, even the most Good horses can't catch up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...had it opened?" Mystery Moon enviously blinked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Felice intoxicated. "I used to drive my car through an endless road. When the speed was added to the limit, the wind roared almost obscured. Everything, the body is shaking, it seems like a hurricane, the feeling is really confusing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is because of the sound insulation effect of their own vehicles Too bad, plus the suspension of the cart, the same as the high speed. Roland couldn't help but lift the amount. It was just an unpretentious van, but it was hard to let the other person describe the feeling of a luxury car. This contrast made him a bit shameful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, even if it’s a cheaper noodle, the completion is indeed much higher than this Rubik's cube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From start-up to finished product release, the car took less than four days - it uses the front steam engine and the rear heated water tank. The whole power system is simply and rudely fixed on the frame, and a sofa is placed in the middle, even if it is done. It doesn't have a gearbox in the traditional sense, not even the throttle. In addition to the steering wheel, clutch and brakes, only the air valve at the seat is controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ceremonial cube heats the water enough to drive the steam engine, the vehicle can move, and as the steam pressure in the pipeline increases, the speed will increase. The sooner. At this time, the opening degree of the gas valve is selected, and a part of the steam is discharged from the tail pipe, so that the steam engine is not overloaded, and the driving speed can be controlled in a disguised manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, you want to slow down the brakes and the clutch, and the only way to speed up is to release the brakes and let it recover a little bit. The highest speed. At the same time, under high air pressure, the direct rotation of the rapidly rotating gear may cause damage, so once the vehicle is completely stopped, the air valve must be opened to lower the air pressure and start climbing again from the low speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
