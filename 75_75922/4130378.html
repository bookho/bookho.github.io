			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the Seagull disappeared completely into the sky, Roland regained his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes I want to build a frontline command," he whispered. "Being in a place that everyone can see, it can boost morale." It is also a personal involvement in the battle of the gods. After the history officials recorded it, they can also boast more capital."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you care about that?" In the same way, there was a low response. "Why, before you are recorded in history, you have to endure the chatter of Wendy and the book until you take the initiative to admit your mistakes and change your mind. I have experienced it. It is definitely not something that ordinary people can bear." Or give them less trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Nong Jun can't help but say, "That's right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The battle with the devil is likely to last for months, even years, and he has to work hard to adapt to this new normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he looks to the guards who are in the distance. "Call people, then I will go to the third side of the city." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter immediately took a gift, "Yes, Your Majesty! I will inform the guards!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;According to the report of Camo Spoel, the research on rubber worms has made new progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s time to test the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go," he nodded to the side and then headed for the airport exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming the important use value of rubber worm secretions, Tachair The witch not only opened up a series of new caves for him, but also took up the role of a breeder in his spare time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, it’s not easy to find ordinary people who can face the worms and talk and laugh in the wormholes, and it’s easier to work in the underground for a long time. Psychological instability, the farming part has now been fully taken over by Takira, workers are only responsible for the shipment and processing of rubber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that this is another prediction error of Roland, who underestimated the tolerance of people in a claustrophobic environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubber worms hate the sun, love the moisture, and follow the sound, even if there is no offensiveness, then the sound of the sounds that sounded around from time to time is enough The spirit is weak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t provide lighting and communication equipment for each worker, make detailed shift rules, and get a set of psychological comfort guidance – not to say no To, but the price is too low, a large number of factories outside need people, can be used to pull in, no need to spend on the form of witching. So he simply turned ordinary people into a more relaxed follow-up process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the chicken and duck knight Prius Desa is not idle, the time spent vacating is used to write the breeding manual and guide the production, no winter The city's related products can spring up like mushrooms, and he also has credits that cannot be ignored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of the expanded farming provides more samples for the glue test. It is with these basic research that Roland has the opportunity to involve the Minister of Chemical Industry. The conditions for the next step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the underground, Pasha greeted him. "Welcome to you, Your Majesty. Your people are now in the glueworm laboratory. Do you need me to inform them?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, you take me in the past," Roland laughed. "Right, I heard that Celine has built a new farm, than before." How many of them are big?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it is opposite the lab," Pasha said, the Lord must, "not only the Quest The latest research results, but also draw on the concept of the dream world - do you want to visit it by the way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" He suddenly came to the mood, "Of course."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An iron fence is placed at the entrance of the cave, apparently to prevent the worm from escaping. From a small door on the side, he couldn't help but glimpse it. The environment in the cave was completely designed according to the ruins of the snow-capped mountains. The luminescent plants, water systems and giant mushrooms were all available, but the three were obviously adjusted. The plants are arranged along the edge of the stone wall and flowing water, which has become a new street lamp. As the staple food of the worm, the mushroom is obviously the most abundant species. The huge mushroom umbrella almost covers the ground tightly, and numerous insects are surging among them. Under the dim fluorescence, only a group of creeping white bodies can be seen. They happily ate the mushrooms, and the dense snoring made Roland think of the silkworms that were raised as a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him even more was the size of the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the illuminating plant at the end of the eye, it is only afraid that it is bigger than the main hall of the third side of the city - he thought the new farm was It is a combination of several old caves, but it does not seem to be the case now. The well-ordered blue light point and the straight-lined water system made him feel like a big factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is just at the edge of the desolate mountains, which is about the same height as the winter city." Pasha took the initiative to say, "If you open a hole from the south side, it is away." Kingdom Road is only a kilometer away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that the new farm and the winter city are only separated by a wall. If he remembers correctly, estimate the distance that has just been moved. It will not exceed two kilometers from the main city. The outside of the rock wall should be the temporary residential area of ​​the migrants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows, "To facilitate the delivery of mucus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly. Pasha raised the Lord's beard. "Look, look at the southern end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked along the other's direction - I saw a deep squat under the wall The horizontal groove is like an escape route specially reserved for rubber worms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Retrieving area." Pasha explained, " With the characteristics of the worm's vocalization, Celine cuts a narrower passage on the wall. As long as a specific scream is made in the other hair, they will drill into it and move toward the sound source - but limited by The width of the channel, they can only find half of the head, and the body will be stuck in the road."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then?" Can't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next we will start the magic core at the end of the channel." Pasha continued, "It has been adjusted to the sharp-edged mode, which is generally used for defense." The narrow enemy. The core will shoot a magical light, fill the entire main space, and tear any obstacles in front of the light. And the horizontal passage is the path through which the magic light passes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bug will be split into two, and the mucus in the belly will gather together with the drainage trough in the transverse groove, so that one does not need to kill only one. A lot of mucus can be obtained in one go." She paused. "The reason why the distance of one kilometer is reserved is reserved for the collector. According to Celine's assumption, ordinary workers can enter from outside the mountain. The reclaiming area, except for the grooves and pools that flow with mucus, can't be seen. This is convenient for collection and is not easy to cause panic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has nothing to add. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program is mature under the existing technology, considering the whole process from breeding to harvesting, if you build a rubber factory outside the mountain, it is simply Even the production and processing are packaged. In particular, this modern style of streamlined slaughter line is an idea learned from the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the precious magic core and Catherine’s lifelong research is used as a rude butcher’s knife. Is it a bit too big? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you can’t find the winner, you can’t activate the instrument, you don’t have to be so self-defeating...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; No, Roland suddenly found a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many rubber worms can this farm contain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
