			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shuanglong Island has not been so lively for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder standing on the snow wind The top of the bridge tower, overlooking the crowded wharf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of people gathered here, moving a box of materials to the Shanghai ship, looking from the heights, it is like ants in a series of columns. The sound of snoring, the sound of the horn and the rustling of the sea waves hitting the beach formed the main theme before the flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the dock is a variety of sailboats that are densely packed together with freeboards on the freeboard. The high-rise masts are one after another, like a continuous mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flag fluttering at the peak marks the fleet: String Moon Bay, Sunset Island, Shallow Water City... These chambers with a pivotal position in the fjord are now gathering Here, just wait for the moment when the anchor is set sail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time like this, it was the day when he was twenty-two years old, gathering troops to the shadows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not just Ssangyong Island," said Margaret, who was next to her. "It should be said that the entire fjord has been stirred up by the news you brought back. The seemingly worthless route has now become the hot spot – safe and stable, and the opportunity to be a true explorer. The new generation can be said to have been born in a good time.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder also raised his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the other party is talking about the Daqing Port route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you discover novelty relics in the endless cape, no matter what, you can exchange rewards from the king of the Grey Fort." The news was brought back to the fjord. After that, it immediately set off a big crash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurer title can be said to have great appeal to the fjords, it not only represents fame, but also symbolizes wealth. However, it is not easy to find new routes, islands or major secrets. This requires a lot of investment, and it is possible that the blood will not be returned, and even the life will be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recruitment of the King of the Grey Fort has changed all of this. From the fjord to the Endless Cape is a very mature route, and the new port city of Daqing is It means business opportunities, even if you don’t find anything, you can at least lose some goods, and you won’t lose money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you really find something good, then it is natural to do both. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the news clearly states that these ancient relics are likely to be related to a great secret about the Three Gods, as long as they can contribute to the unraveling of it, There is a chance to get the title awarded by the Grey Fortress - a lifetime honorary explorer. Although the Grey Fort and the Fjord Islands are not the same as the land kingdom, it is an undisputed standard where the conditions are placed, or the fjord needs to be more valued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, it is related to the three gods they believe in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the news brought back by Thunder is so attractive, a small number of people have raised doubts, but these suspicions have not affected the enthusiasm of the merchants. The reputation of the King of the Grey Fortress spread as soon as chaotic drinks and perfumes swept across the fjord market. More and more goods from the other side of the strait, as well as steaming paddle boats that are becoming more commonplace, have made the name Roland Wimbledon often mentioned, and the concept of the incomparable wealth of the winter city is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of the United Chamber of Commerce has strengthened people’s confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the big employer is the king of a country, it is still the kind of strength, what is wrong with the price code? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the news spread, almost all the idlers in the fjord acted, so that the islands were divided into two factions - experienced and courageous The batch of people who tried to get on the Thunder’s fleet and who were mainly stable and hoped to make good luck, sailed to the endless cape and tried to occupy a good position in Daqing Port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t see it with your own eyes, it’s hard for the Thunder to imagine a country across the sea that can have such a big impact on the fjord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware of such changes, only in the last couple of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should know that I am willing to do this," Margaret put his hand on the back of his hand. "If you owe a debt to a person who is not asking for compensation, is it too far-sighted? Not to mention the voyage is just around the corner. It’s better to say less.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Margaret...” Thunder moved back to sight, as opposed to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, it’s not true to say that you are not asking for compensation at all. I am... there are still some things I want," Margaret blinked. "So you should be a good idea when I don't have a picture. Don't feel what you owe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder naturally understand what she wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of the winter city to see the lightning and her harmonious relationship, he did not feel that something was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, he has long been used to the existence of the other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange thing is that no matter whether he is facing a hurricane or a big wave when he is taking risks, he has never hesitated. However, he feels particularly difficult in this respect. Opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the Thunder hesitated whether to turn over his hand to grab her palm, the voice of the first officer interrupted the solitude of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Head--!" The latter stood on the bridge terrace and shouted at the neck. "The caravans are basically ready. Just wait for you to speak!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder coughed twice, "Hear it! I will come soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"好咧!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath and looked at Margaret, "Going out."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go," Margaret nodded with a smile. "Go to what you do best, as you have said -"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Thunder answered. "-Go to the New World."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking down the tower, through the bridge, he came to the ship along the deck, facing the crowd on the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of warm cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder waved his hand, "I think everyone already knows, this time we have to take the route - so far, the farthest place in the fjord has been The shadow sea area is the first line, but for the vortex sea, it is just stepping out of the house. This time, we will cross the shadow sea, cross the incredible sea line, and go to the farther place in the east - the piece has not been involved The blank place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have seen a vast expanse of land in the shadows of the monuments, no less inferior to the territory of the four kingdoms. Where is it? Will it be east of the sea line? This is an exciting question, and this time we are going to find the answer. If it does exist, then the fjords will bid farewell to the narrow and scarce Land, no longer need to worry about living space! At the same time, it will bring us more wealth than the sum of all routes to this day - this is why I welcome any capable people to join: such a big return, even more The people who go to the points are also completely enough!"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused for a moment, waiting for a wave of crowds to sigh, and then said, "But aside from the Golden Dragon and fame, I want something else - - That is, the fjord is remembered by history! There are few references to our fragments in the history books of the four kingdoms. The fjord has neither a family of centuries nor a supreme king, far outside the mainland, like an island. Except for the caravan, there is almost no impact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this situation will not last forever, when we open up new fertile soil for all mankind, bring When subverting the broad vision of common sense, history will always record us and record every explorer who embarks on the fearless journey! I hope that you can understand that the significance of this adventure is not only now but also in the future!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rising sails, guys!" Thunder raised his arms high, "Starting in the New World!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There are countless hands under the lift, and the voice of the word is resounding. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
