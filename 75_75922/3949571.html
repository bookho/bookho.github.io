			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water vapor condenses a uniform white mist on the window glass, like a thin gauze. When the wind is cold, the squeaking of the window is striking, and the room where the fire is burning quietly stands in stark contrast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book sits at the long desk of the City Hall office and flips through a volume of thick documents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the document has nothing to do with education, but the statistics collected by various departments. Whenever she has time, she will write down these things for everyone to check- This is one of her main recent jobs, and the Ministry of Education has nothing to deal with. After all, the second round of assessments is only short, and the next round is estimated to be implemented in the summer of next year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a year of working for Roland, she found that her Highness has an extra preference for data, and everything likes to be transformed into a long list of precise numbers to describe The horizontal ratio, the year-on-year ratio, and the ring ratio are all the nouns that are often lingering. Up to now, all members of the City Hall have also been infected with this trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the growing population of the town, the relevant statistics have also increased dramatically, and His Royal Highness has entrusted this task to himself, and he also laughs at himself. It is the "database" of Bianbu Town. Although it sounds like something like a warehouse, but His Highness has made it particularly important. With a database, you can calculate the development of the next year and develop economic and military plans. Even all the strategies in the future will be based on data analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bookman," the wooden door of the office was suddenly pushed open, and an apprentice dressed woman walked in. She handed in a request form to the book after the ceremony. In the past, "Hello, I am Fuya. The Carter of the Ministry of Justice wants to get the information on the fugitives who passed the residence review last week. You have already approved the application."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the limited number of use of branching capabilities, His Royal Highness must first pass Barov's consent when querying complex data. As for individual data, you can ask her at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly wait," the book swept the signature on the list, then summoned the book of magic and showed the corresponding content on the page. "Okay, Give this to Mr. Carter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, thank you." She carefully picked up this golden book that emerged from the sky, and looked like a hug. A wicked beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, it won't hurt you." The book can't help but laugh. Most people will reveal this when they first contact the book of magic. Expression, "You don't need to return the book to me. It will disappear automatically after two hours, but according to the confidential regulations, you must not hand it over to people outside Carter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...Adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person left and pushed open the door, the book can see the crowd in the hall, Noisy sounds poured into the room instantly, and soon quieted as the door closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the weekend, it should be a day of rest, but the city hall is still as busy as ever. Everyone knows that the border town is about to build a city. It is especially hard to do it, and with the overtime pay rewards proposed by His Royal Highness, no one wants to stay at home at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book does not understand the way of His Royal Highness. In her opinion, the work of the City Hall is not too heavy, compared to the miners who are quite physically exhausted. And the kiln workers don't have to spend much time writing paperwork, statistics, and reporting – and that's the main job of the City Hall. As long as His Highness makes an order, everyone will readily comply, and it is not necessary to raise salaries on this. For most nobles, his approach is too generous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highland is not like a real lord. This is the view of the heart of the book. It can be a person like this, but it leads everyone to the point of today. Have to say that it is a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t think so because of her respect and trust, but the data clearly stated it all: compared to a year ago, there were only miners in Bianyan Town. With stable income, the lowest-paid miners, kiln workers, and handymen are now twice as expensive, and some emerging occupations, such as steam plant assemblers and acid plant operators, are paid eight times more. And the number is still growing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention the changes in the town itself, if not always living here, it is hard for anyone to believe the current town and a year ago It is the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
