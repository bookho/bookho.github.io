			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the meeting, Roland left Barov alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also saw that the current chemical laboratory dignitaries, the Grey Fortune Industrial Company dignitaries, and then I intend to mass produce soap and perfume, these same "There is a lot of manpower," the prince said bluntly. "When most of the townspeople pass the primary education assessment, they will get at least next year, and they will be full of six or seven hundred people. It is not enough. I need more people."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are recruited from the fortress..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Roland interrupted. "After the city is built next year." The fortress will be connected to the town as a whole. This is equivalent to putting the money in the left pocket into the right pocket. I need more people outside the West."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This..." Barov is somewhat awkward. "I am afraid that it is not so well solved. If you go to other cities to fish, the local lords will not sit idly by."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not go to the city," Roland put his fingers into the cup, took some ice water, and slashed on the table. I don't know if you noticed that the gray castle has been in the midst of war since the end of the demon month. It includes several attacks on the south by Tiefko, which caused the Eagle City to be burned, and the surrounding villages and towns were seriously damaged. Then It was to conquer the north and deprive the Duke of Ace of the title and territory of treason. The last is the sea attack in the east." He hit the table twice, leaving a water stain, "Let Haifeng County, Jinsui Both the city and the crows of the crows have been greatly affected, not to mention the surrounding small towns. From the number of people who fled to the capital, it can be seen how much the loss is."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..." Barov showed a thoughtful expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Promoting the West," the prince wiped out all the water. "In the past six months, only the West was in peace, there was no mandatory recruitment, and no war. Invasion. In particular, the first point - the use of civilians by Tiffco, will certainly recruit and even plunder civilians everywhere. No one can guarantee that this will not fall on his head next time. A stable place is the point of our propaganda."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I probably understand," he thought, "you are planning to pass the unforced, unserved, and at the same time Provide the promise of shelter, food and stable work to attract civilians from other towns and villages?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost," Roland nodded with a smile, thinking Active and accepting ability has always been the advantage of the assistant of the minister. "And it is also important to publicize the generous treatment that people who are literate can enjoy. I think there will be some knights and nobles who are willing to come to the West to try their luck. ""<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is a village or a town, it is almost the territory of a small nobility. If you are in peacetime, even if the land is poor again, the operation will be poor, and you will be able to fill your stomach with a few acres of land. However, if the population loss during the turbulent period is serious, the days will be difficult to continue. At this time, there is a safe place to go. Most people should be tempted. Anyway, even if they are left unattended, they will not be taken over by others. Waiting for this time, they will take the money and mercenaries back to take over the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for how to promote, he believes that the other party has its own way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Your Highness, as a result, the placement of these people is a cost, and the food can not be interrupted," Barov hesitated. What happened to a caravan, the town hall treasury will soon dry up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well... what you said makes sense," Roland touched. Touching the chin, the most important task of the new political force is to establish prestige and confidence in the hearts of the people. If you suddenly fall into the predicament of pay, the good situation will turn sharply. "So, you should go back and do a good job, wait until the caravan The town completed the next month's transaction, and the treasury was fulfilled and implemented."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Follow, Your Highness," Barov raised his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the task, Roland returned to the office and began thinking about how to complete Margaret's balloon order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of a thousand gold dragons is higher than that of a steam engine, but its cost is much lower. The airbag is mainly drawn by Soroya, and the hemp rope Bamboo baskets are all cheap. In fact, Roland has experimented with a simple sample in the arsenal yard: a hydrogen balloon that can carry both lightning and wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
