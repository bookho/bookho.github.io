			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After visiting the farm, Roland came to the rubber insect laboratory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a thirty-flat house like an ancient wizard's alchemy room - a row of gluey glue barrels on the wall, solidified The milky white glue sticks everywhere. A large pot of burnt pieces of glue is emitting an unpleasant smell, and God knows what they have put into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long handle spoon, bucket and stir bar used in the test deepen the feeling. If you match a few cockroaches and bats, it is simply A perfect restoration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty," Camo Spoel simply nodded to show his salute. "What you want, I think I have found it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland noticed his pale face and the gauze wrapped in his fingers. "Are you injured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "A little problem, nothing matters," he waved his hand, then handed over a cup of light red mucus. "Look, look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Kaimo reversed the cup, but the liquid did not spill, but slowly creeped along the wall of the cup, forming a soft hemisphere at the mouth of the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s eyes lit up and he reached out to catch the jelly-like substance, but was stopped by the chief alchemist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, squat!" He took back the cup. "This thing is corrosive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember that the rubber worm mucus should be non-toxic and harmless," Roland said. Otherwise, it will not be used to make food packaging bags and straws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But after mixing the blood, it does change its nature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood?" Roland gave a slight glimpse and couldn't help but look at his fingers. "Is the wound in your hand for the experiment..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, it was just an accident. "Kemo touched his beard and smiled. "I'm crazy, I don't want to experiment with myself. The road to chemistry is so long, I hope I can go further."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the other party's explanation, Roland finally understood the discovery process of the new colloid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coagulability of rubber worm mucus comes from the mixing of glandular secretions, and according to the difference between the two, can form different hardness of bio-rubber, but they are It does not have fluidity and cannot be changed once it has been consolidated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo began to follow the experience of chemical experiments, adding various elemental elements or acid and alkali, can not reverse the final result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the selection of materials further relaxed, from complex inorganic salts to organic matter, were thrown into the observation effect. Although a lot of interesting special colloids were found in the process, it was never possible to get the new gel Roland wanted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until an accident occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He accidentally cut his finger while cutting the waste strip, and the dripping blood contaminated a cup of experimental sample to be consolidated. A lot of white gas suddenly appeared in the cup, and the mushroom that was put into it melted into a pool of yellow water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution also became a semi-condensable gel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the biggest feature is that you can retain the characteristics of the mixed materials." Kemer threw the gel into the stove, and it suddenly issued The bright light, the flame also rushed a few feet high, instead of slowly blackening like the previous rubber block, and finally turned into a pool of powder. "I only added a spoonful of oil to it. It may not be able to achieve this effect alone. It can be said that it is better than what you ask for!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although the voice of the old alchemist is a bit tired, his tone is full of excitement. Looking at the exuberant fire, Camo's eyes seemed to be burning with a group of flames - he apparently had conceived in his mind the sight of the gel being used in large quantities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coalted gasoline is what Roland tried to make. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he saw that the rubber worm mucus had similar coagulation properties, he was thinking about it - if you can fully fuse the mucus with the igniter and burn it fully, you can get a simple and rude weapon. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the red fog is fearful of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the era of Tacila, the most headache for the Federation was the already completed outpost. The red fog covered by a small area allowed the Saints to join hands and feet. They could only rely on the witches with isolation or clearance ability to move slowly with everyone. The task of dismantling the storage tower fell to the mortal army. Often, when the war is over, the holy army will pay a great price because it cannot be flexible, and mortals will have no return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this cruel exchange ratio that every time the devil establishes an outpost, it can weaken the power of the federation until the latter can no longer prevent the other’s actions. In the end, the devil who came from all directions was dragged down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have the ability to arbitrarily arson, the threat of enemy outposts will be greatly reduced, and the red fog that the devil lives on will also tighten their necks. Noose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably because the impression of defeat was too deep, Pasha would be so enamored with rubber worms - especially Elwy, at the beginning In the third side of the city, raising unknown insects is quite vocal. Since Roland has stated the concept of solid fuel weapons, her attitude has changed 180 degrees, even the tone of the bugs is different. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland now does not have to bite the scalp and the devil in close quarters, he will never let the first army leave the artillery cover until all active targets have disappeared. range. Therefore, the incendiary bomb is more of an auxiliary means of attack. It belongs to the product of "the egg is not placed in a basket". It does not affect the entire strategic plan. If it does, it will save the next part of the gunpowder and reduce the production of the chemical plant. pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this premise, it is natural that Camo Spoel can find something, but the problem is...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blood is not a convenient source of raw materials."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured, Your Majesty," the alchemist replied, "not It’s not necessary for human blood... The blood of cattle, sheep and other animals can also change its nature, which I have tested. The only premise is that it must be just released.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives Roland a lot of relief, but the second question comes with it, "Why is it blood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Kemo was dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think, maybe it’s related to the bug itself." Pasha answered. "Although it doesn't have the control of the eyes, the instinct remains. Exist, it is to capture and store prey, fresh blood is probably one of the trigger conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This speculation is quite reasonable, he thought, multi-eyed The blame is obviously not food, so the storage is still the same as the gel, which may not make much difference to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So start the weapons test as soon as possible," Roland said. "Since you have the ideal ingredients, the next step should not take much effort. The next thing you can do. Give it to the kings to do with them. After all, you also said that the chemical road is still very long. It is right to pay attention to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your Majesty." Kaimo stroked his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still have an idea." Passa said suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it?" Roland looked at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When testing weapons, you may be able to bring a special audience." She swayed the main road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland immediately realized who Pasha was referring to, "Is that guy still alive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he did not ask for more information during the chaotic period of soul integration, he did not expect to open the mouth of the higher-order devil again. It is now in the hands of the Tsinghua witch, either choose to commit suicide or tossing to death by the enemy. He thought that the other party had long since turned into a ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't have a hunger strike, as long as it is sent to food, it will eat cleanly without any leftovers." Pasha said succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
