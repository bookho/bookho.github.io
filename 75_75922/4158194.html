			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space that was originally roaring suddenly quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything in the world is like going away from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the woman in front of her eyes, Celine couldn’t help but shed tears - although this body has long had no ability to cry. She wants to hug each other and reach halfway but she stops in the air because she sees her rough tentacles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side took the initiative to approach, and did not hesitate to hold her must. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not the first to see the carrier, what are you shy about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As always The kind tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family familiar looks so that Catherine could no longer suppress the emotions. She launched all the tentacles and put Eleanor into her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now can you tell me about the beginning and the end of the matter?" the other party laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, can you tell me what's going on outside?" After a little calm, Serin remembered her mission - this space of consciousness still exists. It turns out that the god of God did not hit the ground as the enemy expected, but she still wants to hear the news of peace outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although still in the air, it should be able to reduce the speed to a safe level before the crash." Eleanor said that it was paused, "said Come back, this thing is the devil's creation? I saw a lot of gods and witches - we have been able to break into the enemy's city? Akalis, she still... succeeded..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin finally rest assured, "This...the thing is probably different from what you think, and it is estimated to take a long time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The exchange of consciousness is suitable for a long story," Eleanor said with a sigh of relief. "Come on, I am ready."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes." Catherine ordered the Lord. "Then I will start from your integration with the central carrier..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, she stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It turned out to be like this." When Eleanor spoke again, the tone was filled with emotion. "It’s not that Akaris won or won. Nataya won, but human beings reunited as a whole. But I am very curious, can there really be such a person in mortals?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It took a long time to accept this. However, Ai Gesha, who had recruited ordinary people before, adapted quickly. If it was not for her relationship, the process would be more tortuous."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember the name." Eleanor blinked. "A young genius is awakened."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still remember her," said Celine unexpectedly. "The witch who can live to the present is only the one she still has." She said he hesitated for a moment, "Eleanor, you." Can you recall what you experienced in the central carrier?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party slowly shakes his head "In fact, I don't know who I am. Eleanor's name is not accurate, because I am still Qiao Wei, Lil, Salish... All the witches who are integrated with the central carrier form the present. I can remember all the things before the fusion, but it is not the case in the center. I can hardly describe the specific feelings, chaos, chaos, not invisible, not as simple as it is, as if the consciousness was stripped into several copies, only one A small part can stay normal." She sighed and sighed. "Oh... if you really want to think about it, the only thing you can remember is the arithmetic problem and the analysis of the core of the magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you came here?" said Celine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know, it's like seeing a beam of puncturing chaos, will it run to it anyway?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that for me at the time, you are also the light in the dark...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminiscent of the process of entering here is also very smooth, it is likely to be related to the mother of the soul of Naso Pellet's transformation. Compared with the central carrier of underground civilization, this "carrier" may be more in line with their consciousness. This is not difficult to understand. After all, from the perspective of many faces displayed by the mask, its way of thinking should be complex and diverse. If it is impossible to coordinate these consciousnesses, the first one to be countered must be itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is more suitable for Eleanor, she will be "attracted" in the moment when the two are connected by magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the net disappears, she still exists, which means that the carrier without the winter city has become an empty shell, and Eleanor is currently in the devil's In the mother of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Sailing commented on her analysis, the other party agreed to nod. "I think so. I didn't expect it to be so long. It became a devil, and the ending was a bit unexpected. But the devil's maharaja, who was called a mask, was completely transformed. The ability of the body to move with a little action was not preserved. It was like deliberately. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to act means that the message cannot be passed out of the fog lake, and naturally no one will notice the change at the bottom of the obelisk. As long as the tower is still making red fog, the mother of the soul will surely be safe and sound - the facet is undoubtedly falling on the blind spot of its own people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as we know who you are, it doesn't matter how the container is." Serin swayed the main, and the voice contained an unpredictable expectation. "Others The fusion of the witch must also be because of the approval, will let you reappear in a three-seat attitude. When you return to the winter city, Pasha will be delighted!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I also want to see them," Eleanor looked into the distance. "But I can't go that far."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;赛Lynn glimpsed, "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The stone below the obelisk is nearing exhaustion and will soon be completely ineffective. The mother of the soul will follow Death is gone - again, it is also the devil, it is impossible to act freely like a carrier." She replied easily. "The last thing I can do for you is to let the city slowly land." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin suddenly froze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finds that she has forgotten a very important thing. The rising and slowing of the God of God is based on the overdraft of the stone. Just the effect of her increase in the obelisk, the use of the "net" to connect to the West, is the exhaustion of the magic that is already left. Whether the second plan of the mask is successful, it is an irreversible thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing is sad." Eleanor lowered her eyes. "Your efforts have made me see the world again, and unlike four hundred years ago, This time human beings are full of hope... this is already the biggest reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Eleanor reached out and interrupted her. "In fact, this is not a bad thing. If I don't show up, everything will be the same, but if I come back, it might bring a lot of trouble, even harmful to the situation. "Blessing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this possible?" Celine repeatedly swayed the Lord and retorted, "Everyone will only feel excited!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that the witch is now led by a mortal king, right? If he knows, there will be a three-time party in the United Front in the united front. What do you think? Who will Tacila take orders, and his opinion is the only one... even if you deny it, you can’t eliminate this suspicion. It will become a crack sooner or later. As a member of the Detective Society, you usually focus on the research of magic, and it is normal to understand these things - so the safest way is to maintain the status quo."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin didn’t know what to pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since Akalis and Nataya are behind, I understand one thing." Eleanor sighed. "I am a Above the name, it is not a qualified leader. It is an advantage for ordinary people, but it is not suitable for being a guide. In the face of the breakup of the federation, I still have not made my own choice. Essentially an escape."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
