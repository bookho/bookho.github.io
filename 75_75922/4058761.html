If you don't want to, don't force yourself."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, don't you want me to accompany you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not!" He shook his head completely differently. The cold-faced iceberg can make the action. "I want to stay with you all the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even those bitter scenes that are born and died, confide in love The lines are just like this. She thought it was a unique exaggeration expression of drama. I didn't expect to meet such people. Mey glanced at him. "Oh? Then I am with Roland, who do you want to stay with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...this," Carter For a moment, he probably never thought about how to choose duty and love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei was teased and patted his cheek. "Oh, it seems that my status is comparable to that of the king."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief knight sighed and put his wife into his arms, and his movements were not honest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! It’s still daytime," she was preparing to dispel the thoughts of the other side, suddenly a sour throat, "vomit--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter immediately stopped and asked with concern, "What happened? Is there any discomfort?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Mey shook his head, pushed the knight, and took a deep breath. Although there is no other abnormality in the body, I still feel that I have some nausea and vomiting, as if something is in my stomach. She went to the toilet and vomited twice. She couldn't spit it out except for some saliva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am going to call Miss Lily." Carter was anxious. He put on his coat and prepared to go out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait...etc," Mey stopped him. "I didn't get cold."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "But you are all like this... The textbooks in your Majesty said that the early symptoms of the cold are vomiting and diarrhea, and the ability of Miss Lily can cure the disease very quickly. The more it drags, the more serious it will be." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I may not be ill..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not sick?" Carter frowned. " Then why would you want to vomit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fool without common sense, Mei Yi floated a rosy cheek, she heard some people said, if there is... That, a great chance will produce a similar reaction. However, she has no experience with this. If she makes a mistake, isn’t she laughing at her big teeth? She is very happy to see her husband's ridiculous appearance, but she can't make a mistake in this key judgment, otherwise she will be laughed at him for a lifetime. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the Witch Alliance...I remember a green-haired woman who can see through it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You mean Miss Sylvie?" The card features nod. "She can see hidden things that ordinary people can't see...but she won't cure."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you please ask her for a trip?" Mey slowly returned to the bedroom bed, obviously just guessing, but she couldn't help but lighten her hands and feet, as if she was afraid of the things in her stomach. "Maybe Miss Sylvie can know the reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean..." Carter reacted at this time, he opened his mouth and his eyes were bright. A few points, then clenched his fists heavily. "I will go to Ms. Wendy right away. If she is in the inner city, there should be no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door was closed, Mayi spit out a sigh of relief. This feeling is really wonderful. It’s less than half an hour before and after, life is like more A meaning, just a possible opportunity to let her whole body warm. Closing her eyes, she couldn’t help but see the expression of jasmine when she handed her salted fish to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably...the taste of hope? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
