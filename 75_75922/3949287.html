			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then she picked up the sword of the trial army, stabbed Farian, and smashed another judge in half, and the blade was broken. In a few paragraphs, but the whistle sounded the entire monastery, many people came to the side with oil lamps, she took down the clothes of Farian and put on herself, picked up the weapon of another person, and came alone. The guards went."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was sitting in a bloody room for a while before I came back. One of those dead was in charge. The keys to the entrances and exits of the monastery, I pulled out the keys from the clothes scattered around, and at the same time peeled off the stone of their gods. At that time, I didn’t know the role of the stone, but I felt like a crystal clear look. I can sell the price. The priests, guards and trials of the monastery were attracted to her. I almost walked to the unknown door on the side of the backyard. I tried the key and finally opened the small door. Leaving the monastery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Later, the stone only bought One, the rest were taken away, I rely on the ten silver wolves, wandering all the way to Haifeng County to stop. Two years later, I also awakened into a witch." Wendyton paused, "This is my whole story."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale held the other’s hand and silenced for a long time before he said: "What about the woman in the ceremonial class?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe dead, maybe fleeing. I later inquired that the church said that there was a fire at the monastery and then shut it down. No one knows, no one knows. I care about where the girls go. They are all abandoned people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale sighed and held Wendy in her arms," Now you have us. Sleep, Wendy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, she gently responded, "Well..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Roland When I yawned into the office door, I saw the nightingale sitting on the table with a serious look. Waiting for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you heard of the extraordinary? She asked in a cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the prince shook his head, the nightingale retelled the story that Wendy said last night. "If it is not awakening, I can hardly imagine that a minor woman can easily Killing the heavily armed trial army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women not restricted by the stone of God's punishment..." Roland thought for a moment after listening to it, remembering his ability to give witches The category of division, "Is she a self-reinforcing witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From...What type?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took a piece of paper from the drawer and handed it to her. "I made a basic classification based on how you use magic. Strengthening your own type of witch all the time and consuming magic, transforming itself, this change is not by God. The impact of the stone of punishment. Although the physical quality of the witch is generally improved by the containment of magic, the intensive witch is more prominent. If I am not mistaken, the book should be a supernatural in the eyes of the church.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Books? "The night is stunned," but she..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she is not good at fighting, right. Roland said with a smile. "This classification is not based on strength or weakness. It is not necessarily completely correct. It is just my personal thoughts and speculations." A power-enhanced witch can indeed cause a lot of trouble for the church. Without the constraints of the stone of the gods, she can selectively intercept the trial squad or single-handedly pick up the church in the small town. However, the power of one person is limited, and the witches who are awakened to their own intensiveness are inevitably less than the other two types. Otherwise, the witches in turn chase the church. "Although he said it easily, but with the red, black and two balls, there is a kind of faint hunch in his heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extraordinary is less, this In the past 100 years, there should have been a dozen or so. In addition, if there are two or three power-strengths, the church will be disturbed. For example, in the annual demon month, the church will concentrate all its energies on Hermes. At the time of the defense line, Daoqing’s church facilities in other cities killed churches, priests, and priests. In the past few years, the church’s believers may be greatly reduced.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp However, in addition to the superb who Wendy happened to encounter, Roland never heard of a witch attacking the church, and even the monastery where Wendy was a child was covered up by a fire. The whereabouts of the woman are unknown.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
