			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland fell asleep, the night fell into the fog and left the castle quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her destination is the Diplomatic Building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness of the darkness of the night shows a distinct black and white color in the foggy world. With a twisted outline, she jumps a few meters, a few steps Passed through the courtyard wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland calls this mode of action a flash, and it is said that there is no cooldown. The nightingale liked this name for the first time - if it was lightning, if it was quiet, it would disappear, and it would be impossible to prevent it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that she doesn’t quite understand what the cooldown of the second half means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is also the old problem of Roland’s majesty. Staying with him for a long time, I can always hear some words that I don’t know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the castle area, the nightingale did not go down the ramp as usual, but leaped directly on the side of the hill, along the lines that appeared in the sky Going through the air, after a few steps, it fell directly to the top of the diplomatic building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This building is built on the middle of the castle area and the residential area. It is four stories high, just in line with the small highland where the castle is located. It is also the witch. The second concrete building after the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was originally designed to house some of the more important prisoners, such as the wife of the Duke of Ryan, and was detained in the basement - although a prisoner, The environment of the new residence is much better than the previous dungeons, and there are daily walks and winds. According to her opinion, it is cheap to help the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably because you feel that you may not have so many enemies to be under house arrest, the ground part will become the first stop for the guests who have not come to the winter city, such as Wang The Alchemists Association, the sages of the Astrology Association, and the Fjord Sea Merchants have lived here for some time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the rooms in the diplomatic building are mostly vacant, and far from the residential heating system, only tap water is available. Because the occupant's identity is more complicated, his Majesty has added a guardian team, which can show the attention of the guests and the guardianship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale naturally does not choose to walk the corridor to alarm the guard. She goes straight through the top floor and enters the bedroom where the wolf-hearted witches live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon review did not find anything different. The magical cyclones of the four witches are very stable, and the capacity is not outstanding. It is the most common one. . As for the content question and answer, there is basically no lie. Only when talking about past experiences, there is some vagueness. The subtle part of the heart is sharply captured by her branch ability - but this is normal, suffering, hunting, and even suffering along the way. More difficult to deal with, will become the shadow of the witch's unwillingness to mention, want to conceal is an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only these four witches come to the Winter City, then she is likely to have four more sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the nightingale is the ordinary woman called the 76th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no magic in the other person, and the look is no different from the average person, but she always feels that something is wrong. After recalling it, I found out that what made her feel weird was the unconcealed answer on the 76th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale has seen many people until they face death, and the bamboo baskets will usually tell what they know, and a former underground chamber maid It is rare to be honest with strangers without any threats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she can’t judge the identity of the other person for this reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, there is no lying on the 76th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No lying means that the experience and origins she talked about so far are credible. In addition, the statements of Joel, Amy and Annie can also prove each other - she is indeed a guide for the "black money" exhibition, because it was involved in the witch auction event, was bought by Joel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other party is really unwilling, this is also the time when the flaws are most likely to be revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked through a bedroom and quickly found the room where she was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other witches have basically gone to sleep, but the room on the 76th is still lit - she is sitting on the bed and playing with candlelight In the ring, I can see that her eyes are filled with joy and intoxication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it because of the beautiful jewels set on the ring? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale went to the bed and quietly looked at her every move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in addition to the over and over appreciation of the ring, there is no other suspicious behavior, like a lucky hand holding a treasure, excited to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a small magical brilliance on the ring, considering that the exhibition often auctions some ruins that do not know where to collect it, one appears It is not too strange to have such a magic stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been half an hour, until the other person appreciates tired, hanging down his arms and closing his eyes, the nightingale sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a lot of consideration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally glanced at the 76th, reached out and annihilated the candlelight, turned and walked through the wall, into the whistling snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The heat of the colorful magic stone subsided, which proves that the person using the magic has left the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy-sixth was a little relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they can get almost unlimited life through the way of soul transfer, it does not mean that they can stay up all night. Just disconnecting the soul from the body, the rest is much more efficient than sleep, so in one day, she only needs to rest for an hour or two to restore her spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, she falls asleep far later than the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, it was because of this difference that she observed an incredible scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening your eyes on the 76th, looking at the bed that is empty, just now, there was a bright orange light in the room. The light column with the thickness of the trunk is straight through the ceiling, and the other side of the ring is reflected in a golden color! This level of "key" has surpassed the high-level witch Pasha, who survived Tachair, only after the three seats of the Federation. Although she couldn't see the other person's figure, she knew that it was not a simple stealth technique, but a much more complicated ability! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the visitor be Anna or the leaves in Nana's mouth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is still a certain gap from the requirements of the winners, it can be seen that the orange light has already excited the 76th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activation of the colorful magic stone ring is very simple. As long as someone nearby is showing the ability, the magic stone can absorb a small amount of surging magic, thus showing the ability. The complexity. The concrete performance is the light beam observed by the magic stone. The thicker the light column, the more complicated the key. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more the 76th, the more excited she was, she simply walked out of the room and went to the top of the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is blowing in the face, but she can’t feel a trace of cold. If it is normal, this feeling of emptiness will only make her bored, but now She felt very excited, and she had a kind of unrestrained feeling of welcoming the wind and chasing the last glimmer of light in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise the ring to the direction of the castle - listen to Wendy’s statement, where the witch’s place of residence, now the first high-level witch has appeared, the witch Will the league give her more surprises? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is looking forward to this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this time, the change suddenly occurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
