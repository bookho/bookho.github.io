			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you here?" Cham picked up Poshan and limped to the train. "What about Xia?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has joined other people...and evacuated to the fascinating forest," Poshan smiled reluctantly. "As for me...if I don't come to help, you're afraid. I have to die here, so... are you blaming me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I am just-"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that I am not suitable for appearing on the battlefield?" She sneered in a powerless manner. "Don't forget that I am a fighting witch, cough... When you are still playing mud, I am already living for Fighting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hurts like this, and I don’t forget to criticize myself, it’s not cute at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I heard that Xia had left, and Chalm suddenly felt a lot of peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably Hank has a good time to do what he confesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the two people came back with a creeping sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham looked back and saw that the worm that was full of blood was beginning to swell again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell, no end..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly moved to the side of the carriage, Put Poshan on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I still have time to escape now." Poshan took a long breath. "Your cowardly partners have escaped." Now, let me be here, I can still--hey," she suddenly changed her face. "What do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham plate sat down, will pack The bullets in the air are pressed into the empty magazine. "Isn't this obvious? It is impossible for you to run past the evil beast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should leave me alone, run alone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have you all done this before? But in the first army, your majesty taught us To fight for ordinary people, I can't leave you as an ordinary person, let you delay the time, but you can escape alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poshan could not help but I’m not sure that I have a day that I’m classified as an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham put all the magazines beside him and leaned over the rifle. "And... the longer I block the enemy, the safer it is, so you Don't complain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not blame the militia, they are not official soldiers, the main duty is to protect the yard and the station from being stolen and stolen, They are going to deal with monsters like Hell's Fear and Beast. They are really embarrassing them. It is good to stick to it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Poshan seemed to want to say something again, and finally closed her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are coming." Cham aimed at the newly ejected beast and pulled the trigger-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The sound of the guns echoed crisply on the plains, much thinner than initially. The muzzle of the smoke is always aimed at the most threatening target, and the flexible and delicate evil beast is completely handed over to the people around you. There was no exchange between the two sides, but it formed a strange tacit understanding. This kind of trust gave him the illusion of fighting in the army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seems to have resisted for a long time, and it seems that only for a short while, due to the loss of blood, the field of vision gradually becomes blurred, and the hands and feet become more and more dull. On the contrary, Poshan, who is much heavier than him, still does not fall down. She wraps her clothes on one arm to act as a bait, and the other hand is a deadly weapon. A small evil beast like a wolf-like fox is only squatting. It is death without injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Chalm did not find too much despair on her face, her look was not like a seriously injured person, highly concentrated Attention, decisive action, and blood-stained eyebrows made Poshan very different from his impressions in memory - which also made him realize that this is what the "fighting witch" should look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new hybrid species was drilled from the worm, and the two knew it was the last moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the drama ticket..." Poshan moved back to his side, with a little bit of awkwardness in his mouth. "If you die here... I can rest assured, at least I don't have to worry about Xia being deceived by you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough... this guy is not cute at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham did not breathe a sigh. "Yeah, the most regrettable thing is you. You can only stay with me at the last minute--" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No...” she interrupted unexpectedly. “In fact, I think—”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "呜——————————"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp whistle masked her words, and then a flame blasted around the worm. The rising smoke and gravel let the evil beast temporarily stop acting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham suddenly came to the spirit, he strongly propped up his body and looked in the direction of the flute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a black armored train appearing on the rear horizon, and the top of the turret was constantly shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in the Northern Expedition that it was in the fertile plains, connecting the Heihe of each site! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shakes Poshan excitedly, "Is it! It is the Heihe River - our reinforcements are here!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter did not give him any reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey..." Cham slammed his head and saw that the other person had closed his eyes and slipped softly to the side of the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake up, feed, wake up to me!" But no matter how he shakes, Poshan doesn't open his eyes again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been two days after seeing each other again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is her room, do you need me to knock on the door for you?" asked the keeper of the sleeping charm, Camilla. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, thank you, I will come by myself." Cham quickly bowed to the other side. This is the first time he went to the Witch's residence to visit - this does not allow outsiders to enter and exit at will, only the invitees of the residents can enter, he is also holding a try mentality, did not expect to get consent soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please pay attention to the time." Camilla nodded and then turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham took a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought it was quite embarrassing when he thought of the situation two days ago. Until now, the training of medical staff is still in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She didn't break her breath, you can shake it down like this, maybe you will shake her to death! Really, obviously people who have been on the battlefield, I don't know if it is easy to cause disengagement after a strong breath. It is easy for the railway soldiers to receive training for emergency treatment. Just know how to yell, isn't she a very important person?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham quickly slammed his head and forced these disgusting memories to be dispelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, after knowing that Poshan is still alive, he doesn’t have to rush to see each other. After all, from the outside, it’s hard to tell who is visiting who is at the moment. ——He has a bandage everywhere, and it hurts when he moves. It is a bit embarrassing. Hearing, he always felt that if he didn't take a look at himself, he couldn't let go of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, he reached out and knocked on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door is open and it’s the sight . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It really is you." She smiled happily. "When she received the notice from Master Kamila, she had not said her name yet, I guess It’s yours. Thank you for saving Poshan!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
