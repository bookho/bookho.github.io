			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning shuttles through the hilly areas south of Bianbu Town, filling the parchment paper with plaids in one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is her latest new assignment, working with Soroya to draw a map of the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Soroya flying together, the height will drop greatly and it will be difficult to cross the forest. Therefore, she first draws a rough outline, and then Soloya put together to draw a whole map. In the magic of the pen, the map looks just like the view from the sky, every detail is vivid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the parchment is filled, the lightning turns back to the border town. In the practice of these months, her flight speed is getting faster and faster. If she is flying at full speed, according to the calculation method of His Royal Highness, the speed is almost 120 kilometers per hour. At this speed, the strong wind from the pavement made her almost unable to open her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought it was the limit she could reach, but just the day before yesterday, His Highness gave her a gift - it was a cowhide stitch The headband is covered with two copper rings in the middle. The copper ring is embedded with pure transparent glass on one side. As long as it is worn, it can be far away from the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highness said that this is called windproof glasses, which was made when the glassware was fired. It is said that it is more like a small Izelel. Lightning doesn't know who Izelel is, but she understands that it is a lot of effort to join the leather, the copper ring and the lens together. Each piece of leather has a double-layer stitching, and the inward side of the copper ring is tightly wrapped. There is no need to worry about scratching the skin. There is also a buckle similar to the belt at the back. You can adjust the tightness at will. It doesn't look like it is like What you can do casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately fell in love with this gift, wearing it on her head almost at sleep. Nowadays, as long as she pulls off the windproof glasses, she can think how fast it can fly, no need to worry about the wind blowing in her ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, the lightning reached the town and was about to return to the castle to hand over the map to Soroya. A white figure suddenly swept from the corner of the eye. Over. She looked around and saw that a pigeon was spreading its wings and gliding in the direction of the long song fortress. The pigeon is not a rare bird, but it is only different. It is too fat, and the pair of wings is enough for one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning swallowed, she remembered that when she was on a desert island, she caught fish and caught birds, and set up a campfire to eat. Although the food provided by His Royal Highness is also very rich, but the buttery bread and mushroom soup for a month have been a bit greasy. If you can catch the pigeons to roast... She touched the small bag with salt and pepper at the waist. Determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One turn, the lightning rushed straight toward the pigeons, and the latter quickly noticed the uninvited guest. It gathered its wings and swooped down, seemingly trying to get into the woods and get rid of the stalkers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning a little, I didn’t expect this pigeon to be quite smart. Then she grinned and turned sharply, followed by it. Since tempting the mixed species of evil beasts in the evil month, the little girl is confident that nothing can escape under her nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pigeons pass over the treetops for a while, and the height will be extremely low, flying against the ground, but the distance between the two is getting shorter and shorter, no matter How can it flap the wings and it is impossible to break the lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woods are moving backwards, but the sun shines through the dense branches, and the spots and shades alternate, until they pass through an open section, and the surroundings suddenly become empty. Bright. She seized the opportunity, lifted the speed to the limit, and immediately hugged the pigeon from behind, and pushed it to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pigeon struggled and could not break her bondage. When lightning pulled the knife from the waist and prepared to seal the prey, the other party suddenly opened. "Don't be jealous!" Help!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl took a nap and scared almost to throw the knife away. But she quickly returned, "Are you a witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pigeon nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought I could change the taste," Lightning sighed regretfully, taking back the knife. "My name is lightning, what is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party swells into a group, then turns into a human form, "Mc茜, you actually want to eat a bird!" She complained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
