			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, No Winter City ushered in the fourth holiday after the fall, and it was the first weekend of Zhongqiu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the world doesn’t have any legends like Genesis, for most people, they have to be busy all the time to fill their stomachs. . Since Roland’s promulgation of the seven-day break, the people have put this gratitude on his head – able to take a day off and not deduct the salary. What kind of picky is the lord of kindness and love? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the displaced people who moved from the field, experienced the living environment without the winter city, they all settled down here, even the municipality The hall’s hype about the devil did not stop the momentum – even the hunger and the poor, even the threat of the devil became less important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the report of Barov shows that after the official opening of the rest day system, the production situation without the winter city has not been affected too much. The main reason is that rest is not mandatory, and there are many people who choose to continue working and earn extra compensation. However, the city’s trade behavior has grown substantially. On weekends, the square area is always overcrowded. Not only the local merchants, but even the foreign traders are swaying. They choose to open the sale on this day and spend the rest of the time on the acquisition. Western products featured and resold to other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week-based cargo flow was unimaginable a year ago, but now with the growing number of cement ships, the rhythm of trade has become Getting faster and faster. Like the inland big city of Chishui City, you can even eat fresh sea fish that are made from the port of Shoal and immersed in ice. In the past, the nobility and merchants there could only eat salted and dried fish. In view of this, Roland simply put the major publicity, achievements, and various awards ceremonies on the rest day, and furthered by the habits of the masses. Promote the activeness of commercial trade - the so-called wool out of the sheep, the overpaid pay can be recovered from the sale of taxes and consumption, it is a multi-pronged strategy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weekend is no exception, the warmth of the summer has not yet dispersed, the cloudless blue sky is blowing the breeze, obviously it is a good trip. the weather. On the street, people are moving, from the river dock area to the north wall of the city, you can see the people waiting for you everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference is that they are not buying a few pounds of good meat to go to the convenience market, but waiting to witness the new invention of His Majesty the King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unprecedented delivery vehicle - the first test run of the "train". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jeweler Victor is also one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning about the propaganda of the town hall, he even threw a big deal that he was talking about to the subordinates, and even caught up with the old king. To the cement ship without winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a strong touch on the changes in the West in these years, Victor is undoubtedly one of them. When he was still a remote town, he visited the landlord. For the person in charge, he did not leave much impression. He only remembered that he was a middle-aged aristocrat with a bloated body. He complained about his own management of this barren land. If it is not occasional to get one or two pieces of fine gemstone from the other hand, he is estimated to stop at the long song fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, Victor is the most visited in the West, and no matter when he comes, this border town is almost the same as the previous year. Dilapidated and decaying. However, in the past three years, he has come here more frequently, especially after Roland Wimbledon announced the establishment of the city, basically reached the level of once a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort Westland seems to be another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, one day is no longer a day, but a month; the same month is no longer a month, but a year, otherwise he is difficult to explain Why can't the winter city change quickly reach this point? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor walked into a street-facing pub, and the boss immediately smiled and greeted him. "I knew you would come, deliberately to stay on the third floor." A seat by the window."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out a silver wolf and threw it at the other party, "Take me up."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, please come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people around are already talking about the show today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The narrow street is the way the train will go? It’s too far from the central square and the residential area."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Street? Nothing to know, it is called the track system, the things used in the mining area." Then someone laughed and said, "Since it is not for people, of course, it is far from people." One point, do you think the train is a carriage!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you mean by the shop in the silver mine hole?”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it was originally produced here and needs to be used with a steam engine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor couldn’t help but join in the fun "I have seen the trailers driven by steam engines. The advantage is that they don't care about the terrain. If you put them on the ground, the Hummer can replace them. This is just the case. The City Hall should not promote it as an "trans-transportation tool." Right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It may be just a gimmick. "The other person muttered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go," there was a buzzing sound immediately around, "Have you come to the Winter City for the first time?" Roland’s majesty can never boast of this aspect of Haikou. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was convinced that he still wanted to say something more, and there was a whistling whistle in the distance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;“呜——————————————”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Come on, it’s coming! The room suddenly boiled up, and everyone would look out of the window and look at the small street on one side of the castle area. Some of the preparers had also taken out the lookout from their arms.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor also looks at the source of the sound-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a black long dragon slowly occluded from the house After driving out, it shines into the eyes of everyone. Its size is huge, its head is like an iron bucket on the wheel, and the top of the bucket is sprayed out of the gray smoke, which is exactly the same as when the steam engine is running.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And next to the front of the car, there is a four-wheeled carriage in parallel - the carriage is pulled by two horses, the speed is the same as the train, it looks like it is in the contest However, it is quite difficult for every step of the horse to be filled with a box of ore. This can be seen from the fact that the driver is constantly waving the whip. If the iron casting wheel is not used, the car may have been crushed. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the train gradually showing the whole picture, dimension I can’t help but feel the goose bumps behind me.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one car after another behind the front of the car, they almost all have four or five carriages, and inside It is also filled with ore. From the weight point of view, I am afraid that it is comparable to a riverboat sailing exclusively for transportation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that it Several train compartments!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exclamation of people is endless!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four...fourth Alone! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there still not to be there? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The god is on, six! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Come out, the seventh! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of a monster is dragging the entire seven trains, passing through the open space in front of the castle at an extremely steady speed.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are answers to questions in Victor's mind.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A steam engine that is fixed at the mine entrance and that specifically pulls in and out of the mine car, and A steam engine capable of autonomous operation is completely different concepts.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter means that as long as the rail is built, it can take a large shipment Where to go. Weight is no longer a bottleneck for land transportation. On the contrary, it is more powerful than shipping. If you are willing, he can even evacuate a city in a short time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
