			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book scroll holds a large stack of information on the third floor of the castle, and in front of the office, it encounters a nightingale that is yawning and ready to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still asleep?" The latter stopped and picked his eyebrows in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably older, I can't sleep lately." The book smiled and shook his head. "Hello, is he already asleep?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, he went back to the bedroom half an hour ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then you are still in the office "She said, "Isn't it going to steal the snacks?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...ah haha," the night is a little bit Then coughed twice. "Yes, I ate his spicy beef wire and stole two chaotic drinks. Don't tell your majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; This time it’s the turn of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to her... Actually, it was so simple. As long as the nightingales were not caught on the spot, they never admit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when I think that I and Wendy often touch her drink, the book will not know what to pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That, I went to sleep first..." The night vision opened and went to the second floor. "You don't want to be too late, I listen to Roland. The older the sequelae of sleep deprivation, the bigger the sequelae." She looked up at the bottom of the stairs, "Good night."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Good night." The book was somewhat inexplicable. Then I turned and walked into the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the flame of the fireplace has been extinguished, the residual temperature of the heating is still there, and there seems to be some faint fragrance in the air. It seems that the nightingale stayed here for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer think about it, the book is skilled to open the bookcase, put the data in the hand into the processing column, and then take the information to be answered. come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a string of extremely long calculations, from the perspective of Roland’s, Anna and Celin. One of her daily tasks is to bring this information to the arithmetic school, let the astrologers calculate the answer, and then check it with the central carrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the textual description, these things should be related to the new experiment. It’s just that she doesn’t understand at all, why is it only on paper that can determine the size of a device that no one has ever seen or even imagined. It seems that the paper is not a number, but a sketch of reality, which in her view is no different from predicting the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever I saw Anna Juan’s notes, the book couldn’t help but sigh. This girl born in Bianbu Town has already reached a state where they can’t The realm of understanding. It is clear that everyone was sitting in this office from the beginning, and watching the interesting science experiments done by His Majesty, anyone can plug in one or two sentences. And now I can still follow my side, but only Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she did not feel any loss in her heart, and some were just full of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——Because that is her sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book sits at Roland’s desk and flips through the information as usual, with the intention of remembering them all. In this way, she can find out in a timely manner even if there are omissions or omissions in the distribution calculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time she noticed something different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am this... dazzling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book squinted and found After some expressions, a string of characters faintly flutters, as if it were the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is an assessment paper, or a household registration file, it is not surprising. Ever since she mastered the quick search tips, she often saw where the file came from and what it was related to at the first glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only do the meaning books that the arithmetic formulas represent cannot be understood, but even the "answers" that flutter behind are not clear, so it is difficult to understand them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not every formula has a similar quirky symbol, and most of the columns are still blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you stare at the illusory symbols for a long time, you may even feel dizzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the nightingale is right, too much staying up late has an impact. The book sighed slightly, but recently the sleepiness has not been high, just as the brain is always running at high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to let the hospital open a sleeping fern tomorrow, she can't help but think that this thing has little side effect on the witch, and taking it once or twice should have no effect. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After recollecting all the information, the book suddenly felt a strong sense of dizziness hitting the heart, and even the consciousness was somewhat awkward. When the body involuntarily leaned forward, the pen holder placed on the table was also dropped by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this dizzy feeling is going too fast, and just a short amount of interest, she feels that she has returned to normal, let alone any discomfort The thoughts seem to be much clearer than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book squinted and confirmed that he did not get in the way, and smiled and bent down to pick up the pen holder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she was covered in thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the appearance of the floor... changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The office underneath is a scene she will never remember correctly. The floor is pine from the forest, covered with a layer of wool carpet, although the appearance is slightly Obsolete, but your Majesty has never been replaced. Now the carpet at the foot is still a wool carpet, but the floor in the distance has changed the material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From wood to stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book carefully raised his head and a heart continued to sink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than just the floor, the entire office seems to have changed. The loungers where the nightingales are sitting disappeared without a trace. Instead, they were replaced by a row of old iron. The file cabinet, at first glance, looks a bit like an archive in the Executive Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she must have been in the castle before! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, floor to ceiling window! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the most desirable decoration of your majesty, and the hallmark of the office. As long as you look out, you can see the winter city under the lights of the night—<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book scrolled back and pulled the velvet curtains behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that caught the eye was a gray brick wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that this is not the office of His Majesty the King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up in a panic and stunned, hitting the wall and knocking twice, the wall was not moving - it could be heard from the calm echo, obviously Not an illusion, but a real entity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book felt a trace of despair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever is suddenly transferred to a completely closed strange land, I am afraid that there will be strong helplessness and vulnerability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... She took a deep breath and forced herself to calm down. Completely closed is not accurate, there is an inconspicuous iron gate at the corner of the two rows of file cabinets. It is almost a color with the cabinet, and it is easy to ignore if you don't look carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be the only exit for the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does the iron gate lead? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you waiting for her trap or another wall? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
