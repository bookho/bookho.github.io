			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you hurry up?" Lightning flies by the cab, and I can't wait to get on the train myself - but she knows it. This behemoth is like a mountain, so that the wheat can be pushed, and it does not play any role at all. "How about adding more coal to the stove?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, little girl, if the pressure is too high, the boiler will blow up!" The manipulating the Heihe is a gray-haired old man. It doesn't look like a soldier. It looks like an ordinary and awkward neighbor. He Pulling the scorpion back, "Reassure, the First Army is not so easy to be defeated, even if the opponent is the devil in hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning Grinning, no answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing that getting the train to this speed is beyond expectation, it still does not reduce the anxiety in her heart - following the railway to find the Heihe River It takes too much effort, after all, it’s hard to make such a striking large machine want to be overlooked. In addition to scaring the people in the car and jumping, the rest of the process went smoothly: with the identity of the Witch Alliance, the train conductor quickly believed her words and issued a U-turn command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the lightning can't relax at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the train turns to Tower 1, she finally contacted Sylvie, and the latter’s news made her sink: the devil not only accurately caught The gap between the advancement of the First Army initiated a sudden attack in the absence of defense, and the main force of the attack was rapidly approaching the camp from both directions. Without the support of artillery, it would be even harder to play a competitive position, and the situation will undoubtedly worsen the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hearing this, she really can't be as confident as the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only good news is that McMug has successfully found the injured Luo Jia, with the treatment of Nana Wa, the life of the wolf woman is finally unaffected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The outside is noisy and big, do you want to come in and sit down? Every word has to shout and say it is not easy." The other took a pipe, relying on To the window, "Don't look at some of the people inside, at least warm - this stove is much better than the fireplace!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...thank you "The lightning looked at the bridge like a sieve, and shook his head. "It’s still not needed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, this is the limit of the Heihe . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to accelerate according to this jitter frequency, even if the boiler can come over, the train must not fall apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be seen that you are still worried about the situation there...Do you have any relatives or friends in the camp?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Lightning replied with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have it too," he said with a beard. "And there are two!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey?" Lightning couldn't help but glimpse. She thought that the other party was calm because she was not worried about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I used to be a miner. I have had four children in my life. Except for the boss who died in a cold, everyone else lived under Wimbledon. Arrived." The old man smiled. "Before they used to be like a mouse. They were small and weak, but since they joined the army, they have changed like a person inside and outside. This is why I am full of confidence in the First Army. - A team of such people cannot be easily defeated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes... is this? Lightning couldn't help but ask, "Is there another one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On this train," he knocked on the pipe, "the first I found out that you are close to the lookout."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man paused for a moment, and he was quite proud in his tone. "Because these changes are all under the Wimbledon belt Come, so I also thought about what I could do for him. Besides, it’s boring to stay alone in the mine. It’s better to walk around. Later, I chose the train team from the people who are familiar with the operation of the steam engine. I signed up. I didn't expect to be chosen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original is not hers...Lightning screamed, ready to say something, console The phone on the phone suddenly sounded loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
