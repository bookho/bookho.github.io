			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The prince actor is quite handsome, but his expression is too stiff," Margaret said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, it’s actually him," Roland said with a slight surprise. "Dawn dawn, the first knight in the West, is now a teacher in Bianbu Town. Not an actor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not an actor?" The businesswoman is awkward. "Can that still come to power?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There is limited manpower," he smiled. "You look at the other two, the actors who used to carry the scene props. If they played the prince, it’s really... it’s not like it’s gray. The girl who fell in love at first sight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...you are also speaking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Change The costumed Irene stood by and watched Mey walk to the side of Film Hill, put his hand on his shoulder and danced with him - no, the film wouldn't dance, he was just superb by Mey. Guided by the dance technique, shaking with the pace of the other party. This paragraph did not appear in the rehearsal, Irene realized that this is the impromptu performance of Mey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister seduce the prince, but the prince is unmoved, just keep polite and talk to him until Cinderella appears in front of the prince. To this woman with a bright tooth and a beautiful woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene knows that as soon as he walks, the film will take Mey to the side according to the script. I have a love story that I fell in love with at first sight. However, anyone can see that the appearance of his own embarrassment is no longer attractive than that of Mey. Why should the prince leave her more beautiful and moving, and choose ordinary Self? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she saw the eyes that film sent to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is helplessness, comfort, encouragement, and...love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene felt that the stage was suddenly quiet, the laughter, voices and arguments of the townspeople were gone, the friends of the theater were gone, and only the stage was left. Lower Mey, film and himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, she’s far from the West Star in her acting skills, so give up and admit defeat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Irene’s voice is whispering in her heart, no, she wants to play, this is her rare opportunity, or... the last chance, If she gives up, she will probably not encounter such an opportunity again, and she can compete with such an outstanding female protagonist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also wants to be a person like Mey, and the gestures can drive the atmosphere of the audience, so that everyone's focus is on themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, Mey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the prince is a theater actor, she is hard to come up with the courage to compete. It is almost impossible for her to rely on acting to defeat the Star of the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he is not. He is dawning, my lover, Irene thinks, please forgive me for playing, I don't want to lose to you in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stage disappeared, Irene was in front of a field of wheat, golden wheat ears were ripe, hanging down, gently swaying with the evening wind, waiting for people to pick . In the distance, you can see the sunset that falls into the horizon, and put a layer of warm color on the slowly flowing Chishui River. This is where they often rendezvous. In the red-orange sunset, the prince turned back to the knight, who had fallen in love with each other long ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he blooms his most beautiful side in front of him, he can keep his eyes from moving away...not acting, but real self, Irene Bring up the robes that are in the way, tie a knot and walk to the film. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence returned to her heart, everything is so natural, she walked to the knight, she smiled at Mey, and the latter unconsciously let go of him Hand on the shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I dance with you?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not as skilled as Mayi, under her guidance, the Cavaliers jumped more naturally than before. The tacit understanding of the two people infected the audience. Everyone began to applaud, whistle, and then four cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;喧哗I brought Elin back to the stage again, she picked up her foot, kissed the prince’s cheek, then pushed him away and ran to the backstage. . At the same time, the thick bells rolled over the square, and the distant mountains came with a vague echo, no more than a dozen. It was twelve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the drama is coming to an end, and it’s the final ** of the whole show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince’s search for a house in the outer city finally came to the home of Cinderella, and the little girl at this time had put on a dirty gray robe and held it. The broom was pushed aside by my sister. The older sister is still beautiful and can wear the crystal shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Your Highness, what are you still hesitating, I am the one you are looking for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, she is not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...you shut me up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Although Meiyi’s performance is not inferior to the previous one, and even stronger in the sense of oppression, Irene no longer cringes, she walks out from the corner, step by step to the center of the stage, and looks directly at the other side, showing unyielding And the look of resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of them are applauding for this wonderful scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the witch suddenly appeared, she reached out and let Cinderella put on the party dress again -<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, she is the person you are looking for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Xia pulled off the gray robes of Irene. Exposed to the evening dress below, almost at the same time, her hair was swayed. After the shun, the Cinderella who took the prince's heart once again appeared in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere of the audience was instantly exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people boiled under the hugs of the prince and Cinderella, and the sound of salute sounded at the right time to push the atmosphere to its peak. The long-awaited applause and cheers continued to form, until the ending whispered, the actors quit, and everyone did not stop applauding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is really wonderful," Margaret claped. "I thought the little girl would be overwhelmed by Mey. I didn't expect her to end." I can pull it back, and I don’t know if it’s an illusion. Her interaction with the prince is more natural than that of Mey, just like... she really should be with the prince.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It's really surprising," Roland nodded. Behind Irene's back was a personal change, it should be a true performance, so she can maintain confidence in Mayi's aggressiveness. In a short period of time, changing the prince back to his husband and getting rid of the shackles of the stage is also very good. In time, she must be a rising star. In addition, the echo and the salute sound made by the echo are also perfect. Since there is no rehearsal, Roland just told her to play freely before the drama began. I didn't expect the effect to surprise him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost, Mayi closes his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried her best to let the prince’s male horn be played by film hilt, who wanted to leave him on the stage he was best at. deep impression. In the way of defeating Irene completely, I showed him in this way, the gap between Irene and myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, she did not hesitate to stay in the town for nearly a week, and some of the actors who usually do not look at her eyes are rehearsing drama. Delayed for such a long time, I am afraid that now back to the long song fortress, the theater owner can not be as hot as before. And the most ridiculous thing is that she did not completely defeat Irene even on the stage. She lost not the other's acting, but the other's love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, it is time to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei took a deep breath, changed his clothes and took the lead to leave the preparation room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
