			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of the two should make the non-relay communication reach about 100 kilometers, which can cover most of the living areas in the West, and can also make no Winter City is always ready to get the battle situation on the desperate mountain line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to extend it, you must use a signal amplification device. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Roland chose to develop a wired phone, in addition to Anna’s words aroused his ambition, the phone itself is indeed a very versatile High tools, whether it is to control the political situation, strengthen centralization, or help the war command are significant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another more important point is that the current industrial project without Winter City has reached saturation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New immigrants need to be digested after primary education, and the four giant industries of civil engineering, mineral smelting, mechanical processing and chemical production have occupied nine It is no more difficult to get into the above qualified workers, and in terms of their size and expected scale, it will be difficult to swallow the six or seventy-seven people who have joined the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these industries are closely related to the future war, no one can suffer the Big Four. The most typical one is the bicycle factory. This Roland plant was originally built with great enthusiasm. The bicycles produced so far are not enough for the first army. When the power is insufficient, the first one must be shut down. When the manpower is in short supply, all the workers have to go to the steam engine factory to work overtime. It can be said that it is a long way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the Kingdom Road and Highway 67 are built, the road runs basically a carriage - all from the Changge District or other cities. Because there is no horse in the border area, there are no supporting facilities such as horse stables. Seeing that the railroad tracks have begun to be laid, the scenes of the citizens who are happy to ride bicycles to and from the two places still do not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Roland will never admit in front of Barov that this is his decision-making mistake, but now when considering the new facility, he will pre-empt the winter city without Production potential is taken into account. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone is just a good tool that takes almost no production potential and does not require manual maintenance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it will not be put into the civilian market. Whether it is military contact or connecting the border area and the long song area, Roland is only going to adopt one-on-one approach. Laying cables. In this way, the wiring process is eliminated and no complicated wire mesh is required. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, very few quantities mean that they can be produced by Anna, Mystery and Soroya in their leisure time, with little need to divert urban productivity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the tossing of the tube, it is not too late to develop civilian communications. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the wired telephone is the most suitable project for research and development in front of the Daqishan Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of the phone prototype is even better than Roland expected, by the afternoon Two simple magnet phones appeared in the backyard of Beipo Mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has no outer casing and looks like a combination of bare coils and magnets, equipped with a hand-cranked generator, with a magnetic Battery "Twilight Mini". Since the amount of power required is not large, the magnetic battery with a finger thickness can last for at least a month, and he does not intend to dry the battery alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you use this?" Mystery Moon curiously said, "Is my ability really so amazing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland automatically ignores the latter half of the sentence, "It's very simple, optimistic... This hand-cranked motor is responsible for sending out the call signal when the user shakes it quickly-" he grabs the handle and rotates hard, The other end of the magnetic ring suddenly sounded "clam", "At this time, it means there is a telephone access."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he made an appointment to Anna Look, the latter nodded and picked up the handset and microphone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the handset leaves the pedestal, the switch pops up, meaning that the voice line is turned on, and you can talk at this point. The current that delivers the electrical signal is dimmed The mini number is provided, so there is no such copper rod for the mystery month. The phone can only ring and cannot make a sound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, can I try to use it to speak?" Soloya eagerly tried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And me," Bell raised his hand high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course no problem... you are the maker of it, and naturally qualified to be the first to experience this epoch-making communication tool." Roland laughed. Needless to say, the meaning of the telephone has completely changed the communication habits of human beings and closely linked the distant world. It is not an exaggeration to praise. "It’s just a short distance from the yard, the signal will hardly decay, with ordinary copper. The lines are connected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a clear ringing sound in this quiet place surrounded by the white jungle. It is obvious that you can talk directly, but everyone has to repeat it, starting with hand-cranked power generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is really a voice!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like Lucia!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what should I say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let her guess who you are! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches screamed at the microphone across the wall, and for a time, laughter echoed at both ends of the yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also listened twice. To be honest, the effect of the prototype is not ideal, the sound is too big and small, and there are so many noises that you can’t A qualified finished product. However, he knows that the next step is to adjust the reed size and the distance between the electromagnets repeatedly to make the call quality the best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the microphone was once again passed to Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head with a smile, put the earpiece around his ear, habitually opening the door, "Hey?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the weak current interference there, no one answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost as a heart and soul, he subconsciously guessed the person on the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna...?" Roland whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, there was a slightly distorted answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like you...Roland."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;********* **********<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the day's protection, the nightingale returned to the bedroom with some sullenness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of not understanding anything is not the first time. At this time, only the dried fish and ice cream bread can comfort her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔... Now there are more chaotic drinks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the intimate appearance of Roland and Anna, she feels sincere envy and faint heart. I thought I would adapt sooner or later, but this process is more difficult than she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How deep is the relationship, how long the thorns will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She now understands what Wendy is saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walked to the table, the nightingale opened the drawer, only to find that the bottle was empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened the drawer on the other side, still a bottle of empty bottles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wenty? My Chaos..." The nightingale just turned and was held in her arms by the roommate. The proud chest almost let She can't breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Night, how many years have we known? Since you left the Quinn family in Silver City, you are with me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah... almost four or five years, but my chaos..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
