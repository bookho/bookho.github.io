			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the evil month is not over, the streets of the fortress are always cold and clear, and even the ubiquitous mice are shrinking and hiding in their own eyes. In the light of the site, the food stored in the fall is eaten, waiting for the new prey that appears after the warming up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should have been the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom, why do I have to risk the snow and listen to what policy preaching? Snake teeth spit in the ground and spit in the ground, the things that the great masters want to do, have nothing to do with our fart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put the collar up," he looked at the short man who shivered around him. "Infected with the cold, you are not saved."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He shouldn’t come out with us at all," Kwai frowned. "Inquired about a message, which needs four people? This is Kanash is targeting us." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Save it, even if it's targeted," the most powerful tiger claws don't take it for granted. "He can hold our food source." That being said, he still walked two steps, blocking the front of the three, and the snakes felt that the cold wind was much smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you...thank you," Joe whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when it comes to Kanash, everyone can’t afford it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also grades in the mouse, from the top king to the bottom of the bottom, occupying different sections. Kanash is neither a king nor a tail. He is the manager of Wuwei Lane in the West End of the Outer City. To be counted down, it should be considered waist...or belly. But no matter what the other party is, snakes and other people will be respectful and screaming at the boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a manager has a total of six in the Western District. As for the boss above, the king of the Western District, the snake tooth has never seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanas has several groups of rats, and they are one of them. There is no doubt that the stronger the strength, the more favored managers are. Unfortunately, as the street children in the alley, their numbers are not thin, even the fight, the arms and legs are finer than the other side, born to be inferior - of course, except the tiger claws, his body is fundamental It’s not like eating half a piece of brown bread a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the brown-haired girl, the target is even worse. There was a witch in the alley, and the snake tooth wanted to use her ability to change some coins. I didn't expect to go out and hit the big man in the elk family. As a result, the money did not earn much, and even the witch was lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this break, Kanash was particularly annoyed at several of them, thinking that if he handed over the witch to him earlier, whether it was sold to aristocrats or sold Giving the church is a better choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will talk about it," Snakes dismissed. "Sell to the church for twenty-five golden dragons? Where is he going to find those gods?" The priests and churches have all become ruins. The nobility will not honestly hand over the golden dragon to a mouse. He has no life to get the money."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Snakes said, it’s right," Joe said with a trembling voice. "If it’s true, it’s our reason for him to lose and lose twenty-five golden dragons. He has long put us The body was thrown into the Chishui River."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kanasch at most dared to hand over the witch to the king of the Western District, but also to guard against the unpredictable ability of the witch. He has no stone of punishment." Snakes continued, "The guy just saw that we are not pleasing to the eye."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What bought and bought, she It’s white paper, it’s a group with us!” Kwai took a snake’s tooth. “You still want to treat her as a cargo!” She said that suddenly she had a meal here. “Hey, you won’t put it at the time. "Sell it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't have it!" he muttered. "At the time I was dead to protect her, but the other is the city owner!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if she is doing well in Bianbu Town," the tiger claw sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How good can you be," Kwai snorted. "What is the difference between being played by a prince and being played by a nobleman?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes... It’s good to say, wait until you have seen the aristocratic life, I’m afraid there are big nobles to play with you, snakes and mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
