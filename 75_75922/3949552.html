			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the winter, the heavy snow has subsided a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stared at the little song and looked at the three manuscripts on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are new ammunition trial production and production plans, a new generation of light weapons stereotypes and a mage tower construction project. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two are his long-conceived products. Now with Aegusa's refrigeration temperature control, the town's nitric acid production is greatly increased, nitrification * glycerol The stability of scale production has also been solved, and it has basically met the conditions for manufacturing double-base hair injection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although knowing that this type of emission* drug dissolves nitrocellulose into nitric acid* glycerin, it eventually gives a viscous gel that can be sliced ​​or granulated, but The ratio also needs the alchemist to slowly test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Camo Spoel is now very skilled in quantitative and qualitative testing. If this task is given to him, it should be able to be in a week or two. got the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the production of new hair-emitting drugs, the development of new light weapons naturally has to be on the agenda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the large-caliber wheel rifle used in black powder, the double-base emission* medicine requires only a small amount of material to achieve equivalent lethality, so In terms of comprehensive power and cost performance, the conversion of new rifles into small-caliber automatic weapons is an inevitable choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, its specific parameters will be further determined based on Anna's processing results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland drank a hot tea and placed the third manuscript in front of him - this is what he is currently most interested in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of this document looks very uncoordinated compared to the plan that I have done before - at the request of Ai Gesha, he intends to A mage tower was built on the side for the research and manufacture of the seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it, a chimney and a factory with a tower of magic towers, this feeling is simply... fashionable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but laugh out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a white eye on the nightingale with the dried fish. "Is it so interesting? The witch kingdom has a lot of prints, but it still loses to the end." The devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But there are some very interesting things inside," the prince took a thick book from the drawer - it was left from the Quest The test notes translated in the test notes, which contains all the recipes that the Quest will get for more than two hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, this is a completely new continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the translation of Ai Gesha, Roland spent almost all of his time on the book, looking at the list of uses and combinations of the magic stone. It's like being in the language of assembling runes. When the chief alchemist got the "Elementary Chemistry", he was excited and excited to read the chemical formulas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the knowledge that I have never seen before, even if it is just fur, it will be extraordinarily attractive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example?" The nightingale leaned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like this," Roland pointed to the previous page of the book. "The ancient witch called it a hearing, which can be used for long-distance communication, similar to tracking marks. Once made, the separation can also produce an effect.” His fingers moved down. “The material is also very simple, only a piece of echo stone and a marker stone.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; According to the description of the book, this kind of printing distance is up to several tens of miles. Although it is not comparable to the mobile phones supported by the signal towers and satellites in later generations, it is enough to be used as a short-distance walkie-talkie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" The Nightingale probe glanced at his eyes and reached out and pointed his finger to the right page. "But here it is written," the echo stone comes from Heart fear, mark stone is common in the devil camp. How do you get these two magic stones? "No, the material we already have," Roland said with great enthusiasm. "The red spar that lightning found in the remains of the stone tower is an echo stone." As for the marking stone, it is also a component of the tracer's printing - such a signature Terry carries a number of groups, just open a copy. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
