			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new "Sleep Charm" is not a single building, but a residential area covering an area of ​​about 7,000 square meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a new residential area, it is not only equipped with self-flowing water and heating, but also a four-story frame house with mature concrete pouring technology. The building is exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Roland has also built a two-story conference hall in the middle of the community for the activities of the Sleeping Island witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the first night of the arrival of the migrants to the Winter City, the welcome banquet was held here, and after a lapse of half a month, once again in the hall Gathered with witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the eyes of the public, Tilly walked onto the podium and began to read the recruitment order from Roland Wimbledon and a new compensation system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The arrangement of the work is now like this, the income created by the witch, the sleeping spell can get 30% of it. The money will be used to improve everyone's life. And expand the scale of the curse, and all the aspects that need to be used in the future." The five kings smiled and talked. "At first glance, I seem to have been exploited by my brother. After all, when the island is sleeping, the commission paid by the fjord merchants belongs to us. I own everything. But in fact, the other side will take the opportunity to propose a lot of additional conditions, such as buying their food and living materials at a high price, etc., often get a discount, but there are not so many additional conditions."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, Roland’s 30% has exceeded the income of the Sleeping Island in terms of number. In addition, most of the new work content only needs to consume magic, and does not have to go to the unknown seas in person. Adventure, so it is much easier. The two can conclude that I am not the one who is being exploited, or even the cheaper brother."<br /><br />&nbsp; & Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence caused a low sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But!" Tilly suddenly raised her voice. "These are not related to the rewards I have to say. What was the salary paid by the Fiordland merchants before, for Anything that lacks the sleeping charm can only be used in a unified manner, so what is finally sent to everyone is only a uniform distribution of bread, cotton, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "But this time everyone will get a real return, not a series of invisible and intangible numbers. As for how to control them, it is personal freedom. Now, please open the envelopes on their desks."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly has long noticed this envelope with the mark of the Grey Fort Tower, but has been resisting not touching it, and now hears the request of His Royal Highness, she I couldn’t wait to tear open the seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... the new Quint card?" The shadow sitting on the side stretched out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have it, go see yourself." Morel leaned over and held the other's gaze behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The envelope contains a piece of palm-sized paper, clearly It looks smooth and sleek, but it feels bumpy and can be easily bent without leaving creases like plain paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Molly saw it at first sight, he liked the piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a piece of art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the size is similar to the popular Quent card in the Witch Alliance, she does not think that the two are the same thing. Without it, the latter is too refined. The pattern above is not only beautiful, but also very complicated, just like the lines drawn with hair. These lines are not only used to fill the paper, but also constitute a variety of patterns and text. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the front of the paper is the tower of the tower, and the back is a mountain under the sun. Below the pattern are the words "Graycast Royal Family Release" and "Witches Only", and the other four corners also contain three ten and one unidentified symbols. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most what Molly loves is that if you slowly rotate the paper, the two sides of the pattern will also reflect a little gold in the light, as if The grain is carved out in gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
