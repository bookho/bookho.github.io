What is going on?" he frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably think that it is more difficult to be alone, it is better to merge into another family," William seems to be a little surprised at why he cares so much about a small aristocrat "When you want to maintain a decent life, you need a lot of money. If you don't manage well, the territory is a drag."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it possible? Persecution? For example, to win something on the ground."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This...should be unlikely," said the count, sinking. "I was at some previous banquets." I have seen them a few times, but I didn’t talk about it. The Glan and the Somé family who changed their surnames are quite harmonious, and they don’t see what they are forced to do. If you want to know more, I am now It can be called Dortmund Sommers--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Roland interrupted the other person through the whisper of the nightingale. "I am just casual." Just asking is not a matter of much importance. However, this time, the Ge Lanjia The members seem to have not come over?" If her younger brother Hyde came, the nightingale should be recognized early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The banquet was invited according to the usual specifications, but this is my negligence," the old town owner apologized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of these words is already obvious. Even if you change your family name and become a branch of the Somé family, you are still not in his invitation - although silver Due to the developed mining industry driving the city, the style of this place is similar to that of Huiguang City. Compared with titles and titles, it is more worthy of wealth and strength... but it also shows from the side that the Gelan family is almost ready to be Forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that after the nightingale left, Hyde inherited the title of the father's Viscount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s sad enough to mix this step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the camp, Roland just pulled the tent curtain, and the nightingale took the initiative to explain, "Your Majesty, I am not concerned about Hyde, since leaving silver After Guangcheng, I have nothing to do with the Ge Lan family. Please believe me - I was just, just a little surprised."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See each other The face "is not what you think", Roland couldn't help but tease her, but when she thinks about the genius of the nightingale, if she is taken seriously and then insists on her mind, then it is his turn to have a headache. . So he coughed twice and nodded in an understatement. "I know, you never lie to me on this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't believe... wrong, I didn't fully believe it!" The nightingale immediately pointed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃, not good, or brought a little joke, the result was distinguished by her ability. Roland had to take a deep breath and remove the distracting thoughts from her mind. Then she looked at her eyes and said, "I believe in you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the turn of the night. Freedom, her cheeks are reddish and her eyes are unconsciously offset. "I am really just surprised. I have nothing to do with the person who betrayed me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Although Roland wants to say that even if it is a human nature, it is better to follow her at this time, "What are you surprised?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The Somi family once had a good relationship with their father..." The nightingale whispered. "After the death of my father, they also came to visit the old Gülen's house, but after I knew that I was a witch, Old Gülen would not. Allow me to meet them again. I didn’t expect the Viscounts of Somé to be in the family of Hyde, which really makes me feel a little surprised.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roland, who has been immersed in the world for many years, immediately understood what she meant. If the two relationships are so good, they should It is not uncommon to help her younger brother reinvigorate the family after the death of Lao Gelan. This is not uncommon in the aristocratic story. The descendants of the loft are reviving with the help of others, and they are rewarded with several times of wealth to even return the other. For the sake of consistency, it is something that everyone talks about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the case for the only heir to change his last name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the Graham family is completely cut off, and the Viscount title will not be passed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
