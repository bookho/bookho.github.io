			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the magnificent church hall, the priest is looking down at a farmer kneeling at his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person’s original burly figure has now become a group, his hands shivering slightly, and the skin is showing an abnormal blue-violet color. If it is not for a long time, these color blocks will It condenses into dark spots and eventually spreads to the whole body - it is only infected today, it is considered to be strong enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know you, living in the Stone Mountain in Dongcheng District, often brings some fresh wheat grains to the church." The priest said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...remember me! Great, priests," he said again and again. "My family is infected with evil, I, I need Holy Spirit Pharmacy, I beg you--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what did you bring to the church this time? The holy medicine is not something you can give at will," Not slow to say, "It requires you to exchange with a sincere heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I bought the medicine, the money was cheated by the mice." ", Shishan trembled and said, "Please forgive me for being dishonest. I shouldn’t seek a shortcut to the black market. I have only the last egg left, please accept it." He took out one from his arms. A rounded egg with both hands over the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Putting your hopes on a black market full of fraud and injustice will naturally be punished, but the gods will always lend a helping hand to the lost lambs, only consciousness Those who have made their mistakes will go further and further on the road of pilgrimage." Fei Li took the eggs and smiled. "Get up, God forgives you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Really, really?" Stone Mountain did not dare to set the channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The messenger of God never lie." Fei Liqi waved, and another believer immediately took a box of potions and came forward. He picked out four bottles and handed them to the other party. "If I remember correctly, how many people are there in your family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Adult," he swallowed, holding the Holy Spirit medicinal In my hand, lean down and kiss the priest's shoes. "Thank you, thank you! I will dedicate my life to the church and give it to the true God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The believers were also moved by this scene, cheering and cheering for the addition of a devout person to the church family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cheers are a little rested, Fei Li presses down and presses to indicate that everyone is quiet, then sings: "Next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of hair ritual continues until dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the bells of the whole city of Wangcheng, the priests of the priests announced the end of the ceremony today and continued tomorrow morning, leaving the hall in the retention and pleading of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the body is a little tired, but his spirit is still shaking, standing in the hall to listen to the pleadings and pledges of the people, watching them can’t wait to please their appearance, I can’t help It is the feeling of the gods to raise the stock itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, as the gods are the church itself, Fei Li thinks, after developing the evil epidemic and drugs, you can easily control the life and death of others, this power and What is the difference between true God? He couldn't help but feel that the most correct choice for his life was to abandon his inheritance and turn to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such power, no one can stop it. A wealthy businessman? A nobleman with a high weight? In the face of death, they are willing to abandon everything in exchange for the opportunity to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the back hall rest area, a priest hurriedly greeted him and whispered in his ear: "Adult, a mouse reported that the situation was discovered." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"East escaping, specific news he I will only say it after I see you." The official returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the church’s previous instructions, Fay should make full use of the plague and antidote, and convert as many believers as possible to Hermes, so it’s also a way to win the fugitives. Part of his plan, but compared to the city people of Wangdu, the importance is not so high. He had planned to go on for another two or three days, and then wait for the homeless wanderers to die halfway through the city for treatment, and let them fill the vacancy of Wang Du. In this way, a large Wangcheng city will have 90% of the population become a believer in the church. Such merits, plus the previous order of the king, may be enough to let him go further and set foot on the position of the bishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is wrong with the fugitives? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suppressed the doubts in his heart, and kept moving. "You take him to the secret room, I will arrive later."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ferry took off the priest's robe and took a soft armor from the closet. Then, he put on a loose coat and arranged it for the silver mirror. He walked to the secret room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the small room in the basement, the priest saw the "whistleblower" - the hair was messy, the face was browned, and the thin arms could see the shape of the bone at a glance. . But the strange thing is that he did not see the symptoms of dark spots on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, my name is the eye of the needle," the other priest immediately saw the priest. "I have important information to tell you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." He looked up and looked at the other room in the secret room. Two people, want to talk and stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is the Shattrath priest, my decent man," said Fei Li. "The other is a brown tooth mother, responsible for taking care of it." This secret room almost never leaves this place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I said, but you promised--"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The potion is here," he threw up the blue vial impatiently. "As long as your intelligence is valuable, I will naturally cure your evil."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, I guarantee that this information is absolutely amazing," said the needle. "Someone is constantly transporting the fugitives. There are vacant boats everywhere on the canal. This is me." I saw it with my own eyes. I was afraid that they would be able to take all the fugitives away in a few days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take away those patients with dark spots?" The brow wrinkled. "Are you not mistaken?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had received news of a fleet receiving refugees from the East, but this is normal. Happening- When the country nobility like to take advantage of a natural disaster or other home territory appear **, very cheaply and plunder away a group of labor. Anyway, waiting for the epidemic, those idiots will naturally be punished by the gods. But now... How can anyone know that the evil is rampant and go to shelter the refugees? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, they have a cure for evil! After the mercenaries gave the patient a bag of strange water, the dark spots quickly faded. Someone They also claimed that they came from the West, and as long as the fugitives followed the fleet, they would get food, shelter and remuneration.” The pinhole paused. “The most incredible thing is that there are witches in this group!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thousands of true, adults!" he muttered, "I am mixed with fugitives." The team got on the boat and didn't find it at first. Until someone jumped out of the boat, the mercenaries on the shore chased it up in a while. I noticed that the shadow of the sky was not a bird, but a flying witch. I was so scared that I couldn't move, until the sailboat drove out a few miles, and I couldn't see the witch anymore. I found the opportunity to escape and escape. It took almost a day to come back." The eye of the needle smashed the hand, "Adult, you Is it worthwhile to exchange a bottle of holy medicine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait, you say they have the means to treat illness evil, and you drink the potion, which means you are not sick? "He asked ceremony fee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...this is true, but you are not saying it, as long as you hear valuable news, you can" - squinting Laughter, revealing a jagged yellow tooth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that he wants to take the bottle of the Holy Spirit that has not been used, and take it to the black market for sale. The ritual for a moment, "How many people are there? You Make sure they are mercenaries of the caravans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's true, they don't have armor, no horses, weapons are wooden rifles, number..." The eye of the needle scratched his head. "The maximum number is no more than one hundred!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the ship? Which one is it?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...I don't know, most of the ships don't have flags, even if I hang it, I can't recognize it. Anyway, the mercenary said that the fleet will drive to the west. Ah... ... yes, he also mentioned that this is the recruitment of the lords of Bianyan Town." He retracted his brain and thought, "It seems to be to open up the land, the lord needs to accommodate a lot of manpower. I can remember so much." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
