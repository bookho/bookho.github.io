Cole’s hesitant color, "I will write to you tomorrow to write to my father, but I don’t think he will agree." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Itis can't be denied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that she did not deny that Cole’s courage was a little bigger, “I’ve also read the booklet that I gave you, let’s not talk about the above. It’s not true. The biggest aristocrat who used it as an example is only the son of the Earl. Now it’s the equivalent of the Duke without a land. Really, if I’m just a jazz, I’ll definitely make the same choice. But the father is The righteous Northland is in charge, the Duke of Yongyecheng, the status and power are far from the eldest son of the honeysuckle. Once you agree to kneel down, it means that the territory will be handed over. This is not an improvement, but a real decline. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaks well," Isis smiled and nodded, but before she got happy, she continued, "But you ignored a little." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, we can occupy these positions and powers." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col looks a stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You obviously put your attention on the stories behind the manual, but I care more about the opening of it." Itis picked up the bed. Brochure, open the cover, "If this is the idea of ​​your Majesty... you have to say it is very interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Feudal...general?" Cole probe Tao, "Do you understand what it means?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a birth word, you can understand it as our current system, or call it It’s OK to be a nobleman.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The younger brother showed a confused look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis shook his head in secret, these contents seem quite sloppy at first glance, and it seems inexplicable in the brochure, which is far less vivid than the later examples. However, if you can understand its true meaning, you will find that this is the basis for Roland Wimbledon's decision to implement the new law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was the first to see such a novel and thorough statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you ever thought about why we should divide the land to the knights and family members?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "They will be loyal to the Kant family," Cole muttered. "And it can attract more brave people to work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If the father took all of the Northland?" Itis then asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean that all belong to the family?" The younger brother thought about it and shook his head. "Of course not. If you occupy all the territories, the knights will leave the North." - They don't have an industry, they will definitely go to other places to look for opportunities, and so are small aristocrats. Doesn't that mean that there are only a few Kant aristocrats in several towns?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Is it not good?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!" Kerr blinked and seemed to be wondering why his sister would raise such a shallow question, "Northern So big, just rely on our family to manage it. If the cliff city is attacked, the guards will start from Yong Yee City. It will take about half a week to get there. This does not include the time of the news. And collecting food is also very troublesome. We can't expect those people to voluntarily pay these things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we continue to expand our genus in order to preserve our land. The vassal of the next, in the final analysis, is due to the needs of war and The limited ability of the abilities - this is also the main cause of the feudal system. "Itis caressed the pages of the book. "But now the situation has changed. No matter how we expand the team, we can't stop the thunder of the majesty. The army has no rivals in the entire kingdom. At the same time, His Majesty is also convinced that a strong city hall can manage the whole situation, and naturally there is no need to separate the land to the nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
