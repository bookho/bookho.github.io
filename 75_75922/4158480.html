			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the castle from the North Slope Mine, Roland recruited Barov and Construction Minister Carl into the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need the Executive Office to do a new metallurgical material supply plan as soon as possible, to spread the focus of supply from the North Hill to other places - whether it is a long song The fortress is still in Chishui City. The only thing to be guaranteed is that the quantity cannot be reduced. Beipo Mountain can no longer be mined again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two look suddenly After a big change, Karl looked down and Bark slowly bowed his head. Barov asked with difficulty. "Have you...has the situation in the north, is it so bad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Northside?" Roland responded with a slight glimpse. The other side thought that there was a new strong enemy on the fertile plains, and even the First Army could not compete. Therefore, in order to save the city, the North Slope Mine had to be abandoned. He shook his head in a good and funny way. "The army has not fallen to the point where it is necessary to lie by lie to maintain the hearts of the people. Not to mention the fact that you are in charge of logistics, and you can see the general situation from the consumption of medical materials. How can you ask such a question? "Brazov quickly wiped the sweat on his forehead. "Ah haha... I just pretended to be a rainy day. In fact, I was strange at the beginning, still I thought that the witch had discovered the new information in the Tianhai world, and it was too late to inform the Executive Office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that case, why are you giving up the North Slope? Mine?" Carl couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the mine is about to fly soon." Roland shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are silent again, but they look a bit strange this time. It is as if you are doubting your ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't get it wrong, it will fly and become a floating island." Roland looked at the two with interest, the ancient witch Eleanor I’ve said it roughly the same thing as the core of the magic. “Remember the iron box that was asked to be transported back by the Executive Office. It’s the center of God’s god. It’s just because the transplant is risky, not the last moment. No one can tell the result, so I have not told you the details. Now you can know that the plan is very successful, and there will be a territory floating in the air soon after the winter city."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baroph's eyes widened, and he couldn't pick up the words for a while, but Karl was already excited and shivering. He asked with a trembling vibrato. "Your Majesty, what you want is not just a huge stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't say it Wrong," Roland is no longer selling off. "It will be a floating warship, a fortress that does not fall. It has to meet the needs of a large number of soldiers for several months or even a whole year. It can actively attack the enemy and itself." Have a certain defense ability. How long does it take you to transform Beipo Mountain into this way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a person of science and engineering, he can fully understand Carl's excitement, any designer who pursues, wants to put his work in the most incredible place, can create a floating city by hand, this is definitely an opportunity that can be met and not available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It takes four to five years to plan according to the general project, but I don’t think it will take so long, and the floating city cannot be counted as general. The project." Carl almost immediately replied, "Considering its characteristics, the Ministry of Construction can completely station an engineering team and follow the mountain body. If I am not mistaken, my Majesty must be the resident of the empty knight. In addition, as long as there is a replenishment point, their attack and defense range will far exceed all artillery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that ten or so landings have been built. After the game, the construction minister's understanding of the Air Force became more and more profound. Roland smiled and nodded. "Go on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meet the Air Knight The landing and landing field is nothing more than a runway, warehouse and fuel, ammunition reserve room. These things have mature and feasible plans and drawings, which can be completed in one week. So kneel - "Karl breasts," the minimum is One week. After a week, it will satisfy your basics. Seeking, the rest of the project is nothing more than supplementing, perfecting, and expanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about building materials?" Barov asked, "once North It’s very difficult to fly up the hill and want to transport it again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
