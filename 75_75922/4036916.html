			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Isabella’s description of the soul battlefield, the heart of the nightingale gradually sank to the bottom. “You mean, you don’t know how to let your majesty Woke up in a slumber?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head. "There is no precedent for this result. I really can't solve it...but, when the radish was swallowing Garcia, After a while, she explained that she found some interesting things in her memory, so she spent a lot of time. The life of Jieluo is more complicated than anyone, I guess Roland wants to accept this part. Memory, the time it takes is probably longer. But as long as he is alive, he should naturally wake up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night can’t judge whether this content is authentic or not, she Can only judge that the other party is not lying - at least these guesses, for the pure person is the idea from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she also knows that the situation is not optimistic at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two hundred years of memory for the church, and the prince’s career for the next twenty years, which one will become dominant? Will Roland be lost in the complicated memory and never wake up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reversely say that if he really accepts all the memories of Jieluo and then wakes up, then he is still the fourth of Roland Wimbledon and Gray Fort. Prince...and her jealous people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rush of thoughts made it impossible for the nightingale to control its own state of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also understands why Wendy wants Aegis to come with her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk to the church," Aegusa said after a moment of indulgence, "How much do you know about the predecessor of the church, the federation?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jie Luo knows, I basically know," Isabella replied very cooperatively. "Are you still skeptical about the contents of the letter? Since Jie Luo took over as the pope After the position, the purers who have been approved by the sect of the sect can enter the library and read the covert history of 400 years ago, and the records of the witch empire and the devil are true."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it’s just the news on the letter, it’s not of much value to us,” Aegusa smiled slightly. “The witch empire is history for you. In my eyes, it is part of life. I am the witch of the federation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it was Isabella’s surprise, "You ......What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I came from the holy city of Tacchi, more than 400 years ago, and witnessed the Holy The devil is not a rare thing. They still occupy most of the land of the Twilight. There is a devil's camp at the end of the hidden forest west of the Grey Fort and the Red River. Roland has already handed over them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure man is in the same place, and he can’t speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a matter of time before the war with the devil. We all know that the battle of divine war is coming. If it is not for the church to step by step, Roland will not choose to be here. It’s time to fight the aftermath with a decisive battle.” Ai Ge Sha has paused. “What I want to know is how the Federation turned into a church?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This..." After a while, Isabella returned to God. "The history book mentioned that during the escape, the Federation broke out a civil war, located on the northwest side of the desolate mountains. The cause was not elaborated. I only knew that the federation split into two factions. The one was mainly based on the Takira witch, and entered the maze of the mountains. One group was the witch of the Star City. They inherited the will of the Akaris. Continue north, settle down under the Hermes Plateau and become the current church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The civil war on the road to escape?" Ai Gesha frowned. This is simply a suicide."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The writer of the history book It is so thought that the Federation suffered heavy losses in the civil war. Not only did it lose the two extraordinary, but it was completely out of touch with the mortal team. When the North Party arrived at the destination, those people had already escaped. Eight." Isabella sighed. "As for the subsequent battle of faith, it is only to kill non-combat witches who are not in the Star City. Only then can the church completely bury the past history." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it the burial of the past to facilitate the hunting of witches to create a godless penalty army?" The night sighs, "You are all crazy."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
