			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Hill Fox walks into the basement of the palace, he feels his heart Shaking - not fear, but excitement. Excited tough to suppress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of the torch is dancing for him, and the resounding stepping on the slate is praising him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never felt that the dark and quiet basement was so wonderful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reaching the bottom, Tassa searched him again and again, then patted him on the shoulder, whispered, "Go, don't wait too. Long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill nodded and couldn’t wait to go dark... Through a dark walkway, he was slowing down when he was near the cage. This is a memorable moment, he wants to taste the taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he saw the murderer who killed his wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pseudo-Willifoke. Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, Hill licked his mouth, his eyes filled with tears... everything he did was not in vain, and the results came earlier than he thought. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the wife can see this scene, it should also bloom smile? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What...people?" The other turned and eagerly slammed to the railing. "Is it, devil... Have you changed your mind?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill stepped out of the shadows and stepped to the cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco gave a slight glimpse, then showed a vigilant look, and moved backwards two steps. "Who are you? Who put you in! Roland. Wen What about Bouton? I want to see him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the king who is high on weekdays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill only saw the appearance of Tefko in the throne ceremony, when he wore a crimson robes, holding a golden scepter, wearing The crown of Hua Huagui, under the embrace of the Knights of the Kings, stepped onto the platform and accepted the coronation. Hill also had expectations. He hoped that he would be a good king and let everyone live a stable life. However, the subsequent search and arrest made the Acrobatic Troupe and the family torn apart, and all the shackles of the future were turned into bubbles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, he finally realizes the feeling of revenge - unlike the bitterness described in the story, neither has compassion for the enemy, nor The emptiness after success. He only felt sweet and happy, and his long-lost heart was once again moisturized... unexpectedly, he found himself quite like this feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Hill. Fox, Your Majesty," Hill snorted. "You can't know me, members of the "Dove and Hat" Acrobatic Troupe. But I know you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Tefco was cold-faced and did not speak.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He did not care at all, and then said: "The Acrobatic Troupe originally had seven members, but for your sake, we lost a partner. The remaining six people are no longer focused on performances, but in the mix with mice and pubs, inquire about any movements about you, then organize the messages, analyze them and send them to Roland. He paused. "By the way, your plan to develop snow powder, and the forced recruitment of militia into the West, are the information we send." In addition, the sudden closure of the two saltpeter fields in the suburbs was also done by me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to say? "Tefico blinked. "A thief who is complacent about what he is doing?" A traitor who betrayed his king and sold his glory for profit? I don't know what kind of pigeon hat Acrobatic Troupe, put away your tricks, people! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right? traitor? No... Your Majesty, I just followed my heart,” Hill said quietly. “The partner is my wife. She is desperately in the search for your witch, in prison, she is tortured and insulted, and the murderer's final punishment is only twenty-six silver wolves. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faceco's eyes flashed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
