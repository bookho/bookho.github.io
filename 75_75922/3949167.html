			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week the weather has not been good, the top of the head is always gray, Carl. Vabert's mood is the same as the weather, down to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking on the wet stone street, someone greets him from time to time - in this small town, Karl runs a college. Unlike the colleges where the nobles of the Grey Fort can attend, he also teaches the children of ordinary people. Therefore, in Bianbu Town, he has a very high reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Mr. Vabert, good morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr., my son Is it okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When is it free, Carl, go fishing together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Karl always responds to them with a smile, but today he just nodded and said nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Anna’s hangman was seen, there was a crack in the world in his eyes—or the crack had been there since leaving the Grey Fort, but he deliberately Turn a blind eye. He used his busy work to paralyze himself, and the innocent smile of the students also masked the crack to some extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Anna died, he discovered that there was no change in the world. The rift not only did not disappear, but expanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Anna, his memory stayed half a year ago. She is not conspicuous among the 30 children in the college. She has a normal appearance and few words, but one thing makes Karl impressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is her passion for knowledge. No matter what she teaches, her words, or history, she can always remember the first one. Even he himself feels the history of boring religious evolution, and the other party can hold the book for a whole day. He has also seen a little girl helping to care for the neighbor's sheep. In the sun, Anna carefully brushed the lamb with hair and acted softly to take care of the baby. The picture he still remembers very clearly, the girl's smile is sweet and beautiful, and it is impossible to hook up with evil anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a fire broke out in the neighborhood, Anna’s mother died unfortunately, and Anna did not come to the college again. Until a week ago, she was proved to be a witch, hanged in the square in the town center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treed by the devil? Unclean people? Evil? It’s all fart! For the first time in his mind, he had doubts about the Holy See, and for the first time he had doubts about the knowledge he had taught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna is not a witch, he does not know, but the word evil does not turn her! If a girl who is not yet mature and curious about the world can be called evil, then the administrative officials in the Grey Fort are all devils from hell! For hundreds of Golden Dragons, the stone was deliberately stolen, causing the collapse of the theater in the new district, and more than 30 stonemason members died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but are they on the gallows? not a single one! The judge finally ruled that the stonemason's leader was improperly built and exiled, and the stonemason would order the dissolution. In order to avoid the limelight, Carl, who knows the inside story, had to drag the house to escape from the gray fort, all the way to the west, and finally to the border town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started the college, has many students, met new neighbors, new friends, but the crimes played by the Grey Fort is always engraved in his mind. Now, once again, he feels the ridicule of the world - what is evil, can the gods in heaven really see it clearly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last straw that overwhelmed Karl was Nana Va. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa is different from Anna, and can even say the opposite. She is a very lively girl and she is also very famous in the college. As long as she doesn't attend class, she rarely sees that she has a stop, not riding a tree to make a bird, or squatting in the grass. Asked what she did, she giggled for a while before answering that she was quarreling with the ants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa’s face is always full of smiles, which seems to be her nature. This tragic and difficult world has nothing to do with her, at least in the college, she can always laugh without any worries. Carl even had a hint of curiosity - did she cry from birth to now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until two days ago, Nana Wa found him with a blank face. "Teacher, will I be hanged like Anna?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, isn't that Mr. Vabert? Please come here and help us to see what is written on it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karl feels someone is pulling him On the sleeves, he looked up and found that he did not know when he had arrived at the town square. Many years of people squatting around the bulletin board, and hearing the name of Van Burt, everyone consciously let a road open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You come too sir, let us have a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes It was always read by Meg, and the result was that the stomach hurts to go to the bathroom and has not come back until now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is normal, he will definitely laugh Nod and then explain the contents of the bulletin board to everyone in detail. But now Carl finds that he can't do it—the smiles and enthusiasm of these people are not like fakes, but for him, it's harder to bear than the masks of smirk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hanged Anna’s notice is also posted on it, and everyone is so excited to discuss. In a sense, you are all murderers. He said in his heart that your ignorance and ignorance killed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl pressed his emotions and took a breath and went to the announcement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The prince recruited people to build Bianbu Town, and there are many grades to choose from," he said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am also one of the murderers, and what qualifications are there to blame them? Isn't it true that the person who tells them that the witch is an evil person? Carl only felt that the corners of his mouth were bitter, and I said something to the children. I told the church about the teachings of the church. I thought I was doing a good job, hell! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gravel, requires men, 20 to 40 years old, strong and strong. Reward 25 copper eagle every day."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mason craftsmen, gender-free, 18 years of age or older, with masonry experience, 45 bronze hawks per day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Handyman, male, 18 years old or older, pays 12 copper hawks per day.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;No, he has to do something. If Anna’s death is irreparable, then at least Nanawa can’t be repeated. There was a voice in Karl's heart, and he didn't stand up when the stonemason would be destroyed. When Anna was hanged, he didn't stand up. Should he keep silent like this, watching the lovely children being sent to the gallows? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what can he do? With Nana Wawa fleeing from Bianbu Town - he has his own family, the family has flown from the gray fortune, and the situation has just improved and left? Not to mention that Nanawa himself was born into a rich family. Can she live without a fixed life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stone craftsman, gender is not limited, age is not limited, anyone who has participated in municipal construction, fortress, fortifications, long-term recruitment of the city hall, monthly remuneration 1 Golden Dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Supplemental Terms: Experienced and outstanding, can be awarded to the official position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; After reading the notice, everyone has become noisy. "The monthly salary of Jinlong is comparable to the cavalry of the Long Song Fortress!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you? Is it possible to base a dung pit, but also build a fortress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't stare at this, the first few items are also very good. If you pay for it every day, it’s not much less than hunting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Really, hunting may also lose your life, and hiding the forest is not casual. The place where you can go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl. Vabert did not pay attention to this, and his full attention was focused on the final seal and signature of the notice. That was the autograph of the four princes Roland Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the prince not know how long it is the month of the demon? No matter what he wants to build, it is not a good time to start work at this moment. It seems that His Highness Wimbledon knows nothing about the construction. If he can draw his attention with the name of the stonemason's club... Karr suddenly has an idea. Perhaps through this recruitment, he can see the prince himself - the town of Bentham. The highest governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
