			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the train stopped in front of everyone, the Iron Axe finally got a glimpse of its full picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has only five knots, which is much shorter than the public display, but it seems to be much thicker and bigger because of the steel plate. Together with the non-reflective black appearance, it is like a wild beast lying prone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front and rear sections are exactly the same shape, just in a symmetrical arrangement - except for two rotatable machine gun towers, the lower armor belt There are also many small holes, and there is no doubt that those holes are used to observe and shoot the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Axe has been able to imagine the situation when the enemy rushed to a new weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain-dropping spear hits the steel plate and makes a jingling sound, but the train does not move and still maintains a steady speed. At the same time, one side of its body squirts more than a dozen fires toward the enemy, and the target that enters the range is made into a honeycomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the devil or the evil beast can only be beaten passively, and it is not enough. It is like a moving wall that provides the most reliable protection for the First Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s exciting to think about it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a vague discussion among the soldiers in charge of the alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the place where the train is the most eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to securing the front line for the First Army, its ultimate goal is to destroy the ruins of Takira, as well as the skeleton monsters of the towers, so large-caliber artillery It is a must. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, these two deadly weapons are placed in the second and fourth compartments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it still carries 152mm cannons, according to His Majesty, these guns have longer barrels and more charge. This point can be seen with the eyes alone - a cannon almost takes up the entire space of the entire car, and even a machine gun can not be plugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tail of the barrel is also surrounded by a huge iron shell, which is even wider than the body, so even if the devil attacks from the air, Interrupt the shooting of the artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that worries the Iron Axe is that this new surround design is safe, but it also adds a lot of weight and size, and is quite top-heavy. In particular, the gun needs to be adjusted when shooting. If the whole rotation is over, can the train withstand the violent impact of the fire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reporting," a soldier ran to the front of the king and saluted. "All personnel are ready, please order!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a weapon that has not yet been officially installed. Whether it is repair or improvement, it is the responsibility of the engineering department." Roland smiled and shook his head. "So today is not responsible for the test work. Me, but the Minister of Engineering - you should report to her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Axe noticed that the Queen also attended the test. It was nothing more than a witch, her dress was exactly the appearance of a work uniform, so that he did not recognize it in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wang, Queen's Your Majesty..." The soldiers suddenly stuttered and he re-presented Anna. "All personnel are ready, ready..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Anna replied calmly. "Let them start testing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Yes!” The reporter hurriedly yelled at the train, “Starting the artillery!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This episode made everyone smile at the same time, but There was no impact on the test, and as the password was issued, the alarm sounded over the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“呜——————呜——————”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axe Immediately, he turned his gaze back to the train. When a squeak of a winch came, he was surprised to find that the car body had changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
