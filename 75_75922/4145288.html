			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is also the power of...the magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the magic alone In terms of expression, even if you have exhausted your life, you can't finish it. In what you can understand, it is above the four strengths, and it is also the ultimate solution of the unification." In a calm tone, it sounds incredible. Explain, "But even this does not mean that you can enter the field of the gods at will and interfere with the operation of the battle of God. After all, the world is relatively independent, like a thick film, it is this feature that I Have the opportunity to meet you here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s mind is a picture of blowing bubbles, in the slowly rising bubbles, as if One is the world of dreams, "How can we get through the barriers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same way as magic enters our world," he paused. Erosion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... can you speak more in detail?"<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should have noticed that the world was very different from the time it was first born." The other side said that Roland’s heart beats two more times. "It was really just a reflection of your consciousness, but now it’s There are a lot more things that you haven't seen before, and all these changes start with your ability to recycle nature."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know this? Roland was a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I have been in the conscious world since the moment I started my self, I am very sensitive to such changes." I don't shy away from it." Listening to the children, whether in the dream world or in the realm of the gods, they use magic to maintain their existence. In reality, they are the forces of nature. By constantly recycling them, the world will continue to expand until the gods The areas in which they overlap overlap and there are erosion cracks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This theory is almost the same as the explanation at the welcome meeting of newcomers. "As far as I know, the martial arts association It collects a lot of fallen cores of nature. If you want to recycle them as soon as possible, isn't it the most advantageous option to stand on the side of the fallen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp I accidentally did not express my opposition, but smiled bitterly. "Unfortunately, I am only a disciple of the guards. I can't bring you into the central shelter of Prism City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Even if it has nothing to do with the association's revenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can stop the battle of God's will, the dream world will naturally not be threatened by erosion. In a sense, this is consistent with the purpose of the association. Only... ...the child may feel sad. After all, she is full of expectations for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking here, there is a rare look on his face, like There is a little bit of silence in the helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does she mean... Jiaxia? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but feel a little unexpected. Since the other person is a person who serves the gods, there is a time to live in millions of years. Such a person should have been obsessed with everything. Why did he have such a strong feeling for an ordinary disciple? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, is the other party accustomed to playing, or is it unconsciously affected by this identity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't say that I have to do that." Roland intended to use coffee to ease some of the stiff atmosphere, only to think of the cup had been smashed and had to stretch out. The hand was collected again. "And you said that you must be able to enter the conscious world at the same time in both worlds? Maybe the core of recycling will be enough. The only question is how do I judge the world of dreams? Has it overlapped with the realm of the gods? Can the erosion in the prism city always be the entrance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, the void caused by erosion is the emptiness of the ideology The zone, and here have very different rules, can not be used as a channel." Nod and said, "As for the extent to which the world of the gods can be eroded, you will naturally feel it at that moment. But this It will also open the countdown to destroying all things at the same time. You must open the bottomless path before that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;岚摇摇摇. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
