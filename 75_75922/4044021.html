			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the rush of molten iron, silicon and manganese are first oxidized, and then the carbon in the pig iron is turned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high temperature of nearly 1,500 degrees, carbon combines with oxygen in the air to form carbon monoxide, and the heat released causes the furnace to "boiling". The flame from the mouth of the furnace almost engulfs the blowpipe and the hob – this is why the bracket also covers the heat-resistant coating. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large amount of carbon monoxide escapes outwards, and is in contact with the outside air at the mouth of the furnace, followed by intense combustion, which is like a furnace. The violent sound of the gas expansion overshadowed the sound of the steam engine for a time. Everyone could not help but retire before the scene like a volcanic squirt. Only Roland stood with his hands and stood up against the hot wind, completely immersed in the roar of the steel flame. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the current technology can only be filled with air to make steel, and if it can be replaced with pure oxygen in the future, the fireworks will be even brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last reaction is phosphorus and sulfur. When the oxides of the two and the limestone form slag, the flame begins to retreat. At this time, the molten iron is basically steel. . The lighter slag floats on the molten steel. As long as the converter is tilted, the molten steel can be poured out of the tapping port like pouring tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in accordance with the rules of modern steel mills, it is necessary to use the slag ball, the slag dart, and the infrared detection method to avoid the upper scum flowing into the steel ladle. in. No winter city's current technology can't do this, so Roland's solution is also very simple, that is, don't fall too clean. When there is still a small amount of molten steel left in the furnace, the furnace is directly lifted, and then they are poured together with the slag. If you waste a little, you will waste a little. If you collect more, you can return to the furnace to refine it. Anyway, he does not have to pursue any production benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure the quality of steel, the finishing work is to remove excess oxygen from the molten steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bauxite that is continuously transported from the long song fortress can act as a deoxidizer - a bucket of pure aluminum separated from Lucia is poured In the molten steel, the generated alumina slag is floated together with the unreacted aluminum to the surface layer, and the entire steelmaking process is completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the bright molten steel flowed into the mold and turned into a piece of dark red steel ingot, the officials of the City Hall had been shocked to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main means of steelmaking in this era is still at the level of 100-forged steel, a steel body can be passed down from generation to generation, who is also I have never seen steel produced like flowing water - even if the "Steel Star" has been able to produce steel in large quantities, most people regard it as an accessory to the witch's ability. Without Anna and Lucia, it is not a production. Come out of this steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time it is different, seeing that converter steelmaking does not need to rely on the power of witches, only by the hands of ordinary people can do it, they are faintly aware What does this mean?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one "Steel Star", but there are countless converters and workers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steel is no longer a rare material, and in the future this sturdy metal will be produced from the foot of the North Slope, replacing those soft and fragile wooden and bronze With. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is very pleased with the fear of the city hall officials - if it can’t be shaken by the majestic beauty of the steelmaking process, it is estimated Will not be a qualified leader. Workers may only see the ingots in front of them, and they should be able to see the future represented by the ingots. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the coal-iron complexing industry without winter city has begun to take shape – from mining to smelting iron, then from smelting iron to steelmaking, and finally casting steel. In a variety of objects, this process can be achieved by ordinary people. Coupled with the fast-growing population and the popularization of education, Roland has been able to hear the sound of the steel wheel running over the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that the quality of the newly baked steel is still in need of further testing by Lucia, and the blowing time and the slag formulation are slowly adjusted according to the test results, but Everything is finally starting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland, who has completed a great cause, has not stopped, relying on the memory of the dream world Put, he still has a lot of work to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The junior textbook has now been completed and rewritten, and he has turned his attention to a higher level of mechanical professional textbooks - no winter city now has The basis of steel production, then high-performance processing equipment is undoubtedly what he needs urgently. The batches of simple machine tools that were originally manufactured have become less and less suitable for processing high-end products, and they are incapable of facing parts such as fortress guns, heavy machine guns, and grenade fuzes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
