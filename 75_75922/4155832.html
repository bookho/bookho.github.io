			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beware, the next step will fall faster, if you are afraid, you can close your eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the lightning bolt, a gray castle soldier flew out the edge of the hill. At the moment when the feet were suspended, the two men fell suddenly and fell down. After falling for a few tens of meters, they slowly stabilized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When stepping on the ground again, the soldier’s face was pale. “Thank you... thank you, Miss Lightning, I... vomit—”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through a few breaths, you can recover after a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she flew to the top of the mountain again , continue to find new ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the cat's claws expected, after the stone pillars were inserted into the position, some soldiers were split in the other half, and then were broken by the spider's attack. Although some people succeeded in crossing the blockade and merging with the guards of the assembly point, there were still some people trapped in the same place who could not move. They either refused to abandon their injured teammates or were struck by several spiders. After hearing the horn, I was unable to withdraw from the position for the first time. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the large forces have begun to withdraw in batches, the emergence of lightning has undoubtedly given them a chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the adult promotion does not bring much improvement to her weight-bearing ability, the height of 10 meters from the ground is enough to bring people out of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fly in the ointment is that she can only transfer one person at a time, and there will be a large drop when flying over the cliff, for the lightning that is used to high-speed dive Nothing, but for the soldier she was carrying, it was a real fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunshots on the ground gradually subsided. Obviously, no matter whether it is the devil or the blocking force, the lightning has also found ten people and they Uniformly placed on the trails on the back slope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, this is the last one." She took a new drop of the drop-off and put a sigh of relief. "You should be able to find the way down the mountain." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your help!" everyone shouted, "I don't know where the big forces are now?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are blocking the spiders coming from the north side on the other side of the mountain." Lightning explained the situation roughly. "This is no way to go around. You just go down the mountain and try to catch up." Arrive at Jinshiling before the floating land crosses the desolate mountains."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be...we understand." Everyone's look is a bit heavy, they are so Being able to support the rescue is based on the heroic sacrifice of the companions. Nowadays, the big forces are still fighting the enemy, but they are unable to contribute their own strength. This sentiment and unwilling emotions are on the surface of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a matter of regret, they all understand that it’s the only thing you can do without dragging your back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Miss Lightning." On the occasion of the separation, the spit-sold soldier began to hesitately, "When the stone pillar fell, The concealed fortification of the No. 3 gun was collapsed. I saw several soldiers hiding in the area before, and I don’t know if there are still survivors..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No.3 work," Lightning nodded. "I will go and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the crowd and turning away from the mountain, she vacated In the blink of an eye, he flew over the position. At the same time, McMug also issued a new warning to her by listening to the seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be careful, the devil will launch the third stone column!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Is the exit point?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, but it shouldn't be the top of the mountain!" The voice of Mai Hao suddenly trembled. "The stone pillar is coming!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning climbed to the air, and the black pillars crossed a high arc and flew straight toward the desolate mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She immediately made a judgment and decided to go first to support the blocking forces on the mountainside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Hilli on the Seagull slammed openly, "God..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" Andrea asked in amazement. In order to avoid being discovered by the devil, Sylvie had always closed his eyes before, and theoretically could not see the changes that occurred under the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a strong magical reaction!" she muttered incredulously. "It's fast moving closer to the desolate mountains!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic reaction? Andrea is a little glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds her of the cursed magic of Erskuk - in the final battle of Tacula, the other party used the avatar to release the magic to deliberately seduce The ambush squad was deserved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the source of the magic is not exactly the same as the body. Sylvie may not be able to discern the details for more than ten kilometers, but within this distance, she should be able to It is necessary to distinguish the authenticity of the source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the eye of the magic captured, in all likelihood, is a genuine high-order devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not clear why the enemy chose to expose his identity at this time, but since it has already been dispatched, the Seagull will not stay in the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning, their goal was to be the hardest guy on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia has been waiting for this moment for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next, it’s our turn to show!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xilvi stares at the cabin Below, there is a sweat on the forehead. "Is this really a devil? How can its magic be so large?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...have How strong?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Greater than Erskuk—” Hillvi bit his lip, “I’m afraid only when the leaves are in the heart of the forest. In order to compare with it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" Andrea stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has seen how rich the magic of the leaves that occupy the corner of the fascinating forest. It’s too much to say that it’s too vast, but it’s all by means of assimilation. The effect achieved. How can it be achieved by one person alone? "Hey... can you exaggerate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty directly activated all the listening notes, "His Royal Highness, Lightning, McMug, Here is the Seagull! Sylvie has detected that new enemies are approaching the mountains. From the magical reaction, the other party is likely to be a high-ranking promoter of the Maharajah level! Don't confront it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do we do?" asked the vagina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that still used?" Andrea clenched his fist. "Only such a guy is worthy of the bullet that blends the blood of my sister." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boom————————!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third stone pillar passes through the gap between the two peaks, sweeping through the large forests and slid down to the bottom of the valley. Behind it, the soil that was picked up and the roots of the trees mixed into a dark brown "wide road", in stark contrast to the surrounding snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat's claws are also slightly relieved at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordering a quick evacuation is obviously the right decision - the interval between shots of this round of stone pillars is significantly longer, and the enemies from halfway up the mountain are also eliminated. There are very few left, and the time difference they have seized at this moment is enough to deal with the new enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, the position of the pillars is just between them and the reserve team. The difference between the two can not only provide a good shooting for the shooters, more than a thousand meters. The distance can also arrange the firepower more calmly, and finally do not have to rush to meet the enemy as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
