			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning flies over the lost forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her eyes, the world seems to be getting smaller. Wherever the eyesight is, the details are hidden, leaving only one piece of color. The brown is the earth, the gray is the mountain, the green is the forest, and the blue is the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And green occupies the vast majority of the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different from the bright and bright grass green in the field of Bianbu Town. The green is mixed with gray and black, deep and thick. No matter whether it is going west or north, you can't see the end of this dark green. If you look at it for a long time, there will be a feeling that it is falling. Lightning has to look up at the sky after a while to dispel the growing sense of restraint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them, the gray clouds were so low that they covered the mountains of the desperate mountains and shrouded the town of Bianque under the rain and fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is now looking for the remains of the 450 years ago in the forest, which is undoubtedly a great adventure. Half a month ago, when I heard Roland’s task assigned to her, Lightning immediately patted her chest and promised. Unlike the snake magician Hakala, who holds the ancient books, His Royal Highness Roland has repeatedly explained that this drawing can only be used for reference, and he must pay attention to safety, and it does not matter if he can't find it. This makes the little girl feel very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows that her Highness is right. Even a castle, after more than four hundred years, will be swallowed by plants growing everywhere, gradually becoming one. Pile of dust. But she still wants to find this place - the location of the six-pointed star is determined, which is equivalent to determining the orientation of the holy city of Taqila. The lightning that has heard the ins and outs of nature naturally understands what Tachela means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where, she is likely to help His Royal Highness Prince to discover the true cause of the church’s concealment of the war with the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is much more exciting than the father’s own exploration of the route! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning According to the method of making a chart, draw a square of parchment on an equidistant grid, and then according to the distance you fly over a period of time, Simply calculate the content filled in the grid. When the grid is filled, almost the area is searched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is now halfway through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the approaching rain cloud is faster than the lightning imagination, the little girl can even faintly hear the thunder in the clouds, she lowers the height, the forest below Grab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a grayish shadow at the corner of the eye flashed past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She snorted, pulled her body, suspended in the air, and looked back at the range she had just passed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it an illusion? Lightning thought about it and decided to fly again in this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, she pressed the height lower, the forest is no longer a whole piece of green, mottled trunks, forked branches, differently shaped leaves ...the details have come out of the color block and returned to the lightning eye again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few dozens of interest, she suddenly saw a small white stone tower under the layers of branches. The top of the stone tower was cut off entirely, causing the tower to be covered by the trees and difficult to find in the sky. If it is not to avoid the rain, she is likely to miss it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of lightning is striking, is this the location of the ruins represented on the map? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She surrounded the stone tower for a week, did not find any abnormal situation, decided to look at it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After landing, the little girl discovered that it was not appropriate to say that it was a white stone tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's surface is covered with vines and moss, which has turned grayish green when viewed at close range. The tower is slightly tilted, and it is hit by a huge force. There are scattered stones around it. The material and color are similar to those of the stone tower. It should come from the top of the broken tower. The larger one can also see the trail. Small estimates have been buried in weeds and soil. The entire stone tower is quite large, and the bottom of the tower is equal to the castle under the seat of Roland. Artificial objects like this usually have a basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
