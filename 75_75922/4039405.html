			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he is responsible for raising this newborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland yawned as he climbed up from the bed, the ladder for the fall was still on one side, and the blinds were already bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you fall in the clothes, you only have one square trousers left. Is this the inertia of the subconscious? It seems that after I leave, my dreams will continue for a while, until I fall asleep, ensuring that every time I enter a dream, it is just when I wake up... This is too formalized! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to leave the election at midnight and try to see if he could eliminate this unconscious act of sleepwalking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there is no sequelae of adequate sleep. Roland feels that he is not like a person who just woke up from his sleep, his eyes are bun and his forehead is swollen. Feeling, I can't help but yawn - counting the time there, he hasn't closed his eyes for more than 20 hours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe wait for a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the short sleeve into the living room, he saw the small figure again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you get up so early today?" Jielu looked a little surprised. "I haven't started making breakfast yet...you are waiting for me in the living room, I This is going to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that she has just got up, and the long white hair that has not been taken care of is scattered on the shoulders, and there are several hairs. Lifting up, the appearance of peacetime is like two people. She is still wearing the light cyan dress and white stockings. If I remember correctly, the little girl has not changed her clothes for three days - according to her clean and tidy bedroom, it is definitely not because she is lazy or not dirty. It is only possible that there is not much clothes to change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown, Roland’s heart suddenly felt a sense of sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only for her, but also for herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reminiscent of the three hundred in his purse... No, two hundred and fifty dollars, he felt incredible. One is the main cause of the emergence of dreams, and the other is the creator of the dream world. The two people who created the world have fallen to such a point. It is not a tragic word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a way to go, whether it is buying books or exploring the world, money is essential. He has to find a way to get a steady income, or more than two hundred dollars, throwing away food and utilities, and not even going out to take a taxi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Roland thought about how to make money, Jie Luo was already busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lit the stove with her hands and feet, oiled the pan, broke the eggs with one hand, and sprinkled the flowing egg into the pot. Although the strength is not enough, but a small shovel in the hand to move up and down, the effect is no worse than shaking the iron pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sizzling of hot oil, the tempting scent of the omelet quickly fills the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the cost of living, the breakfast has not changed much. This time, there are still two fritters and a fried egg. One less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the fritters bought yesterday?" Roland took a bite and found that it was not so crisp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," Jielu muttered. "The last batch at the time of buying and collecting the stalls was especially cheap. Sometimes the boss would still use the unused flour dumplings. Give it to me, I can make a few fritters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is awkward, "When you are at home?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Almost," Xiaotou shook his head, not saying much, and didn't seem to want to mention his family. After eating breakfast, she simply put on her makeup and took her bag and went to the door. "Old rules, uncle, I will not come back at noon, the bowl will be washed by you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, go, be careful on the road." Roland nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo couldn’t help but smashed it. After a while, he slammed and closed the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland returned to the bedroom, flipping the bedside table and wardrobe from head to toe and sorting out all the belongings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the wallet, in addition to two hundred dollars, there is an ID card and a bank card, how shabby it is. Of course, the few expired lottery tickets were thrown directly into the trash can - even if it was, it had already exceeded the exchange time, not to mention that he did not believe that this small probability event would fall on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second is a mobile phone, the contact list is empty, the only valuable information is the bank card's income and expenditure reminder. It can be seen that at the end of each month, Jie Luo’s family will pay a living fee of 1,500 yuan. There are only 12 left in Cary, and there are still four days from the date of the next remittance. It’s not enough to starve, but there is no balance to do other things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few pieces of jewelry. The material looks like gold. I don’t know if it’s true or not. Is it probably for marriage? If you sell these to the gold store, you can probably recover about a thousand yuan, which is a contingency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are all the wealth that he is free to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not helpful to the current situation. Roland sighed and pointed his attention to the furnishings of the utility room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door at the very end of the residence and looked at a few old items placed inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust and spider webs combined with the sewing machine are estimated to sell for thirty or forty yuan, after all, iron casting, especially the latter, one It takes a lot of effort to move people. And the big iron gate, counted as scrap iron, can probably buy more than one hundred yuan? Maybe he usually doesn't put this money in his eyes, but now it is precious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you go to the old bookstore to buy out the textbooks, more than one hundred yuan is enough to buy a set of old books in all disciplines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it, he decided to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the small advertisement posted in the stairwell, Roland remembers to have a call for recycling, but before that, he had to wipe it out first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it looks clean, maybe you can sell more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After panting the bicycle and sewing machine to the living room, he found something wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick iron door does not seem to be leaning against the wall of the utility room, but is being built into the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hell, which bastard is this? To know that this wall is the outer wall of the package, is the door here, is it convenient for suicide? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is still a lock on the door! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait... He remembers that there are indeed two keys on the keychain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland immediately took the key and inserted the other piece into the keyhole, which fits perfectly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bang, the rusted lock should pop up and fall off the bolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is too lazy to smash this lock, pull the overhead, and forcefully open the iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cold wind mixed with snowflakes poured into the room, so that he couldn’t help but hit a few squats in short-sleeved pants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the iron gate turned out to be a snow scene! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the distant rolling snow-capped mountains, a gray-brown city is faintly visible. It is built along the mountain walls on both sides, enveloping itself in one In the big gap. In the center of the city stands a shackled building, like a pillar of the sky, standing in the whistling wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though Roland was the first to witness, he immediately realized where it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hermes New Holy City". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fortress city built with the help of a breakout mountain range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
