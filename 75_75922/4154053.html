			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world without magic?" The nightingale wondered, "Will the world be like this now? I think you both think too much?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It’s true." Anna returned, "The influence of power is mutual, introducing an inconspicuous part of a balanced system." Force can bring new changes to the whole system, let alone the magic of ubiquity. If it really appears halfway, then the world before should be unrecognizable. From your description, here and where you used to be The world is so close, the water will boil, the snow will melt, the sun will give warmth, and the earth will give birth to life, except that there is no magic, it is almost exactly the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is worthy of admiration - I think that line of words may be expressing this meaning." Roland resisted the coolness behind the scenes, "not within the framework of the four strong, but can seamlessly access it, and The world has a full-fledged impact, as if it is over 10,000 . On "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" What it really possible, "Anna frowned?. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can only be guessed like this." Roland held his palm in his hand. "And the emergence of magic must bring about change, but that change may not be What the other party expected," he paused, "--so it called the "cost." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds a bit...horrible. "The nightingale couldn't help but smack the mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is a good thing." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha? why? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world today is still full of magic, which shows that even the gods can't save the price." If you think like this, the magic will continue to exist forever. Roland seriously explained, "And the magic will last forever, and you will not suddenly disappear." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," the night owl went too far. "It seems a bit reasonable." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this year's evil month has passed more than three months, but there have been no new witches. Who should blame?" "Anna smiles like a smile.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this--" he paused for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, no kidding. Anna smirked out, "If we follow this inference, after the emergence of the battle of divine war and the promotion of the ethnic group, the magic world emerged, and eventually formed the world we are now familiar with." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" From a logical point of view, you can think so. After all, the inheritance of fragments and the ideology are inseparable from the magic, and the various relics discovered in reality prove that there were other civilizations before we appeared. Roland sighed. "I now care about two things. One is the sphere that is gradually merged and covered by the prismatic light under the red hollow. The second is the liberation of the pursuit of the mouth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you suspect that the former is the planet we live in?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded. "If you can fly up and take a look, it’s fine... Unfortunately, without the current technical level of Winter City, I want to verify this. It is more difficult. As for the so-called liberation, it is bound to be related to the suspension of the war of the gods, but what this means in the end, I am afraid that only when we enter the bottomless world can we really know. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought that a huge organization like the martial arts association, even if it was reached The initial consensus, the procedure is also a very long thing, I am afraid that I can't make a decent charter for ten days and a half. Instead of waiting for the specific results of the high-level, it is better to ask a few requests first, such as focusing on the book. Provide technical information, as well as professional training for the Santa Cruz, blossoming and other Takira witches.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the facts are greatly beyond his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other day, when he entered the dream again that night, he received a call from Garcia.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The secretary of Mr. Lanshi let me inform you that Prism City has negotiated and passed the first assistance plan. The specific implementation of the plan requires your participation. The meeting place is at the new energy car of Sanye Group. City Project Department. If there is no other arrangement, we will leave now. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
