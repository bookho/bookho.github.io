			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you handed the license to me, you didn't say that, Roland secretly groaned. "How do you feel that you are introducing new members? The task of destroying the demons is to be based on the old ones?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old-style People are really more, but..." Garcia pointed to a few guys who were no different from passers-by. "They have almost no detailed information. They usually go into a mystery. In addition to their respective connectors, other members of the association know it. Very few, I don’t even want to introduce it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but help, if not pointed out by the other party, he thought that The uncle is a driver or a miscellaneous assistant of the star martial arts family. Not to mention strength, the gap between appearance and clothing is too big. Not attending the martial arts conference does not mean giving up the image! When I thought of being the winner of the life that was shining all over the old side, and acting as a spokesperson for a group of uncles, he suddenly had the urge to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you still have time to sign up for the Budo Conference trials? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a black bus drove into the parking lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was the car from Prism City," Garcia said. "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Well." Roland patted his right shoulder - this whispered way to let the witches keep up. As long as the worms of Falcon have been attached to him, the witch can't lose the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bus, the two went straight to the last row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure enough, it's the best for me," he separated his legs and leaned back in his chair. "Sitting here is like sitting on the throne, not only can you Looking down on all living beings, you can still see everything in the car."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The house will speak straight." Garcia disdain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." How do you let others chat? "I don't seem to be asking you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The first time the younger perform the task, the seniors naturally have to look at it."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the two eyes wide open their eyes, there was a sudden bang in the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Fijian, I have a seat here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sit with me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the girl who was named as a genius in the bus, everyone sent out an invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that even if they are all star martial arts, there is a difference in treatment..." Roland exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." The two reached an agreement on this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, she did not accept anyone’s offer, but instead walked towards the second half of the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here, no one is sitting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing cold points to the position around Roland Asked in a flat voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Garcia looked at her with amazement and looked at Roland, as if she wanted to understand the relationship between the two sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland himself is also confused, completely unable to understand what the other party is thinking. Feeling the sight of other people in the car, he coughed twice uncomfortably, "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Fiji nodded coldly. I took it for granted. "First time meet, or ... meet for the second time. Hello, my name is Fiji, and I would like to ask more advice on this mission."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, The advice is not called, my name is Roland, this is... Miss Garcia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the introduction, the atmosphere was silent for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of eye-catching feelings were relieved until the bus started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was planning to change his position with Garcia, Fiji suddenly turned his head and his lips whispered, "...kr?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噗通."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia's phone suddenly fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also stunned. He stared at the other party for a long time. After a long time, he began to say, "You-"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon everyone, I am the liaison officer C02 who is the supporter of this action and support. Everyone calls me 02." However, he has not waited for him to ask for an exit, a microphone The suit man interrupted his words. "In the following period, I will give you a detailed introduction to the goals and plans of this joint annihilation mission. If you have any questions, please be sure to ask me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This also makes Roland only able to press the words and focus on the liaison officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to intelligence, the recent movements of the demon have become more active and have begun to show a tendency to collective action, which in the past records meant erosion. The association is close, and the association has obtained reliable clues and found that some of the demon people intend to hold a rally in an abandoned factory in the southern suburbs. The specific purpose is unknown, but there is no doubt that it is not a good thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe they just want to make a friend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Hua’s words caused a shallow sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If that's the case, then it's fine." The suit man did not show any intolerance. "Unfortunately, the demon is our biggest enemy, so it is still It’s safer to die. The abandoned factory has an underground road that can be reached directly, but after the factory is closed, the road is also blocked. The association secretly opened the road two days ago, so that we can directly enter the enemy center. In order not to stun the snake, the action is scheduled to be at 9:00 pm, and the relevant equipment will be issued when getting off the bus."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, the government forces will cooperate with us from the ground. Actions to prevent the demon from escaping, but only those who have awakened the power of nature can cause damage to these monsters. Therefore, we must also be divided into two teams, one team responsible for destroying the demon, and the other team responsible for chasing the leak. The list of teams has been placed under the tables and chairs of all of you. If there are no problems, we will follow this plan..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very interesting, Fijian Impassively turned the list, the mind is not completely on paper, but think back to look again at Roland hear "Your Majesty." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the average person is exposed on the spot, what should be felt first, should it be embarrassing and angry? Although the latter kind of emotion will rarely be revealed in front of her face, unless she is prepared, she will not miss any small expression changes and the cover behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on the other side, she saw an extremely complicated look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be surprised, alert, confused, and even a little happy... There was a moment when she noticed that the other person opened her mouth and seemed to want to blurt out something. But soon it was suppressed again. Judging from the mouth shape, it should be "Ai" sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reaction is difficult to explain with common sense - Roland is clearly the first time to know her, whether it is negative or not, should not start with this word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, there is no such thing as the existence of jealousy in these emotions. That is to say, he has long been accustomed to this title? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fisher can't help but think of the words that were captured during the last banquet - at the time she only used those conversations as a play, but now she is somewhat uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king of the two worlds...? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the curiosity at the beginning is only because of "want to separate from each other", now more interested in her has become Roland itself. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This decision to participate in the joint action is really the right choice, she thought. The master once said that the history of the martial arts association is far older than she imagined. The mystery of mastery is comparable to that of the stars in the sky. Some of them even involve the origin of the world, but only a few people can know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
