			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The command of the Great Retreat was spread under the wing of the Flying Courier and soon spread around the cage mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that as long as there is a place where the Grey Fortress exists, this instruction has been executed to the maximum extent. There is no shirking and no fooling. The time of half a year is enough for those who have worked hard to understand the style of Roland Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even they themselves are amazed by the "power" they have shown themselves - the seemingly impossible requirements of the past, in the current situation of all-out All of them were attacked one by one. When they encountered problems, thought about problems, and solved problems, the same group of people produced different effects under different systems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Baron Bet is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the busy atmosphere in his house, his heart is full of flavors. He thought that he was just a small family with lack of ability and ambition. Because he did not pose a threat to the Wolf King, or the fangs and the Red Stone Gate, they would allow themselves to manage the Shenchi Bay all the time to maintain the big family. A delicate balance. But now, his bachelor and his men are coordinating the turnover of tens of thousands of people in the port, as well as the scheduling of thousands of ships - although a large part of them are Fishing boats, but small ships need to be docked to load and unload. The former is equivalent to the total population of an inland big city, and the latter is even more than the number of merchant ships along the entire wolf heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is normal, the Baron will not think that his family has the ability to control such a big situation, if anyone mentions, he will only feel that the other party is either joking, Either it is not clear how complicated the management in management is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let Bate find that he not only underestimated his own level, but also underestimated the ability of the tribe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as you are forced to do so, supplemented by the right leadership and rules and regulations, people can be squeezed out of such amazing potential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, he played more for the Grey Fortress because of the helpless choice. After all, the fate of the family was controlled by others, and it was not done. But gradually, he found that he liked this feeling. With one command going on, thousands of people will work together to solve the task efficiently and accurately, as if this is the true meaning of power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though he has more "superior" on his head than before, the concept of holding power is clearer than in the past - he believes, Their subordinates also have similar feelings, which can be seen from their busy but energetic faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading 10,000 fools is better than leading a hundred smart people, I am afraid it is the baron's most profound experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these systems that are very different from the "nobility", you can turn a previously bad person into a smart person, and the real smart person can How much power does he play for him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jean Bate has no doubt that Roland Wimbledon will eventually become the head of the four countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——As long as human beings can survive the battle of divine power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides being busy with the top managers, civil action is equally hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This benefited from the performance of the gray castle in the evacuation operation, the promise of compensation, so that its announcement has a very high prestige. I heard that the First Army offered high prices to reward those who transferred soldiers and weapons for the Grey Fort. Those who had the ability to share a piece of the whole all acted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first response is the group of people who lived by the sea - the sailors who used to rent a horse-drawn carriage and specialized in land transportation, now all Back to the main business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the fishermen. Since the conditions for the first army were based on the number of people and the weight of the materials, and the straits between the Dagong Island and the land were not wide, let alone the single-masted sailing, many people moved the ancestral rafts. There are no sails and paddles to use. As long as you can draw a round-trip between the straits, it is the income of several Jinlong. Whoever counts this account will count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
