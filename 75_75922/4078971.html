If things interfere, the situation is more complicated - the bottom of the pit just happens to have a large stone of the gods, and if it is a trap placed by the enemy, it is too dangerous for the rescuers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stalking animals that have come and gone, and the worm carriers that have swallowed the devil's stone tower, are all hidden in this snowy mountain. Losing the warning of the nightingale and Sylvie, as well as the cover of the First Army, even if the gods of the witches are not seen, they can bring Fulan back smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the adventure itself is full of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A qualified explorer should not see his companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me go down and see," she walked up to the dispute. "No matter what to do next, you must first find out what is going on at the bottom of the hole." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your ability is..." The blond man turned and asked. Lightning remembers that the name of the other person seems to be called Elena. Although the body is male, the soul is an unrelenting Takula ancient witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flight," she knocked on the goggles above her head. "In this case, I am going to explore more advantages than you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not an inconvenient problem," Aegusa frowned. "If you can't use the hole at the end, how do you get back? Your Majesty said that this search will never allow Separate action, whether it is the Witch Alliance or Taqila, must be steadily advanced with the cooperation of the First Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hang a hang on my waist The rope is just fine," Lightning trayd out his thoughts. "If it's a forbidden zone made by the stone of God's punishment, I won't have any serious problems. As long as you find the rope hanging down the wall, pull me straight up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explorer does not give up the companion does not mean reckless behavior, when she was a child, she heard a lot of thrilling incidents, as long as it was handled properly, most accidents Can be risky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even without magic, she is still the most outstanding explorer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me follow," said the nightingale. "There is no point in the foggy world. I can easily walk on the cliffs, even if there are enemies. I can also cover her back for the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the difference between this and individual action?" Wendy shook her head again and again. "In case there is a trap below, you guys." The two don't even care, don't forget that there are still powerful enemies like the high-end devil in the world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will never leave Fran No matter, if you don't go, let's go by ourselves!" Elena said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For four hundred years, have you forgotten the obedience of the command?" Aegis’s voice is also serious. In the name of the witch, you are not allowed to act without permission!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Hearing this sentence, all the goddess of witches are silent, and Elena bites. Bite the lips, and finally withdraw two steps backwards, press the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't have to argue about this kind of thing," Isis said suddenly. "According to your majesty, the exploration must be coordinated, so you only need to It’s fine to send the first army, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Are you finding the way to go?” said the head of the first army, Brian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't find the way, but I found this," she pointed to a cliff on the edge of the hole, which appeared on the rock wall under the reflection of the torch. The flashing light spot - that is the chopping light reflected by the flowing water. "The cement boat used to cook porridge has a lifting device. I often see them hoisting food directly from other supply vessels instead of carrying it by hand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Ah... you are talking about the basket system," Brian nodded. "It does handle a lot of cargo at once, but it has to be driven by a steam engine..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
