			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no curtain, no speech, only a piece of wood separates the front desk from the preparation room. A group of people perform drama for the first time on such a simple stage. This is their life. The first official performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The story takes place in the kingdom of a kingdom, in the outer city, there is a beautiful and kind girl..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the narration, Irene slowly walked to the stage. She was wearing a dirty gray robes, her hair was on the top of her head, and her face was black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swinging the broom in the hand, she carefully cleaned the ground, bending her waist from time to time, wiping the dirt that was difficult to remove with the corner of the robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several days of rehearsal, the entire plot process Irene has been meticulous. The story is very simple. A civilian woman who lost her mother was bullied at home, but she saved a witch because of her kindness, and let the witch show her magic to send her to the prince's dance party and fall in love with the prince. Her magic time is limited, she had to leave the ball in a hurry, leaving a crystal shoe in the panic. In order to find this beautiful girl, the prince did not hesitate to search the whole city and eventually found her in the outer city. After that, the two lived happily together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story is simple and understandable, and the plot changes the love of the princess and the prince. The civilian woman wins the prince with the help of the good nature. Favor. As the protagonist of this play, Cinderella, from the tolerance to the courage to resist, under the oppression, is also the place where the actors need to focus on performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Irene never imagined that Mey actually gave the heroine position to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itâ€™s just that the Star of the West is willing to perform with her, she feels very happy, and as the pillar of the Fortress Theatre, Mey has enough pride and The qi is the protagonist in any drama. In Cinderella, she takes the initiative to ask the sister who is the protagonist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Irene somewhat unbelievable, until the other side repeatedly stressed that this is a newcomer's performance, Irene took the role of Cinderella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next rehearsal, she was full of energy, not only practicing each scene repeatedly, but also teaching Mey, who was wrapped in the same bed after the candle was extinguished. Skills, just to live up to the other party's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, Irene is not inexperienced, looking at the eyes of countless people, she relaxes and reproduces the repeatedly practiced content. So far, she feels that she is in good shape and has not made any mistakes. When she plays the witch's Luo Xia nervous and forgets the words, she also uses the eyes to encourage each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will divide the porridge into half, don't eat too fast, it is very hot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Thank you for your kindness, little girl, I will repay you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Xia squats back to the background, the crowds have whipped up Palm - this makes Irene relieved. To know that if you forget the words in the official performance of the fortress theater, it is absolutely intolerable. The nobles will only laugh at the actor with a snoring, instead of giving good applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Mey was on the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story is the first conflict between a mean sister and Cinderella. Under the pressure and insult of her sister, the latter can only be in tears, hiding in the basement. The mother's portrait muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the other person stood in front of him, Irene suddenly found that the atmosphere on the field suddenly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is no longer the star of the theater that was whispering in the rehearsal, and became the ruler on the stage. Her high-spirited attitude, just the right physical movements, and the unrecognized contempt in her eyes made Irene feel a strong sense of oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, see who this is? Don't work during the day, what are you thinking about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You don't have a poor worm, don't hurry to clean my dress!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't be clumsy, this is The formal banquet dress, you can't afford it if you break it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
