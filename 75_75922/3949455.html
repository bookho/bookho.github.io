			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the moment Roland was hit, the nightingale felt his heart suddenly tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noisy surrounding voice instantly became very distant. She wanted to lift the other side in the past, but found that her body was cold and stiff, her hands trembled slightly, except for the initial subconscious shock. In addition to the voice, it is extremely difficult to take a step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is afraid that Roland will gradually lose temperature in her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is afraid that he will never wake up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just thinking about this, it makes the nightingale difficult to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the moment she has memories, she has never been so helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Anna was the first to react - she squatted and covered a whole black wound with a black fire, and the flames of the light burst into flames. White smoke, while emitting a sizzling sound. When the black fire dissipated, Roland's broken arm had been burnt into a group of burnt black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flow of blood stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is the emergency measure he talked about in the first aid class. What should I do next? Wrap the wound and quickly go to the hospital to find Nana... The night snoring and swallowing, sweeping the basket, no, no, Nana Wa is not on the hot air balloon, but in the town of Bentham. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must get back as soon as possible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slowly turned her head to the southeast of the town -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time The look of the devil's claws and claws once again reflected in the eyes of the night, and pulled all her thoughts back to the hanging basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches panicked, the gunshots, and the low roar of the enemy returned to their ears. After the cold subsided, the thoughts in the mind finally gathered together. In a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't beat the devil, you can't get back to Bianbu Town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning!" Anna Anxiously shouted, "Protect the hot air balloon to land!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl looked pale, but looked at the unconscious Roland, still nodded, Flying out of the gondola. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, night sly, just look at her appearance and know that she can't deal with the devil. Like most witches, lightning has no experience of fighting real enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can beat the devil here is himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale took a deep breath and forced himself to put aside the scene of the injury of His Royal Highness Prince. The two devils are still in the front and back. The arm of the spear is as thin as a firewood, and it may take a long time to fully recover. The other party is about 50 meters away from the hot air balloon. This distance is not enough. It is easy to fall into the fog in the sky. The higher the ground, the less the "line" that flashes past. Time stays on a line, and when you change direction and up and down, you are likely to be torn into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the enemy also realized that once the hot air balloon landed, things could get tricky. A devil waved his left hand with only three fingers and shouted loudly. What, then it pulled up the mount underneath and rushed straight toward the hot air balloon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other one slammed into the lightning, and the evil beast that swept the huge wings was like a falcon that caught the nestling, which made her evade for a while. . As the nightingale expected, lightning can hardly aim at the other side in addition to relying on flexible movements. Other witches were even afraid of accidentally injuring the little girl and stopped shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil who went to the hot air balloon drove the mount to the airbag and grabbed it. Fortunately, Soroya’s coating was tough enough to mix the evil beasts. The claws and teeth are hard to embed. Seeing this trick is invalid, it roared and flew to the distance for a while, and seemed to want to use the impact to make the hot air balloon out of balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfolding the fog, when a tiny light-emitting thin line appeared on the top of the head, she stepped on without hesitation, standing on the airbag while holding the moment of the contour change of the hot air balloon. Although the body was parallel to the ground, she seemed to be flat and quickly climbed to the top of the balloon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil is just coming straight at this time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the black and white world, the nightingale was surprised to find that there was a sparse magical cyclone spinning slowly in the other body, and the thin arms were still embedded. A sparkling stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have magic? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now is not the time to pay attention to this, the sprint distance of more than ten meters for her is only a short moment, when the devil is about to hit the hot air balloon, nightingale Jumping out of the fog, the devil has appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant wing evil beast suddenly increased due to the weight of the burden, the body suddenly sinks, the devil seems to be aware of something, violently turned back, greeted it It is the roar of a 12 mm caliber pistol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullet rushed out of the flame and the smoke of the package, carrying Wan Hao It penetrated into the devil's head and opened a large hole in the back of the head. The viscous blood splashes everywhere, and a pungent smell spreads out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy twitched and fell, and the evil beast deflected its direction and swept from the side of the hot air balloon. The accident happened when the nightingale wanted to fold back to the top of the airbag. The slanted corpse drove the reins, and the mount suddenly rolled over and rolled her out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, she has left the safe distance to return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the hot air balloon has been reducing its height, it is still hundreds of meters away from the sea at this moment. When you fall into the fog and commit suicide - if you can't control your posture, you will be cut in half on any thin line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard the sisters yelling in panic, but everything is fine No compensation. Lightning is fighting with the devil, and even if the wheat is turned into a sea eagle, she is unable to pull herself up. She is very clear about the ending that will be faced next. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the fall is getting faster and faster, the nightingale looks down, the original ambiguous ocean has revealed its true face, the rolling water and the waves It’s getting clearer – it’s not that she is falling, but the sea is accelerating to hit her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, her mind became more and more clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale closed his eyes, and the piece that met Roland seemed to reappear in front of her. She sat on the edge of the bed, playing with the dagger in her hand, waiting for the gray prince Push in the door. The swaying fire, the door panel and the bedroom gradually disappeared, leaving only the smiling face of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only regret is that there is no way to accompany him to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕咕咕咕!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a series of high-pitched tweets came from the ear . At night, she opened her eyes and saw a white figure rushing down to her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is Mai Mai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just wanted to say something, the pigeons were shot with a dazzling white light, and the figure swelled instantly, and a pair of huge meat wings opened from the back. The feathers have fallen off and the bird's head has become awkward, looking exactly like a flying evil beast! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“嗷————————!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 is deafening The two claws seize the nightingale and forcefully throw it up. The latter rolled a half circle in the air, falling straight on the back of the wide bird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the hell is going on? The nightingale was completely stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" McMug turned his head and shouted again, seeming to remind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
