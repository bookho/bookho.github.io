			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord's Castle, the First Army Camp, and the Third Side of the City received the news almost simultaneously - these days, Roland added two more short lines. The commander of the defending army and the remnants of Taqila can contact him for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is too fast," Pasha’s voice had some doubts. "According to previous experience, their second threat should be half a month to one. After the month, especially in cities like No Winter that cannot be reached within a day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the fermentation of public opinion. When the news spreads, no matter what commitment the lord made, the second attack will further dispel the confidence of the mortal, so during this period Waiting is necessary," Pasha explained. "The devil's action seems to be too urgent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out," Roland nodded. Indeed, for an ancient city, the five-day news may also be spread between underground mice and several pubs. Those who are busy for a meal only have a level of information that is not imaginable by modern people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now believes a bit about the ancient rumors that Pasha said, after all, the other side’s approach is too human-like, if not someone is pointing behind, the devil How did you understand this level in the human world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do?" Elk interjected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can I do, of course, kill them!" Roland did not hesitate. Although this time was quite rushed, the new sights were loaded onto the Mark One yesterday. The temporarily selected machine gun team only used a balloon to do a simulated shooting, but the witches also came back a lot. With nightingales, lightning and wheat stubble, this time is at least not passive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks to the night owl and others, "You can do as scheduled, remember that the most important thing is always..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Safety. Lightning fully understands!" The little girl raised her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mc茜 also understands!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, I will look after these two Little guy," said the nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the little guy?" Lightning refused to hold his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course you are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am bigger than you add up! Hey!" Mai Hao made a wing-wing action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not talking about this - ah."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two did not finish talking, I was taken by the nightingale and took out the meeting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The defense work on the wall is then handed over to the Sleeping Island witch," Roland said to Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter should have come down, "They will do their best."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok, I will stay in front of the phone and wait for the good news from everyone," he said one word at a time. "Now, act!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until the conference hall only When Roland was left alone, Pasha said with a deep voice. "Do you really intend to do this? The large number of witches will make the devil modify the previous judgment - this is not a city ruled by mortals, but a city of witches. Their countermeasures will be completely different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have reminded me of this." Roland took a sigh of relief. In the previous development of the defensive plan, the ancient witch once said that if the devil thinks that no winter is a holy city led by the federation, in the future, no matter whether it is prepared or attacked, it will be upgraded to a level, that is, according to normal opponents. In other words, the devil did not put ordinary people in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought... The human kingdom can always avoid this war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
