			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s just right, I just have something to look for." After the call was connected, he hadn’t spoken yet, and there was a call from him. The voice of West Asia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The phone said it was inconvenient, in my room Come and see it. Anyway, you just get up soon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the receiver, Roland can feel the sorrow of the other party, as if relying on a bed It is a sinful act for martial arts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... well," he thought for a while, decided to go to 0827 to explore the tone first. If Jiaxia was in a bad mood, he could Choose to talk again in the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hang up the phone, Roland ordered the three witches to wait in the living room for a while, then one came to the door of 0827. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The door is not closed, come in." Garcia apparently heard his footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pushes the door into the living room and sees that the other person is wearing a loose summer dress, holding two glasses in front of the refrigerator. The wet gray long hair spilled on the shoulders, the tiny sweat beads still hung on the tip of the nose, and a pair of cartoon flip-flops on the foot. At the moment, she is not like a serious martial artist. It is more like a Ordinary college students who enjoy summer vacation, "What do you want to drink? Boiled water, tea, cola... all have ice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the actual age of Garcia is different from oneself. This is not big, the difference of up to two or three years old, he thought. If you weren’t originally set up by the Dream World to drop out of school, work in a bar, and lose your job, you’re still in school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coke." Roland replied casually. "Have you finished your morning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Do you think that you are so lazy like you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was slightly stagnation, obviously so undefended, but he spoke as if he had just met, not ironic It’s uncomfortable, it’s a miracle to be able to live in peace now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, I have known for a long time, at least a little Roland can be sure, that is, the mood of the other party at the moment is not bad... even good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it related to what she is going to say? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, iced green tea." Garcia put the drink in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just said it was Coke..." Roland picked an eyebrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't have morning exercises, you should drink less sugary drinks." She seems to suppress the smile, a serious saying, "The evolution of the power of nature." It has nothing to do with the body type, even if it looks thin, it can also explode a powerful force. This also means that it can't help you reshape your body. If you want to go on stage, you should pay attention to it. The shapely martial artist It is always more popular than obese martial artists."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, you should not list this option! Roland rolled his eyes and asked without hesitation. "So? You told me not to talk about the figure? And I said, no matter what the star martial arts or the contest, I have no interest at all. To eradicate evil and protect the world, you only need to carry, do not need fame, let me be a silent guardian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are famous Wherever you go, you will be recognized, how can you go to the house to rob? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unbelievable..." Garcia’s voice suddenly dropped a lot. She watched Roland slowly. "I thought this was the least likely to be from you." Speaking it out - of course, the master taught me not to look at what one is saying, but to see what a person does. If you don't know what you did, I guess it will only be considered as shameless. The bragging can be biased... but it is true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland naturally understands what the other party is saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since having tasted the sweetness of the murderer, he and the Taqila witch have cleaned up the hidden low-level demon in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the association is also monitoring the movements of the demon. If they find that a large number of demon people are inexplicably dying, and the power of nature is not known, it will cause a round of vibration, and it will be troublesome when it comes to him. Therefore, it is better to take the initiative to give up a part of the clearly exposed targets more secure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the general order and erosion commission issued by the association, he also received the most positive. According to Garcia, he is the most newcomer to the demon. One, even more than a few regular members. And there is intelligence that the demon person has realized the emergence of a strong enemy and is trying to find out his identity and whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he cast a stone in the prism city and the demon group, which is enough to stir up the ripples, but in ordinary martial arts and the public But no name. If Garcia is a guide in the area, she will not know what he has done every time Roland wants to turn in the power of nature to contact her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough...there is nothing in the matter," Roland cleared his throat. "Is this not the responsibility of the martial artist?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Garcia laughed rarely. "This is the responsibility of the martial arts." She took a piece of paper from the coffee table and handed it to him. "Congratulations. You have become a full member of the martial arts association. This is a new contract sent today, and the name will be valid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I remember to solve it alone The loss of an erosion event can become a full member. As a result, I have not completed ten or eight tasks. The administrative efficiency of Prism City is really low enough." Roland pouted and put himself at the end of the contract. name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because...the martial arts association is an international organization."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then Is it like you now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Garcia shook her head and pushed another small book over. "Accurately, it is in my Up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland curiously opened the little book, could not help but glimpse, "This is--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hunting license." She put away her smile and said in a word, "It is only granted to those who have outstanding talents in battle and who are determined to fight evil. This city has it." There are no more than ten martial arts homes, and the license issued by Prism City is about a hundred. As for its use and precautions, it is written at the end of the book - remember, it is the trust of the association and also represents Greater responsibility, I hope that you can continue on this road until humanity wins the final victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original... She is happy about this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the newcomers who are recruited by themselves, the average person may be lost, or feel embarrassed, unruly, etc.... but in the eyes of Garcia Not all of these negative emotions - she is happy from the heart, as if she had received this honor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Roland faintly worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Garcia’s perception of him is at its highest point, but the more so, the greater the pressure on this expectation. He knows that the other side is indifferent, but the heart is very sense of justice, otherwise it will not help the residents of the package to fight against the three-leaf group. When he thinks about the misunderstanding that may arise later, he feels very big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, what did you call me before?" Garcia casually drank the tea. "I have to explain everything, you Looking for me will not be predicting this in advance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm... there are some things," Roland replied with a hard scalp. "You can go to me." Is there a room for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiasia glanced at him in confusion. "There is nothing wrong with it, but can't you say it here?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You will know when you come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took a deep breath and took the other party back to 0825. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the living room, the three witches suddenly turned their eyes on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
