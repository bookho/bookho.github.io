			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the news of the throne ceremony was released, Roland handed over all preparations to Barov, who also looked extraordinarily, not only daily Busy and busy, but also let the old ceremonial officer Ms. Blanche invited to the winter, obviously not willing to appear a trace of omission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for himself, except for occasionally going to check the shooting progress of the next Shadow, the rest of the time was put into the final setting of the internal combustion engine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there are certain errors in the weights and measures of the two worlds, the prototypes need to pass the stability test, plus the oils that are fractionated are uneven, design redundancy It is also necessary to consider things. In the absence of immersive calculation methods, he can only use physical objects for debugging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing-Experiment-Retirement-Improvement-Repetition, Roland seems to have returned to the campus era, running between the castle and the northern slopes every day. Through a busy and fulfilling research life, the knowledge that has never been touched for a long time has become clear again in this half-month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there was no Anna companion at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More beautifully, her passion for new things is no less than her own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever she saw her focus on assembling the precision parts and the scent of the sweat on the tip of her nose, Roland would not help Giving birth to emotions - her desire for creation and seeking knowledge seems to be born, just like her flame, burning and pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inner spirit is beyond the scope of what the profence can describe, and it never stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever a decisive progress is made, Anna’s smile can be described with almost everything – he even thinks that the joy of creation is for her. Words far more than becoming a queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has never concealed her own thoughts - as long as the two can stay together, she is not too concerned about the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, Roland also knows that sometimes the name is not for the show, but for everyone to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as humans are still social animals, this cannot be avoided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After marking a series of revised dimensions on the drawing, he put down the quill and licked some numb neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If nothing else, these designs are likely to be finalized - after all, the last batch of prototypes have been running stably for several days, accumulating work Time has been able to meet current usage needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a second-generation power source, the principle of an internal combustion engine is not complicated and can be regarded as an evolutionary version of a steam engine. The first generation of power source is driven by steam to push the piston. No matter how cleverly designed, the energy loss caused by steam transportation cannot be avoided. Therefore, people naturally think that putting this force directly into the cylinder will inevitably greatly improve work efficiency. The internal combustion engine was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil is mixed with air and injected into the cylinder to cause it to burn violently. The expanded air will push the piston and simultaneously draw new fuel into the cylinder— - Sounds simple, but it's a huge project. For example, the steam engine has a relatively low sealing requirement. The gap between the piston and the cylinder of the early product can even be inserted into a finger. Both felt and linen can be used for caulking, but it is obviously not feasible to change to an internal combustion engine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not powered by the outside like a steam engine. Every cycle of the piston needs to be done by itself. Therefore, if the seal is not tight, the cylinder will be short. The fire stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, this simple principle can only be turned into reality when material levels and processing techniques reach a certain level. It is precisely because of this that the birth time of the first internal combustion engine in history was actually several decades later than the electric motor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland designed the first generation of internal combustion engine solutions in two directions, one is cylinder in-line and the other is cylinder ring type. The former is stupid, black and thick, and cast iron is built. How to make it steady, and strive to put it into the factory for large-scale production. The latter, also known as the star engine, can be made very compact due to its short crankshaft and compact structure, making it ideal for spacecraft applications. It is much more refined than the former as a whole, and the material is aluminum alloy, which can only be processed by Anna for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with the information revealed by the high-level devil, he also had to speed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground defense alone, it is difficult to make dripping water in the face of a large number of threats from the sky. This expedition has already proved this point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plan can be achieved, human beings will be qualified for the first time in the air to compete with the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, don't move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland immediately paused while his eyes were aiming backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there an enemy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he saw the nightingale coming over and reached over his head, then a slight pain, she put a strand of hair in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, this is white hair?" Roland was a little bit smirking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the gray hair color itself is very shallow, but these hairs are indeed somewhat white, almost lost luster from the roots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And," the nightingale fumbled for a while. "Have you been resting too little recently?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You used to sleep late in the winter, have recently started earlier than me, and have to enter the dream world at night, that Can't you really fall asleep?" She screamed. "It's a sign of fatigue when you yawn from time to time. You haven't gotten white hair until you are thirty, so go on."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at each other’s face, Roland’s heart can’t help but be a little lighter. Even the fatigue of working with it has faded a bit. She really didn’t get too much influence. It seems that the appointment It does play a vital role. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, this is far from the limit. I have already experienced this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"..." The nightingale looked suspicious, but apparently she could tell that this was not a lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he did not lie, "In general, there will be a long period of palpitations, as if the chest is particularly empty; then feel like If you don't feel good, you should be careful at this time. If the reaction is strong, you will cough up, even the blood - cough and cough -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking halfway, he suddenly coughed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, are you okay?" The nightingale suddenly showed a nervous look and patted his back. "Do you need me to call Nana?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland took a deep breath. "No...nothing, I just got caught in the saliva."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Real?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassure, I--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Turning around, they couldn't help but froze - the distance between them was almost close, and in the eyes of the four eyes, the two couldn't help but hold their breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty," At this moment, the office door was pushed open, and Wendy came in. "I have one thing... um? You What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" Roland blinked and found that there was no one in front of him, and he kept a half-back posture, even if not to say I also know that it must be quite weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’m practicing gymnastics," I don’t know when I’m lying on the side of the coffee table, and I’m so eager to chew on the dried fish. It’s so easy to get sore for a long time, he just can try the effect first.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s the same,” Wendy thought, “This is Have you mentioned the gymnastics that you are going to promote in the college? But... is it really effective?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
