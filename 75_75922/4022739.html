			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the 1,500 soldiers who performed the tooth extraction operation boarded the ship and headed for a looting target: Chishui City. At the same time, in accordance with the guidelines set at the strategic meeting, other First Army soldiers also continued to escort ammunition and food to the north, they will Inside the 6 water network, in turn through the Chishui River, Wangdu Canal and Sanwan River, and finally arrived in the Valley Town. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to cope with such a large-scale marching deployment, in addition to the open-boats without the winter city all invested in the mission, Roland also rented thirty to the Margaret Chamber of Commerce. A sailboat used to transport war materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, he can deliver 3,000 soldiers and corresponding artillery ammunition to the north in a month, that is, before the arrival of July. . In the later generations, the scale of transshipment of thousands of people is likely to be completed by three or four inland river passenger liners, but in this era, it is an incredible initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tooth extraction operation gets enough stone of the gods, the leading troops will also go to the north, and finally the valley town will gather 4,500 people, forced The church opened in the cold wind ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the contingency plan is not without it. One situation is that the church is dispatched extraordinarily fast, for example, let a small part of the gods punished without logistical light assault, along the desperate The mountains go all the way down to the winter city. Another situation is that the enemy does not give up the holy city, and enters the kingdom from the junction of the morning light and the gray fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 500 people who stayed in the Winter City alone were prepared to guard against the former. The defending city warfare always had certain advantages, especially with the support of the 152mm Fortress. The latter is a double loser, the first army has to turn into a war of attrition, the church will lose the holy city of Hermes, the faith and status are severely frustrated, and the gray castle will also lose a large population. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the probability of occurrence in the second case is very small, the church has no roots in the Holy City, and the lost population of the Grey Castle can still have a chance to revive. If you are mad, you will not use this suicide method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the first fleet leaving Northland Pearl Isis Kant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please rest assured, I will write to my father, let him take out half of the grain in the north for the soldiers to use, and the lords of Glen Valley will do their best. Cooperate with all the requirements of the First Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you go back to the North?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to follow the first army to participate in all the next battles," said Isis, standing on the side of the ship and raising her hand. Then I will go to the chest and salute. "My brother will ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will take care of him."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, then, I will wait for you in Glentown - on the occasion of the real battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the departure of the vessel, The voice of the nightmare dissatisfaction was thought of in Roland's ear. "Hey, it is a war of life and death, but she said that she is dating a lover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough... "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't see it? The movement of the head...there is no wind now, it's just like this." The night screamed coldly, "Of course, It is not excluded that she has long been used to making such gestures to men. It is already an instinct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you still worried about the letter?" "Roland laughs and laughs." Shaking his head, "It’s impossible to say it. Right, is she reliable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale reluctantly replied, "There is basically no problem. At least, when expressing loyalty and talking about those combat plans, it’s all about the truth.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is enough,” Roland said. "Let's go back to the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, there is no winter city facing the pressure brought by the war, but there are many good news - the moon of the demon When the planned project 6 was completed, the infrastructure construction ushered in the stage of the result of the blowout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that the West has finally won its own estuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
