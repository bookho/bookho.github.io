			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fortress Shuguang City, Guanxingtai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fall of Tiefco, there is no name for the king in this place. The bachelor of the star school thought it would usher in a turmoil, but the city order was not too raw. More changes. People are still busy with their own lives - the farmers are farming the fields in the suburbs, the stonemasons repairing the damaged walls, the blacksmiths are beating the armor of the shop, and the patrols continue to play the game of cats and mice with the black street sluts. It is still one of the most prosperous cities in the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is no change at all. For example, every day someone will leave the old king and go to the west to seek new opportunities. The old rival of the astrology association, the Wangdu Alchemy Association, moved away from Shuguang City. Now the palace has been replaced by a group of unknown aristocrats who have been squandering the land and power left by the old aristocrats all day long and completely throwing the sages aside. No one asked about the fate of the kingdom, and no one was divining the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for the officials left by Roland, they would regularly give the astrologer a grain and a golden dragon, and I’m afraid the apprentices would have been scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, they can still maintain the operation of the association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the astrology still exists, the mission of the bachelors will not be suspended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Always look up at the stars." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun slowly sinks into the mountains to the west, the sky turns from orange to dark red, and finally to deep purple... After nightfall, the work of astrologers just began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-rise oil lamp was ignited on the high platform, and the apprentices carried a star-gauge instrument from the warehouse—they must be very careful and damage the carelessness of the instrument. Will face the double punishment of whipping and deducting salary, especially the stargazer sent by Luo Lan, which is the treasure of the baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bachelor of Stars did not take it too seriously when he first got these instruments in wooden boxes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that Mr. has promised to bring more advanced stargazing tools to astrology, but the production of instruments is an extremely complicated process. It is different from the shoddy lookout mirror. The activity mechanism that can adjust the distance inside the barrel can make the most skilled craftsmen have a headache for the first half of the month, not to mention the polishing of the crystal lens. It takes about one year from the selection of materials to the production of a stargazer, and the Golden Dragon is about 100 pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is anything in common with the study of the sages, then both are very costly, but the products obtained by alchemy are often subject to the nobility and The wealthy merchants welcome, astrology is not so lucky, so only a country's capital has the financial resources and people to build a stargazing station. As far as he knows, Bianbu Town in the West was a ruined barren land two years ago. Even if the four wars plundered a lot of money, who would be willing to give these golden dragons to unrelated asteroids? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the wooden box was taken apart, the diffuse star was stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first to see such a star-gazing tool - unlike the bamboo-like instrument used in the association, its metal barrel is full of bucket size The glass mirror embedded in it can shine brightly, and no matter how close it is, no trace of sanding can be found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its activity organization is also designed to be quite clever, just a thumb with a large thumb at the end - as long as the pinch is gently rotated, the lens can be realized The distance is adjusted, and it is not necessary to lock it again after adjusting the distance, which is very convenient to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland 66下66 continued to send three batches of six new stargazers, and gave it an easy-to-understand name: "Astronomical Telescope" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the use of the diffuse star once, it is no longer willing to look at the old-fashioned instruments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining five telescopes were naturally handed over to the five most astrologers in the astrology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, all stargazing instruments have been placed in place." The big disciple reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the star distinguished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
