			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the nail suddenly tightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment seems to be slowing down, he prays in his heart to hit, while looking at the giant evil beast at a glance, until the breath is regained The other party is still safe and sound, still running forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the interest rate, a snow column was raised far from the monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail is so swelled, because the behemoth is not going toward the sixth wall, resulting in an angle with the artillery, the long tube must Constantly adjust the angle, but also have to estimate the speed of the opponent's movement, shooting in advance, otherwise it will be like this, after the fire, the shells will be behind the target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the speed of the field guns, they only have one last chance before the monsters break through the wall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nails can already see the thick fur of the enemy and the bloody mouth under the fangs. The witches are coming here, obviously intending to intercept this. Head monster. But the four of them are not as good as one leg of the other, can it be done by magic alone? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in a hurry and even wanted to run to the sixth section of the city wall, reminding the artillery team to aim forward, but the warlord standing on each side of each wall made him finally pressure Lived this impulse - now away from the garrison position, it is likely to be seen as a escape. Iron Axe has repeatedly stressed that this kind of behavior that may cause the defense line to be scattered is absolutely forbidden. Once found, the supervising team can shoot and shoot directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil beast that ran in the front has entered the shooting range of the revolver rifle, and the city’s head rang a series of screaming sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail has to continue to perform its own task, placing a loaded loader next to the shooter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, the second roar of the earth-shattering sounded again, which was only three or four minutes away from the previous fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So...fast! ? The nail was surprised to look at the sixth section of the city wall. The smoke above the barrel had not dissipated, and there was still smoke left from the muzzle, like a ignited silver pipe. But even more shocking is still behind, he didn't even have time to observe whether the shooting hit the enemy, and the dazzling fire would appear again-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;third Sub-bombardment! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, don’t they need to load ammunition? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only saw four or five people busy behind the barrel, but no one had ever approached the muzzle, it seemed that the gun and those short The field guns are completely different, but they are like a runner rifle, which can be fired continuously! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attack has worked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail did not see the shells into the monster body, the first thing that caught the eye was a bloody fog that exploded on the side of the giant evil beast. In addition to the black blood, there are shredded fur and large pieces of flesh. At the same time, the evil beast trembled, and the whole body seemed to have smashed a few points. The solid fur was like a ripple on the surface of the water - but he wondered if it was an illusion, because the next moment, the hollow body It has returned to normal, but the eyes of the monster are squeezed out in the depression, and the black and white sticky objects are also ejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no roar of roaring death, and the behemoth falls straight to the ground and makes a dull percussion. Until then, the nail found the place where the shell hit - its body near the neck broke a big hole, although it was insignificant compared to the burly body, it is even difficult to link this hole with the fatal blow just now. together. A smoky green smoke is emerging from the cave, and the surrounding fur is burnt to black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hell monster is dead like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nails couldn’t hold back the excitement of the heart, and the previous fears were turned into snoring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if such a horrible and ferocious enemy can’t stop it The powerful weapon invented by His Royal Highness! In addition to the new artillery, he couldn't even think of other ways to kill this burly mixed kind of evil beast - even if the witch could do it, it wouldn't be so clean. Further thinking, in a sense, His Royal Highness has given them the supreme power to marry a beautiful witch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
