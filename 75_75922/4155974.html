			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you still alive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of a masked voice in the mind of silence - - That is the echo of consciousness that came from the birth tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It bowed its head and stared at the slightly faint white robes in his palm. "I said, I will not die until I destroy humans." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, but don't forget, deciding that this outcome is my Nasopelle! There is no union of a new symbiosis and a god of God. Strike, even if you fill in two or three thousand original bodies, it will play no role in this rugged mountain..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't deny this." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Probably did not expect it to be so simple, there was a brief pause there. "In short, if the king asked about the Western Front, I hope you remember what you said. In addition, Heckzod has nothing to do with this war. This is what you see with your own eyes. Although it has its reasons, it is better to distinguish it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The other party was a little dumb. "I didn't expect you to be quite understand Well, then go to the place where the bugs set up the fire and rain, I will let the god of God make you meet with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to recycle them by the way." "Weapons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Nasopelle said with pride. "That is both a proof of victory and a great collection for my search for mystery." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When climbing the mountain top along Panshan Road, the god of God has made Close the gate and it is slowly falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence has to admit that the Masked Maharaja does have its irreplaceable place - standing below the floating continent that is wider than the desolate mountains. There will be an illusion that a mountain will be crushed. But in fact it will turn to a standstill at the moment of touching the ground, just like a thousand things stacked on an egg without smashing the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a very easy thing to do with transportation and dispatching troops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, even if God does not land, it can also be exchanged inside and outside through the suspended platform, and the vertical distance of nearly 100 meters is enough for the enemy to look And the sigh is far from being comparable to the moats of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that it is an impossible task to capture the god of God from the outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While waiting for the confluence, Silence suddenly heard a slight noise from the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This position has long been abandoned by humans, even if there are leftovers, the symbiosis should solve them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It followed the source of the sound and went to a collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be the hidden work dug up by the other party, but it collapsed in the impact of the active spear, making the underground dark passage into a cage, a subtle sound It is from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If nothing is done, no matter who is trapped below, there is only one dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the silence turned down and one hand opened the collapsed roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not clear why you’re doing it—perhaps with the idea of ​​getting more intelligence, or perhaps the interest of the Grey Fortress Infected with it, and in a short while, it cleared a hole for one person to pass through in the collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark passage is not long, just after turning two corners, the silence comes to an end, and the source of the sound is also seen - the end of the dark passage is a relatively A spacious darkroom with an oil lamp hanging from the door. Under the dim light, a human male sits against the wall and gasps very hard. There are many blood trails on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this person should be aware of the structure of the dark road. Even if he abandoned his feet, he would not be able to escape the hidden fortifications. In this case, why is he still struggling with this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately..." The male looked up at it and looked at it. "The last thing to come is the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak, you know - the news, otherwise, death is a kind - luxury." Silent and blunt, unlike Wakiris, it has been conscious since most of the time Fighting with the Tianhai world and being unfamiliar with the human language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the other person did not hear the question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was thinking before... If I waited for my teammates, if it was the devil... I can’t just sit still." He was weak. He smiled. "There is still some propellant medicine here. If you cooperate with the detonator, you can do the final responsibility. I just didn't expect it to be a big fish..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; probably can't ask for anything, silent faceless expression, or give him to the mask to deal with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as it was preparing to stun the other side, a hemp rope slipped from the human hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the other end of the rope is like connecting the heavy objects, and then quickly slamming up after losing the bondage - the silence was discovered at this time, there are many cakes in the corner of the darkroom The thing, a black lacquered thing, fell silently from the low roof, and there was an iron box underneath, where the blood was the most dense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No...the other side’s struggle is not to escape this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil lamp hanging on the door frame will allow him to see the person in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rope in your hand guarantees that this arrangement can be triggered whether he loses consciousness or is killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——He dragged his broken body and climbed up and down in this small room, just for an opportunity not to sit still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence is going backwards at the fastest speed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The male raised his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Human... Long live!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extremely dazzling light emerges from the corner, In an instant, the darkroom will shine like white! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a loud bang, the collapsed position swelled up, like a giant punch from the inside, with a lot of gravel and product. The snow flew up the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on here?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The false face looked at the silent monarch who was carried to the god of God, and frowned at the assistant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unclear, I only know that there was another explosion in the hill... probably the trap of the bugs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nasperelle snorted. "It’s really awkward. If you change to other Maharaja, I’m afraid I’m already out of breath.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence at this time is just like being stepped on by the "corner". The broken armor has been mixed with flesh and blood. The face that looks like a human female has only a fuzzy outline, and the magic is left. Few. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't mean, is your idea correct?" The assistant bowed his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Nasopelle laughed. "Even if you have a strong body, the limit is no different. On the contrary, the symbiosis is the ideal evolutionary direction." ——Replace at any time after damage, there is no limit to growth, that is the body that I should pursue!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It no longer looks at the unconscious monarch, turns around Going to the tower of birth, " throw this guy into the Dianchi Lake and soak it, and you shouldn’t need it for a while. The worms must not think that the handy thing of the wolf heart is not the chief of the god of God. Goal, swallowing all kingdoms in one go is the fastest way to get the pieces."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
