			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is... how to do it?" Thunder opened his mouth in disbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are dozens of small holes in the wall, and each hole has a stone that emits pure white light. More than that, even the top edge of the ceiling is placed. A circle of this strange illuminating stone, under the soft light, every detail of the hall is at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time the ash saw the explorer revealing such an expression, he could not help but raise a joy. "You don't know? The witch injects power into the magic stone." After that, it can motivate additional abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what? Is it a magic stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder carefully took out a piece of luminous stone in his hand, and after leaving the hole, its light did not weaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Tilly shook her head. "These stones may have been here for hundreds of years - if the ruins are so long." Historical words. They were all hidden behind the slate, so they have not been discovered, and only the witch can do this to open this special institution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Don't you let them shine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, they can shine on their own," Tilly grabbed a piece of magic stone and lifted it to her eyes. The light illuminates her beautiful face. "If this is a device that needs magic to maintain, then it can't be taken down so easily, just like a candle can't easily leave the candle. At the moment, the wall There is nothing special about the hole except for the placement of luminescent stones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you really say it, it can shine on its own, and it can continue to shine. For hundreds of years, the value is simply incalculable," Thunder said. "You must know forever." The snow crystal produced by the kingdom can sell hundreds of golden dragons in a fist-sized piece, and its brightness is less than half of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors heard this Amazing prices, the eyes that look at those stones suddenly changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As we said before, you can take half of it," Tilly said, but her focus is not here. With plenty of light, she can explore this hall more carefully. The ashes couldn't bear to see her tearing the seaweed, and simply picked up the big sword. Like the mowing, the plants attached to the wall were swept down. Soon, the second magic stone hidden in the wall was also found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly injects magic into the same way. Accompanied by the crisp metal crash, everyone was surprised to see that a huge slate above Tiry's head was tilted down, with a number of tight copper ropes on both sides, and the inside was actually a well-cut ladder. Finally, one end of the slate slowly fell to the ground, and the other end led to the top of the ceiling. The ashes looked up and saw a horizontal metal door at the end of the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tilly," seeing the five kings and one person without hesitation on the stone ladder, the ashes could not help but open the door, "Let me come first." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, this is not what... the treasure land," she climbed to the top of the stone ladder, holding a raised magic stone next to the door, metal The door quickly opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Tily got into the door and disappeared into the ceiling, there was no other way to do the ash, so he kept up and held the giant sword in his hand. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash can't help but widen the eyes through the top plate. I saw that there is a room on the ceiling that is much smaller than the hall. The wall is also embedded with illuminating stones. - What surprised her even more is that there are almost no traces of water soaking here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wood tables, chairs, bookshelves, cabinets... everything is intact, covered with thick dust and even broken webs . A row of books was placed neatly on the bookshelf, all of which were grayed out by dust. On the table, in addition to the books that were spread out, there were cups, kettles, and pen holders. There was only a single pole left in the quill, and the ink had dried up. It is like two worlds compared to the hall full of algae and shells below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder climbed up the third time and looked around and took a sigh of relief. "Here is..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abandoned home," Tilly took the book on the table and gently patted the dust on it, flipping it through the page. "Someone has lived here for a long time. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I don’t understand,” she shook her head and spread the book out to the two. “It’s all words that I have never seen before.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to be the same," Ashes wiped the dust off the spine with his fingers, and the words were like strange wavy lines, which couldn't be read at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can take it back and study it slowly," Tilly laughed. "According to the agreement, books and magic stones are owned by me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Thunder touched the beard. "But when you find something, I hope to share this old story with me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people on the second floor I searched the room carefully and quickly touched the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn’t find a new magic stone, but instead found a strange thing on the other side of the room - it looked like a stubborn The metal tube has one end that is not in the stone wall, and the other end is reduced by section, and finally only the thickness of the wrist is left, and a glass lens is embedded at the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" The ashes knocked on the body and sent a series of crisp echoes inside - apparently the hollow tube was hollow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a bit like a gaze mirror, maybe people who live here use it to observe the outside world," Thunder looked at his eyes and looked at the lens. For a while, "black is a thing... nothing can be seen, it should be broken."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily," Tilly pointed to the back of the metal tube The wall, "Look here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes looked in the direction of her fingers, only to see a copper plate with a handle embedded in the wall, leaving under the handle There is a small hole that seems to be the place for the key to be inserted. The five kings walked over and tried to pull the handle, and the copper plate did not move. "It was locked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am coming," Ashes hold the handle and pull hard The whole copper plate suddenly fell off the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, it seems that you are right," Thunder applauded. "It is another magic stone institution."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge magic stone stuck in the groove behind the copper plate, unlike the first two, its volume looks much larger and the color is also purple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to activate it?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Tilly nodded without hesitation, holding the stone in her hands, but this time I didn't see the movement for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It...too big," her forehead There has been a sweat on the surface. "I feel that it is constantly drawing on the magic power. It seems that the mechanism behind it is very large."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you forget it," Ashes frown. She knows that once the magic is exhausted, the witch is likely to fall into a coma directly. It is obviously not a good choice to spend all the magic in such a dangerous place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s getting better, I can feel it." Tilly’s voice did not fall, a huge sound came from the wall, like a continuous Constant thunder, then the whole room vibrates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...the earthquake?" Thunder held the metal tube in case it fell, and the ashes caught Tily for the first time and held her In the arms. The dust slammed down and the three couldn't help but cough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vibration lasted for almost a quarter of an hour before it gradually returned to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly poked his head out of the stairs. "What happened just now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "A new institution," whispered, "Is it okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone was frightened, and there were several roofs that fell. Fortunately, I covered them with magical servants." The little girl walked to the side, "What are you looking at?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
