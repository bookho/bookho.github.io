			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the outbreak of the Western Front, the idea of ​​the Lord of Heaven has changed dramatically before the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its past understanding of human beings basically comes from various war reports and holy meetings, except for those worms that have obvious meanings of contempt, human beings lack enough soldiers. The type of awakened is basically the consensus of all Maharaja. Their promotion difficulty is comparable to that of the tribes, but their ability cannot be predetermined. This makes the overall strength of human beings extremely unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for those who are not magical, they are purely on the battlefield, equivalent to inferior bodies in the group. The latter was completely abandoned after the first war of gods, and even the qualifications for participating in the war were not available. At most, it can only be used as a hard work. From this point, we can also see the huge power gap between the two communities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Tianhai world has evolved more thoroughly, whether it is the sea boat that devours the mainland or the most basic warrior, has a highly similar magic, it is like It was designed specifically for war. Even the evil beasts that are eroded and controlled by them will grow into a demon body, which is undoubtedly the strongest of the four races. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, after the end of the second battle of God, the fragments of human inheritance have been regarded by the high-level as a bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Erskuk’s last words caused an uproar in the dominion of the Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, Heckzod has become more and more aware that it may not be exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the humans’ use of the flames beyond their expectations is not enough to cause the king’s vigilance, the enemy’s new weapon discovered two weeks ago is completely another It’s going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human males - this kind of individual who is seen as a singer, with the help of a witch, flies by a strange iron bird sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reaction to this news was never possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since ancient times, apart from the birds and beasts, the sky has always been the domain dominated by the demon, plus the saying that the gods come from outside the sky, even the top of the sky A layer of sacred meaning. How can the races that have no magical powers involve this holy field! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the witnesses have more than one person, and Haekzold, who has finally accepted this point, realizes that the promotion of human beings may not only be related to fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s already beginning to gradually become more and more vocal in the slogan of the screaming “supplement” – I’m afraid the nightmare is aware of this possibility earlier than it. Will be determined to enter the depths of consciousness to explore the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, humans have evolved at a speed that is too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that there is no news about Iron Bird in the report of Ursuk, if they had this weapon at the time, there is no reason to hide it. It is only used now. The only explanation is that in less than a year, human changes have moved from the ground to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a huge mutation can only be explained by the promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the male can also become the main force of the war, the human war potential will undoubtedly increase substantially, which may also be the true meaning of the last message in Erskuk Warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, compared to the flame, Heckzod is much more familiar with the sky, and the iron bird created by the other side is not much stronger than the fearful beast, as long as it has it. Here, the sky will not allow the rest of the people to get involved! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This offense will certainly not suffer the same defeat as the last time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This confidence is by no means a contempt - at this level, it is undoubtedly a foolish thing to despise the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its confidence comes from its own name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is the master of the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——After crossing the door, the Lord of Scorpio has appeared on the edge of the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
