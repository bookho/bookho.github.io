			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when Roland personally operated, he realized that the actual situation was far from being as simple as he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working in the backyard for four or five days, the higher hardness of the drill bit was made smoothly, using Anna's high temperature flame, he can easily get more than 1500 degrees Hot metal. Without the restriction of temperature, the conventional method of frying steel can quickly and easily produce small batches of steel – that is, rapidly stir the molten iron with iron rods, so that excess carbon and other impurities in the pig iron are fully contacted with the air for oxidation, and the molten iron is repeated several times. Cool down to get high quality steel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is on the steamer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prototype worked with great noise and vibration, and even the drill bit could not stably drill a complete iron pipe. This level of tremor does not matter when doing heavy work, but it is obviously not feasible to machine the barrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve this, he has to first create a centrifugal governor to control the output of the steam engine, then use the gear combination to reduce the chatter and adjust the rotation of the drill. rate. The processing of gears requires a simple lathe. In this way, Roland found that he could not achieve this goal before the coming of the demon moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, it is only possible to use the old method to knock out a hammer by the hands of the blacksmith. The plan to mass-produce firearms went bankrupt. According to the number of blacksmith shops in Bianbu Town, 3-4 barrels were produced at most in one month, which was still the case when the second steam engine was stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only good news is that you don't have to worry about the pass rate of the barrel. The blacksmith only knocked out the roughly round pipe, and then Anna unified the joint. The effect was close to the seamless pipe cut by the boring tool, which basically eliminated the risk of the blast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland had no choice but to modify his previous plan. He originally planned to recruit hunters from Bianbu Town to form a firearms team - most of them are proficient in archery, regardless of Whether it is a bow or a bow, they are all handy weapons. The addition of firearms training is short-lived, allowing them to quickly become combative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can now create up to four rifle guns in the Demon Moon, so you can only select the most outstanding hunters to build an elite team. It is. Roland decided to hand it over to the Iron Axe. He spent 15 years in Bianbu Town and was recognized as the best hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Brian has not been happy this half a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when you meet the militia team on the street, the feeling of unhappiness will double up... even the bottom of the heart is still unwilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt that he was forgotten by His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was excited when he was called by the chief knight a month ago. It was a lucky and glorious thing to get in touch with the four princes and accept the inquiries from His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grew up in Bianbu Town, although he was born into a family of ordinary hunters, but he took up the position of patrol captain by his own ability. He knew that he couldn't rely on his family to become a knight. He could only wait for the opportunity to make a contribution and accept the canon of the superior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Highness’s inquiry made him feel that the opportunity came. It is obvious that the Four Princes Roland is not willing to give up his territory. He is trying to find a way to fight against evil beasts. Later, the wall built by Daxie also proved a little. There is no doubt that this year they will spend the month of the demon in Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to stop the invasion of evil beasts here, you must form a team that dares to fight in front. Brian thought he was a man of choice. He was proficient in investigation, swordsmanship and riding. He stayed until the last ignited bonfire to prove that he did not lack courage, but he never expected that His Royal Highness would like to select a team from the civilians. Fight the evil spirits! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a pure civilian team, not just him, none of the entire patrol team was approved by the chief knight. This is simply incredible. Is it true that the group of people who have never held a sword will be better at fighting than they are? I am afraid that when I see the fierce appearance of the evil beasts, they will collapse into the army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But His Highness seems to be serious... He is not only training this group of people, but also giving them a uniform costume. Every afternoon, Brian can see the group wearing brown and gray leather, arranged in two columns to run through the street. At the beginning, the team was still sparse, and it has become more and more neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he turned over and over in the evening, there was a sound coming from the next door, and then the door was pushed open, and someone quietly walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, get up," the whispered. Brian heard the voice of the other party, a member of the patrol team, nicknamed the fierce guy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was sleeping five people in his room, except for himself and the Greyhound, the other three quickly turned up, just like they had already prepared, even the coat Did not take off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, get up, I have something important to tell you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fierce in the long song fortress has a noble relative, I heard that it is still a big aristocrat, so his position in the team is very high, Brian does not ignore him, had to climb up and ask, "What?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Greyhound was also woken up. "This...so late, you...you don't sleep...Is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a good introduction to you, do you want to be a knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Knight? Gray dog ​​surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian’s heart is also a jump, and quickly asked, “What is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You all know my uncle, Hiller. He is the earl of the Duke's adult and the cronies of the adults. The news is that he personally confessed to me," the fierce voice whispered. "The four princes are ready to open the long song fortress alone. Dry, the Duke is very unhappy. He decided to let the prince know who is the owner of the West."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Difficult, difficult, not... you plan... ... stab, assassination..." The gray dog ​​was more stuttered when it was tense, and it was not complete for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it possible," said the fierce smile. "Whatever he is, he is also a prince. If he dies, even the Duke will not be able to shelter us. I said "This is a good job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright feels that the deal is definitely not as simple as he claimed, but the temptation of the booked knight is too great. He couldn't help but open his mouth. "Speak and listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Food. Without food, he can only roll back to the long song fortress. It was promised by the Duke, as long as we can successfully burn the food bought by the four princes, he will hold a book for us and give us a piece of land on the east side of the fortress. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, captain, what do you think? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, you are crazy..., the temple, Your Highness is not saying, this year... The Year of the Demon is likely to hold... for more than four months." You burned the food and burned it, what do you eat!" The gray dog ​​shook his head again and again. "Two... two years ago, big Everyone forgot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it about us?" Another person disdain, "I didn't intend to stay here anyway, I will do what Ryan is doing." Now, we can live comfortably in the fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, do you still want to eat slag for a lifetime in this ghost place?" Also help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, they have long been colluded, and Brete’s heart is cold. Except for himself and the Greyhound who grew up in Bianbu Town, they are mostly from all over the Kingdom. There is no nostalgia for the town. Seeing that he couldn't stop it, he had to shift the subject. "But those wheats have been transferred to the castle under the prince's prince. There are guards under the guard at the door, how can you get in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I have to call you," said the fiercely smirk. "I have been in this broken place since I was a child. No one is more familiar with the environment than you. I remember As you said, there is an abandoned well in the back ravine that is connected to the water channel below the castle. Through it, you can go straight to the castle garden. When you were a child, you didn’t climb in. How about doing this with me? In one stroke, you can become a knight in the future - or the knight who was personally enshrined by the Duke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No...the knight should be brave and fight against injustice, should not Fear of power, protect the weak! For the personal grievances of the Duke’s adults, the town’s residents are ignored in the threat of hunger and death. In addition to an empty shell, such a knight has any glory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
