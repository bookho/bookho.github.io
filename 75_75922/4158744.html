			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South of the Fertile Plains, Tower No. 10. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possan is outside the turret and looks at the outline of the ancient city in the distance. She once saw the report of the Northern Expedition in the weekly newspaper. She knew that it was the famous witch city of Takira in history. The devil spent a thousand miles in order to seize it, but was eventually repelled by the First Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, they are going to beat new enemies here and recapture Takira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One minute...30 seconds...10 seconds...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is silent, Plug your ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Booming and banging--" behind him, the roar of the artillery sounded. The continuous tremor is transmitted to the body through the ground, and she can feel the slight numbness of her arms. That is the artillery's 152mm fortress gun that is pouring firepower at the target, which is completely out of one level compared to the short tube field gun on the tank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The leader, have you not adapted to the cannon?" The driver turned back and teased. He sat cross-legged in the front of the car and held a box of canned food in his hand. This is also the point she admire to each other - even if he is on the battlefield where the corpse is everywhere, and there is a scent of evil spirits everywhere, he can eat as usual. "This can't be done. You have to learn to let your ears filter out the unrelated murmurs yourself to stay focused."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I see you are just not too well Sensitive.” Possan looked away with a blank expression. Although the driver and the gunner were experienced veterans, according to regulations, the captain was the leader of the team. Moreover, judging from the actual age, maybe she is a little bigger than the two. "The only voice I need to listen carefully is the abnormal sound of the screaming magic stone - neither gunshots nor your nonsense, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The leader... You are really mean when you talk." Bellow licked his mouth. "I thought Miss Witch was sweet and lovely, like the Nanawa Angel..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The witch five years ago was the devil's minion, the evil incarnation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃--you will not People like it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whoever said, I think the team leader is very good." The gunner Shure interjected, "being straightforward, strong ability, from Without the experience of joining the army, but able to adapt to the battlefield in a short time, it is completely the choice of the captain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are looking forward to Shure . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter groaned, "Why, what am I saying wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No," Poshan shrugged. "Although you tried to shoot ten shots and nine airs during training, you are not without anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunner reveals the expression of enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have done it, or don't say this." Bell quickly transferred the topic. "To the team leader, before the tower number nine station, that guard Who is waiting for you outside the camp? He seems to be wearing the first uniform, is it your friend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you ask this?" <<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty is a little embarrassed, "I saw him hanging a medal on his chest, so I want to know it - it’s not easy to get a honour, he should It’s a very good guy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I did know, but he’s not that great, and without my words it’s estimated to have become a food for the evil beast.” Poshan Putting out a look that doesn't care, the tone can't help but slow down a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, you are too strict..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for the other party to finish, She covered her ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A round of deafening shelling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unprepared shells were slammed by the roaring roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that your attention is not so concentrated." Poshan patted the side steel plate of the turret, "Twelveth car group, immediately set off!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bay did not return the mouth, but dropped the cans in his hand and slid into the car from the driving window. Shure also retracted into the narrow turret and prepared for the battle - no matter what the usual time, at the crucial moment, the two were still unambiguous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possan raised the gazebo and saw that under the attack of the artillery units, many evil beasts had ran out of the ruins and fled to the north. Looking back, the first army soldiers were divided into dozens of squads, and the ruts of the tanks were steadily advancing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This battle is obviously not used to deal with ordinary mixed species. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deeper the plain, the more the number of blade beasts they encounter - from the first two or three days, to the present day. Because it is difficult to detect by the naked eye, it is far more difficult to deal with than the general evil beast. There is no doubt that the military's upper-level strategy is effective. "Scream-Resonance" can find targets outside the short-barrel's range and then annihilate them, but the enemy does not seem to be a mere beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will hide behind various shelters and launch a sudden attack on the army. The fire of the cannons will scare off the evil beasts, but they will not be able to take them away, so they will recapture them. The fortresses along the railways have spent a lot of effort. After paying a certain price, the First Army quickly established a set of tactics centered on armored units. The original Gunsmen only used tanks as investigators, but now they have learned to rely on them to clean up their fortifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruins of Tacila in front of you are by far the most complex non-field battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the 12th car group, one of the pioneers, entered the city of Takira, and next to Bossan was the 9th and The 17th car group. According to the plan, they will be responsible for cleaning up the area leading to the West Square in the main street and reclaiming the two fortresses set up here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the surrounding scene, Poshan couldn’t help but feel numbness in the scalp. Many stone buildings make the situation in the city extremely complicated, and the scope of investigation of screaming marks is large. Discounted - she has now monitored multiple sources of magic, but she has never been able to target specific targets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you get here before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple, just kill the red The fog tower and the bone shelves, the devil will naturally retreat." Shure replied, "Have you found the enemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not yet. But sure There are a lot of monsters in the city.” Poshan said that the soldiers behind him were more gestures, getting them closer to the tank and lengthening the distance from the other two groups. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, a gray concrete fortress appeared at the end of the street - although the First Army was forced to give up this place, these solid fortifications were not The destruction of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a scream is noticeably getting bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bossan frowned, it was not the sound of the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at the captain of the 9th car, Amy, who shook her head to show the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When driving past the fortress, the screams of the seals were so large that they could be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of caution, she temporarily stopped the two cars and decided to go to the square to see it first, and by the way activated the resonance of the hand. Even if the target is not a beast, she wants to know where this magic source is pointing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, a fluorescent light appeared out of the air, pointing straight to the center of the square not far away - and there was nothing at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did she encounter a new invisible enemy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Poshan soon discovered that the stone bricks on the surface of the square seemed to be smashed by something, surrounded by black corrosion marks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing is hidden under the ground! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts just arrived, the mud under the stone bricks suddenly arched up - a monster consisting of flesh and ribs crawled out of the ground and spit out A bunch of "transparent body"! If it weren't for those things that were still covered with some mucus, Posnan couldn't separate them from the background. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
