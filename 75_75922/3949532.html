			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland walked to the center of the garden and couldn’t help but see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small room made of plants at the end of the passage. The trunk and the improved crops formed the walls, and a series of criss-crossing vines hung overhead. It is like being carefully woven, and a few bunches of crystal grapes are hanging from the green leaves. There was a pot of bonfire burning in the middle of the house, surrounded by lush green furniture - if you look closely, they are made of strange plants that are elongated from the ground. For a moment, he thought that he had come to the world of fairy tales. If he was not standing by the bonfire, he would have several familiar figures. He really doubted that this was a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly turned back and showed a sighful look "The ability of the leaves has evolved, and she has turned this garden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about her?" Roland was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has been integrated into the plant," Tilly looked around. "The sights you see in front of you are all part of the leaves."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before feeling that walking in a huge creature is not an illusion, but the "great creature" is replaced by a leaf, and Roland suddenly becomes tight. "She won't be able to recover." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As soon as I disarm, I can return to normal," the voice of the leaves suddenly rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But listen carefully, this is not her own speech, but the words of the rustling sound of the leaves shaking, the friction of the branches and the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party’s answer gave Roland a little relief. “Can you hear us?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Not only can you hear, but you can see, smell, touch," the leaves look very pleasant. "I can feel any change in the garden, including the birds setting up a nest on the branches, and the bugs crawling on the trunk." Move... This feeling is hard to describe in words. Tilly is right. I am now the garden itself. From the moment you walked in, I noticed you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking, a huge leaf rolled up from the ceiling to Roland's hand, slowly spread, only inside it with a cup of purple-red liquid. The cup is made up of four olive leaves, and the petiole forms the ear of the cup, which looks small and exquisite. Roland took the cup and put it on his mouth and found that it was a new wine, with a refreshing sweetness in the slightly sour. It seems that both the wine and the container come from this garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland drank the other party’s “toasting” and walked to the campfire, sitting on the plant bench with great interest – its support was rough branches, chairs The face and back are covered with a thick layer of wheat leaf, which sits like a sofa. There is a barbecue on the side of the campfire, and Andrea is baking apples and corn for everyone. Undoubtedly, these are also taken from the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you do it?" the prince looked up and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know the process very well," the voice replied quickly. "I just take care of the new crops and your flight messenger as usual, incidentally. Practice your abilities - and then they respond to my call. This may be the path I've been looking for, turning the jungle and its life into a true whole."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are able to use it in a hidden forest? Can you turn it into a part of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think... No," she hesitated for a moment. "Even if it can, it will take a long time. It doesn't take much magic to maintain this state. Even the woods can supplement it for me, but every time I expand the control range, It will make me feel slow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slow thinking?" Roland groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know how to describe this feeling," said the leaf. "If you slowly expand the scope of control, after a few years, I should be able to hide Forests are integrated into one, but if I get into it instantly, I am afraid I will lose my mind. When I first merged with the garden, I felt that my head was not enough. It seemed that my mind suddenly became very empty, and it took a long time to return to normal." She paused and added, "But the plants that have been controlled have no such sense of alienation when they enter again. They can be realized with a single turn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
