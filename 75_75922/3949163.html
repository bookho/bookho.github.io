			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a shed in the back garden of the castle, surrounded by wooden boards, leaving only two holes to make windows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the shed is a square block of blue bricks, about three meters long and wide, filled with loess. After adding water in an appropriate amount, it is not only difficult to burn, but also has a certain degree of plasticity. With a small shovel, the ideal shape can be dug. There are also a few iron ingots piled up on the loess - this is Carter Lannes dragged from the blacksmith shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a well at the edge of the pool. Roland took this point and asked people to put the shed here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as a laboratory, it’s still too rudimentary. He shook his head, and it was natural to say something that was pieced together in one night. The official workshop will not be able to select the site for construction until Barov has collected the information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Did you sleep well yesterday?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and looked Anna, with a look of sorrow, asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch’s current appearance is the same as that in prison. After careful cleaning, her linen shawl has a long, supple and shiny skin. Although not maintained, but the young, the light freckles at the bridge of the nose adds a youthful vitality. Her figure is still thin, her slender body seems to be pushed down, but her cheeks have a rosy color, and the bruises and marks on the neck are much lighter than yesterday. Roland suspects that the magic has improved the physical qualities of the witch in addition to the magical power of the witch. At least in terms of resilience, Anna is much faster than the average person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have experienced so many terrible things, I should let you rest for a few more days, but the time is very urgent, so I have to wait for you to compensate you later." Roland turned around the girl. "Is this dress still fit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clothes that Anna is wearing now are exactly what he has carefully selected from a variety of programs. - to satisfy his bad taste. The overall protective clothing of the ironsmith is too thick and is not suitable for her. Although the wizard's robe in the game looks tall, the action is everywhere, and the fully enclosed robe is easily stained with Mars and turned into ashes. As for the maid costume, hey, is there more suitable than this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if there is no real maid costume in the world, it is not a big problem. The maid's overalls already have the prototype of the future maids. So Roland directly asked Tyre to cut his suit according to Anna's body shape, shortening the skirt, changing the long sleeve to short sleeves, turning the round neck into a collar, and then putting on a bow. The new witch uniform was released. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a pointed top witch hat (custom), black boots (off the shelf), and a short knee cloak (custom), one can only be used in the past The characters seen in the movie stood so freely in front of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, you...what do I need to do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna is really unable to keep up The idea of ​​this big man, she feels that she is losing her ability to think. When she was dragged into the bag in the dungeon, she thought that the cursed life would soon be liberated. But after taking off his hood, Anna found that she was not seeing a gallows or a guillotine, but a magnificent house. Then a bunch of people came in and undressed and bathed her. From the squat to the toe seam, no one is not cleaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a dressing, she didn’t expect anyone to dress in the clothes, but I didn’t expect the clothes to be so comfortable—they were softly attached to the body and felt Less than a trace of friction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one came in, the old man with a white beard, and he ordered everyone to retreat and put a contract in front of her. At this moment, she realized that it was actually the king of the four kings who was employed in prison, and the words of hiring were not jokes. The contract clearly stated that if she works for the prince, she will have a reward for the Golden Dragon every month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annacle knows what a golden dragon means. His father works in the mine all day long. He decides the salary according to the amount of minerals. The best time is. A silver wolf. And a hundred silver wolves can be exchanged for a golden dragon, which depends on whether the silver wolf is full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what is her job, sleeping with the prince? When she took a bath, Anna did listen to the maiden whispers, but she didn't think she was worth the price. The blood eroded by the devil, the unclean who has fallen from the sin... Anyone who knows her true identity will only avoid it, even if the prince’s curiosity is strong enough, even the devil is not afraid, and there is no need to pay her any Remuneration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
