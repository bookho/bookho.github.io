			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing Roland already knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the gods are no longer the only way to fight against the devil, some people hold the belief that they are not willing to use the same kind of material as the shell material and Akaris A serious conflict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the battle of faith recorded in the history books of the church is probably the name of this battle of faith - using a fictional victory to cover up the facts The truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root cause of this conflict, apart from the inconsistency, is a bit of a surprise: the high-level leaders of the Federation know that no matter which option they choose, There is no guarantee that the devil will be defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Felice, the Queen’s God’s Prisoner’s Sleeping Program does allow the Federation to have between 3,000 and 4,000 before the Battle of God. An extraordinary warrior with endless strength and mature skills and tactics. But the disadvantage is that once these thousands of people lose, they can't be effectively supplemented in a short time. It is a long process for the soul to adapt to the body. A group of warriors who cannot withstand consumption may be able to stop the devil's attack for decades. It is not realistic to even recapture the ruined city of Tacchira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the winners plan, not to mention, is completely gambling luck. Failure is normal. Once successful, there are no side effects, and the slate paintings can make the witch closer to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the two, one is fighting now, one is betting on the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The end result is, have you defeated the Star City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The break will not produce real The winner, Takira is not the last winner. After the two sides lost the extraordinary, Eleanor stood up. In order to stop this internal friction, she devoted herself to the central carrier and became the first witch to be merged." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean, all three seats are in the maze ruins..." Ai Gesha was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the consortium has lost three supernaturals, and it means the complete disintegration of the three-seat system." Pasha said sadly, "such a The relics became part of the survivors' inability to give up. The two sides had to step back from each other and reached an agreement at the negotiating table. Takira stayed to continue to study the magic core, and the Star City went to Hull as planned. Metz built the new holy city; because the original carrier was extremely limited, in order to ensure that we have enough manpower, they will provide a certain bodyless shell to the maze remains, this period is one hundred years."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the deadline, if there is no breakthrough discovery, or if the clues of the chosen person are still not found, they will take back all the research results of the relic, including the instruments and original carriers that contain the soul. At the time, the Star City will come with the gods, and if we violate the agreement, they will never be merciless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait..." Roland I heard something wrong, "The church has been Have you ever been to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the results, the Tachila witch is still hiding in the ground, and has not turned over to gain a dominant position, and the gods used by the church The military has always been a disintegrated version without consciousness. It has an overwhelming advantage in terms of quantity, but it has not sent troops to capture the remains of the maze... It is difficult, they have forgotten this agreement? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pasha sighed, "For a long time, we did not have the ability to explore outwards - the original carrier could not be exposed to the sun, and The witch who transferred the soul needed to re-adapt to the body, so it was not clear what Hermes had at the time... It was later discovered that the new order they constructed no longer followed the will of Akaris."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure!" Ai Gesha gnawed her teeth. "I said that the adult can't do this. The church's practice is completely destroying it. The foundation of the witch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence caused the unanimous approval of the survivors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland and others waited for a little calm and then changed the subject and asked, "What is the central carrier? What is the difference between it and the original carrier?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They are all shells - the body of the obsolete civilization is very fragile, so it has to be parasitic in the shell. These shells have the ability to live forever, as to where Come, the literature does not describe in detail." This time the respondent seems to have changed one person. Compared with Pasha and the former angry person, her tone is very intellectual and feminine. "In the knowledge we have at present, the original carrier is The most common type of body. In addition to its similar shape, the central carrier also stores a lot of unconscious memory inside, which can be regarded as an original carrier that has been used all the year round but has lost consciousness. Only these memories can be merged. Together, we can interpret the legacy documents and test records."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
