			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mom...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland takes a deep breath and raises his hand to wipe the cheek, which feels too Really, let's go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows that he is just pretending to be easy to cover up the negative emotions in his heart. Until then, his hand was still shaking slightly, and the back was a bit wet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, he seems to have experienced a terrible disaster, even though it is only a short moment, but he is like a life with the disappearance He passed the final stage with civilization, or he himself was one of them. From fish worms to birds and beasts, from low to high, their struggling figures and painful sounds are lingering, as the entire universe has become dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tear is flowing for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Roland even had some reluctance to leave the sun coming in from the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window that was originally unremarkable has become particularly moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is a sewage flowing through the wall, and the dog skin advertisements everywhere, it is vivid and natural. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the messy and busy streets for a long time, he barely calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he is basically certain of one thing - magic does not exist in this world from the beginning. This speculation was proposed by Anna in the second act, and it was confirmed at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the "gate plan" that led to the emergence of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no doubt, that is not the result that the interlocutor wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gray Shadow" is looking forward to getting rid of gravity, and the other party is more straightforward to mention "unpredictable risks."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the magic is an accident they didn't anticipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical havoc caused by the gods became the so-called "cost" of the gods, and ultimately this power spread in a very short period of time, the interlocutors did not Can escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole world has also become what he sees now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland found that even if he understood this, what he knew was only a little fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most critical question is, what is the "gate plan", and why does "gray" not forget this? What is the relationship between the war of gods and all this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t expect them to fill in this loophole? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and stared at the courier box for a while, and finally picked up the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Rock, I need the association to help me find someone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No winter city, fertile plain entrance, station 2. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A train slowly stops in front of the loading dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Man, let me take a step first." Chuck rushed to the platform without waiting for the front of the car to be completely still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you guy, boiler loading can't always let me alone -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Please, please! I will ask for the ale at night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ran to the freight car and left Hank’s voice behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the Battle of Tacilla, Chalm did not become a mighty and handsome officer as he expected - although including the father and the elder brother of sacrifice Within the family, all four of them received their awards and honours, but the Executive Office transferred him and his father to the queue of the First Army and became a full-time train driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the words of his father, it is not where he is for his Majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, the treatment is much higher than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham is not so happy, dealing with the dark coal all day, how to hold a long gun to fight the monsters. Moreover, the eldest brother sacrificed in the camp to defend the battle, he took a few devils on the front line to avenge the big brother, waiting for a steam train can not do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most what makes him worry is that the second brother has not been affected, not only successfully promoted, but also was selected into the elite of the first army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is too unfair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham originally thought that in the next few years, he would spend his time in this desolate wilderness. I didn’t expect that the development of the matter completely exceeded him. The expectation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of residential areas and farms have sprung up in the north of the desolate mountains, the number of sites has grown linearly, pubs and shops have followed, and the delivery of goods is no longer A boring job, ending early, he can go to the restaurant to drink a few cups a day. The train driver is undoubtedly a popular occupation for the audience. Whether it is a local or a migrant, everyone is interested in the restricted area that has been passed down as a "cursed land". It is so exciting that there is no need for a refill. Save yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this kind of treatment is similar in the absence of winter city or other sites. What really makes him look forward to is the people here-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please arrange a team and receive your own dolls in an orderly manner!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl next to the truck box Shouted with both hands on his lips. Not waiting for him to come, the other party has already seen him, happy to wave his hand, "You are coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the cute smile, check It feels great to be a train driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am here to help." He picked up his sleeves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, then you also take a person on your body." The girl smiled and handed over a straw-studded doll, hanging it on her feet. On his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, nothing to be diligent." And another woman jumped from the pile and gave him a cold look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham returned without retreating, and the two men blinked at the moment and stalemate in the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the girl interrupted the confrontation between the two parties. "Okay, Poshan, Mr. Chalm is just warm-hearted. When we lost our way, it was not thanks to him." Help?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you get lost, the woman’s face suddenly becomes stiff, and she starts with a disdainful sigh. “I’m too lazy to care about you today, let go, I have to work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, she grabbed two bags of seeds and walked back to the yard without heading back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry..." The girl was embarrassed to be slightly stunned, "Boshan she is just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, I don't mind." Cham pretended to be a generous hand, then carried the seeds and followed them up. In fact, he expects that the day has been going on for a long time, and the manuscripts have been played countless times. There is a new drama in the winter without a winter theater. He has already set two Tickets, just wait until the work is done early, and then open an invitation to the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two women are witches who sleep in the curse - their acquaintance is very dramatic, the first time the girl took the train to the second site to assist in construction I accidentally sat over my head. Looking at an empty plain, she was at a loss and was crying with pears and rain. And Poshan, who was with her, didn't have a good place to go, facing a strange environment that was so greedy, showing a highly alert, shocking and fearful look, like a cat who had been stepped on the tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Chalm had to stop the train, transfer the two to another returning train, and repeatedly smash their destination to the opposite driver. Let the two people arrive at Site 2 smoothly before dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
