			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the tail of Qiu Jin, no winter city ushered in a guest who has not seen for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businesswoman Margaret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this friend who first came to the door and brought a rewarding reward to the struggling Bianque Town, Roland gave a very high standard of courtesy, not only the first The army was welcome, and he personally went to the shoal and took her into the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are so kind, sire," Margaret said with a smile. "I am just an ordinary businessman."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without your help, it’s hard to get into the West today," Roland said easily. "No winter city will never live up to friendship."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it was the initial bulk purchase of food, or the subsequent loaning of many vessels to transport refugees, it was done with the help of the Margaret Chamber of Commerce. Even Tassa can stand firm in the old king, and can not do without the connections and support of Margaret. Although these are not provided free of charge, Roland is very clear that many things can be done without money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s my pleasure to be called a friend," Margaret said slightly. "This time in addition to fulfilling the previously signed perfume contract, I still Bringing you new business opportunities," she said, pointing to the "most prominent merchants in the fjord, full of interest in your steam sailing program."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Roland smiled. "I will trouble you for a good introduction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his practice, and Businessmen deal with each other while eating and talking. After entering the living room, the long table has been filled with all kinds of delicious food, and these overseas visitors seem to be particularly satisfied with not eating fish. Plus the fjord is not popular aristocratic etiquette, they also tried to control at first. Be yourself and be as elegant as possible. After a few glasses of wine, the atmosphere rose higher, and the rituals that were imitated were all left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland doesn't mind this at all, he prefers a lively dining environment compared to the cumbersome table rules in the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the chat, he also had a general understanding of the visiting business group. In addition to the two Moore and Marland, the first to visit the Bianyuwan merchants in Bianbu Town, as well as the Chamber of Commerce from the Sunset Island and Shallow Water City. The two islands, one south and one north, are next to the Crescent Bay, forming a close-knit business circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the first place to live in the fjords, the size of the three islands is small, the population and strength are the top in the fjord, and the competition between them is quite Intense, this can be seen from the scale of the other two fleets. Each boat docked at the port of Shoal is all three sea-going vessels, each capable of carrying nearly three hundred people, as well as equal weight goods - the price of such a sailboat is close to five thousand gold dragons, not including sailors . Obviously, in the battle for face and strength, the two chambers do not want to lag behind the Crescent Bay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dessert came up, it meant that the talks officially started. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to Margaret, do you want to buy a steam engine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes "Respected Majesty," Nie Long, the head of the Shallow Water City Chamber of Commerce, spoke first. "But it's not just the steam engine, the steam ship you sell to the Crescent Bay. We also hope to have it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that the renovation cost you have previously issued is 1,800 Golden Dragons? Sunset Island is willing to add another 200, and transform five ships at the price of two thousand Golden Dragons," Sunset Island Merchant Etienne is not far behind. "The Chamber of Commerce can pay half of the deposit first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously they are referring to the steam paddle boat purchased by Chin Moon Bay a year ago. For Roland, this is already a technology that is about to be eliminated. It is a very cost-effective deal to use this order to train workers and earn a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It takes two to three months to rebuild a paddle steamer, and five ships take about a year. If you can accept it, City Hall Director Barov I will sign this contract with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no problem at all, but there is a small request at Sunset Island." Etienne cleared his throat. "We hope that you can use the craftsmen of the fjord to complete the ship renovation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
