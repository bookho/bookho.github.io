			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting, the two official representatives specifically left Roland, pledge that the government will further promote more aid projects, including experimental data on the first generation of nuclear weapons are also considered Inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, letting them make such commitments is not simply a slogan of the martial arts associations, and those magical creations with magical effects are also so important for the government. the reason. In short, as the guardian meteor claimed, this meeting is only the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few days, the Grey Fort Design Bureau has made up all the defects left by Dongcheng City due to its own development. A project has hundreds or even thousands of people to think and perfect. The battle of God is no longer the fate of a world. Roland first felt deeply that the human beings who survived in the world are not alone. There is still one behind him. The power that cannot be ignored is supporting him. Although the two worlds have never had a real sense of contact, fate has closely linked them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this round of technological reforms, Roland’s Executive Office has increased the recruitment of workers and has planned more than a dozen new factories in one breath. Ma's new products from high-performance composite gunpowder to semi-automatic machine tools. After solving the constraints of population and economy, the winter city in the high-speed rising period can fully construct and develop itself according to his will. At least until the main contradiction of survival is moderated, this momentum will not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the occasion of the vigorous development of technological innovation, Roland suddenly received an unexpected and pleasant news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jon, who has been missing for nearly a year, is back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting the news, he and the nightingale immediately rushed to the No.1 First Medical Center - since the winter of last year, the government’s public education and medical scale has been expanded. The Executive Office has built three medical centers on the south bank of the Chishui River, the central section of the Kingdom Road and the Changge Fortress, responsible for the simple diagnosis and epidemic prevention work in each district. The Chengxi Hospital, which was first transformed from the aristocratic compound and known as the resident of Miss Nana, naturally got the name of the “first court”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the ward, Camilla Darry squinted at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty and Tilly have returned to the front line, the book is busy with the re-enactment of information, and the sleepy island butler has taken over the task of taking care of everyone. What's more, she has witnessed the disappearance of Joan, and her heart has always been guilty. Now, the joy she has recovered is even stronger than anyone else. This can be seen from her initiative to salute herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, she always thought that she had “robbed” Tilly, which was the main reason for the death of the ashes. If it was not for intelligence, the Tianhai community might directly threaten The fjord and the sleeping island, she will not move to live without winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not too much about Roland, swaying his hand, "How is her situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Can only say that... there is no serious problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only?" Roland did not understand. In his opinion, returning safely and without incident is already the best result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She...has returned to her previous appearance." Kamila touched Joan's hair and sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until after listening to her story, Roland finally understood what the other party meant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe is not traveling back to Shoal Harbor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first to discover her is a winter-free fisherman who lives on fishing. According to the man’s report, when he went to the sea to fish, the night was suddenly awakened by the impact of heavy objects coming from the stern, and then he heard the sound of food. Originally thought that it was a sea ghost, when I was planning a desperate fight, I did not expect to see a "big fish" similar to human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was holding a mammoth in the pot and was a mammoth, like a few days have not eaten anything. Seeing the panicked fishermen did not attack, but issued a few strange screams, and then shrunk in the corner of the deck, as if sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affected by the long-term propaganda of the Winter City, the fishermen sent it back to the Port of Shoal with a try-and-shoulder--a reward for saving a witch It is much higher than a boat, and it can only be a witch if it is not a sea ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lily has already checked her, there are many parasitic infections in the body, and some insects can't be eradicated by ability." Camilla said with a heartache. "In order to eliminate the hidden danger as soon as possible, I poured a sleeping fern into her sleeping child." Then, with a knife, the shelled worms embedded in the skin are pulled out. In theory, these bugs will only appear on older ships and whales."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"That is, Joan is not coming back from the Shadow Islands?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The distance will not be dyed," she shook her head "And at the speed of Joan, it’s not so long to return from the ruins to the Winter City. What I am worried about is... what terrible experience she experienced, which led to a change back to the past."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to clean up the parasites, get hungry on the boat to find food, fatigue and almost coma, all of which indicate that the journey is full of danger, long-term under excessive stress, witches It is very likely that there will be psychological trauma that cannot be repaired. McMug is a typical example. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camilla has the ability to communicate with the heart, not afraid that the other party will not speak. What she really worried about is that Joan can’t recover any more. Spend the rest of your life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can’t help but sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, it doesn't mean that the body doesn't mean everything, no matter whether it is Nana's medical bandage or Lily's purified water, it can't cure the psychological occlusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the rhythmic knocking of the door broke the silence in the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale turned back to open the door with some doubts, only to see the mysterious moon's head melon from the door after the seam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... I heard that Joan is back? Wait, feed, don't squeeze me-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The door was suddenly pushed open, and several people stumbled into the house. In addition to the mystery month, there were Axia, Xuelun and Amy. The last thing that went into the house was Lily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No way, she was discovered." Lily said helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough! First statement, I just heard that Joan is sick, only to visit her!" Mystery is firm, "She belongs to the expedition, But neither lightning nor wheat is in it, and only we can accompany her. It’s not the idea of ​​taking the opportunity to pull her into the detective group, not even---<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axia has reached out and grabbed her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is just her personal reverie, it has nothing to do with everyone." Xue Lun looked upright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, isn’t it better to have one more member?" Amy said with amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Lily made a snoring gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the guilty group of people, Roland couldn’t help but smile. He looked at Camilla Darry and shrugged his hand. The latter glimpsed a little, and then the expression relaxed a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe Joan did encounter something terrible, but with such a group of people, he believes that the other party can return to the original track sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what do you think is this?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks like a satin..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can there be satin in the hospital? Very high-grade."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or, ask Carmela to be a good one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...Why don't you ask?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't dare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard it. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Kamila was on the road. "That was the cloth that Joan used to tie the wound, because it was not all thrown away at the time. Be careful of the bacteria attached to it. I have said in my book, don't touch it. Source of infection?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
