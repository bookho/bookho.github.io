			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after the minister’s assistant left, the prince ushered in a long-lost good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guardian Shaun who went to Bishui Port to buy crop seeds returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland followed the letter to the guards and walked into the garden, seeing Sean and several other guards unloading a bag of bags from the back of the mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been almost a month since the day of departure. Today, he looks a lot tanned and his body is getting thinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the prince appeared, Sean immediately stood up and raised his hand. Roland stepped forward and patted him on the shoulder. "Good job. What seeds are brought back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn squats, Unwrapping the parcels on the ground, "Pearl rice, eggs, sugar bars... The plants you described, I bought them in the clear water port. It is true that most of them are produced in the country of the fjord, but there are already many farmland in the clear water port. These crops are out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have any questions about the planting method?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Q However, they can't say the specific method. They also said that if these plants leave the South, it is difficult to survive in other places.” Sean grabbed a yellow orange-orange granule from the parcel and spread it in front of Roland. Your Highness, this is the pearl rice. The merchant said that if I bought it together with the pearl stick, it would be cheaper. But the pearl stick is too heavy and it is not convenient to carry. I only bought one complete one, and the rest are stripped. Seed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that Pearl Rice is familiar to him.  corn. He excitedly picked up a corn kernel and looked it in the sun. The fruit is a bit dry and it seems to be stocking a winter stock. The yield of corn is naturally higher than that of wheat, and the low soil requirements, coupled with the transformation of the leaves, may soon replace wheat and become the main ration of Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn untied another parcel and took out a round brown crop. "This is an egg, I eat in a hotel in the clear water port." After that, cut into strips in the basin, chew very crisp, and have a faint sweetness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this familiar shape, Roland feels extremely. This is clearly a potato! He used his fingers to open the dirty skin, revealing the deep yellow potato inside—compared with the later generations. At this time, the potatoes were not big, the tubers were dark, and not every one grew like an egg. He noticed that there were potatoes in the bag that were long like carrots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This thing is crushed and steamed into a paste to eat better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃... "Have you eaten under the Highness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I have eaten in the palace banquet," Roland decided to lie, because the name of the egg is too ugly. “The royal chefs don’t call it eggs, but they are called potatoes. The delicious snacks steamed out are called mashed potatoes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s so, it’s your Royal Highness. It’s really a lot of knowledge.” Shawn exclaimed, he opened the last straight parcel and pulled out a black stick. “His Royal Highness, I think this crop is the most important. The water in Bishuigang is very cheap. To a large extent, it is because of the news I heard in the pub, that more and more farmland began to turn sugar sticks. The stalks of this magical plant turned out to be sweet. After peeling off the skin, you can extract the sugar. The price is one tenth of honey, but it tastes sweeter than honey*."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."Roland I really want to say that this kind of crop has also been seen by myself. By the way, I changed my name to sugar cane, but I still think about it. It is not too late to correct it when the farmers are planted. Sugar cane can be used as a raw material for the production of sucrose. It can also be used to refine ethanol. It is a crop that can greatly improve the happiness of residents. Think about it, the pancakes made from flour are odourless, but if you put some sugar on it, you can make the taste feel a few layers, even if the salty party like Roland will fall for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you have any other crop seeds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is nothing in the clear water port," He took out five or six bags of small skins from his pocket and gave it to His Highness. "You told me that the seeds of the gray fort and the town's plants are not brought back. These bags are all passing by Liu Yezhen and Grapes, soybeans, cotton, flax and olive tree seeds were selected when they fell in the Dragon Ridge. However, the farmers said that most of the grapes were planted by inserting the branches into the ground. Although the seeds could be planted, the germination period was very slow and they came out. The grapes are not very tasty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
