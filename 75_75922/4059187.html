			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is still gray, like a thick curtain. Countless tiny white dots fall in the wind, as if you want to fill the whole world. However, in the face of the sea that embraces the sky, even the snow in the sky is small and powerless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty of the beauty is in this snow, and gradually approached the shoal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland had been waiting here for a long time. He greeted the cold sea breeze and opened his arm to Tilly who was on the dock. "Welcome back, sister." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter took off the hood, revealing a soft gray hair, smiling and gently embracing him, everything looks so natural, "the evil moon seems to be more than I arrived early, I hope that I am not too late."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the conversation between the two, the pier suddenly became buzzing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, there will be a welcome banquet in the evening, right? Can you arrange another hot pot?" Andrea asked, and the tone was full of expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, pay attention to your words and deeds," Ashes reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s getting more and more familiar, or because of the nightingale, the calm aristocratic atmosphere seems to be disappearing a little from her – of course, The value of the face determines the basic score, and even when she actively asks for what to eat at night, her look is still elegant and pretty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Roland nodded. "In fact, winter is the best day to eat hot pot."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the same as I thought," Andrea’s eyes lit up. "It’s not a royal aristocrat, nor a man who is a nightingale..." Halfway through, her mouth was invisible. The hand is firmly stuck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash supported the forehead, turned around as if nothing had been seen, and talked with Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly seems a little surprised, she looked at Roland, and looked at the position where the nightingale was, and looked thoughtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland felt a little hot for a moment, screaming at the other side and asking for an exit, said directly coughing, "The wind is big, let's go back to the castle and talk about it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch who follows Tilly is still playing cards, and The original blood-tooth association members, Yi Fei, Yu Yu and Sundial, were not the first to come to the West, so the process of allocating rooms was omitted. After waiting for the baggage, Roland gathered everyone in the living room, and then told about what happened in the recent morning kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a partner in intelligence sharing, he believes that the Sleeping Island witch should know the people of Tahira as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard the last moment, all the witches in the room showed the look of Niu Jun, and the ashes directly asked the voice. "So you are what Taqila is looking for... ...the chosen witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or the first wizard in history," Tilly joked. "My brother is always so different." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no magic at all, and the witch is still free," Roland said helplessly. "And the winner is just the name of the Takira witch." Before, the sacred instrument was something to do with it. I had to deal with them further. Before that, I planned to hold an artillery exercise outside the Western Wall, hoping to restore their lost confidence."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s also a kind of shock, right?” Although the ashes are not unscrupulous when they first saw it, some words are still unobtrusive, “just like the one that was shown to us at the beginning. The battle of the evil spirits is the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only I don’t want to have misunderstandings with each other,” Roland said. “And the exercise is not just for the Taqila witch, it will also be open to the public, so that the people without the winter city can see the power they have, even then In the face of the devil, they will also be full of courage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of not misunderstanding is to let the other party clearly understand their strength, thus eliminating some unnecessary Thoughts, this is also the basis of diplomacy in the new era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
