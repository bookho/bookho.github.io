			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day at noon from the dream, Roland ushered in a really good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Engineering Department and the Ministry of Construction finally joined hands to complete the layout of the venues and equipment required for the "Sun Glow" program. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because theoretically 52 kilograms of spherical uranium 235 can reach criticality, elemental purification is not the biggest threshold, Lucia is busy today, Institute of High Energy Physics There are hundreds of kilograms of pure uranium accumulated in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the uranium 235 is piled up together, the power of the fission reaction cannot be fully utilized unless the amount of input is astonishing. However, as a result, its security and practicality will drop dramatically, so it needs to stimulate its energy efficiency through a specific configuration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another key point of the plan is the test explosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know that theoretical calculations are one thing, it is another matter to make them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the principle device to the actual product, it is almost impossible to want a success during this period. According to statistics, Roland has developed a number of weapons products for the First Army. The number of failures during testing is more than two digits. This is still the case with reliable drawings and witch assistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Sun's Glow" program is undoubtedly more special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other weapons manufacturing, improvement, testing can be done in one place, but fission reactions are not. Regardless of whether the result is a success or a failure, there will be a place to become a restricted area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it took nearly a month to examine the test site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the fertile plain is vast, it can be used as the main direction for the future development of the winter city, obviously not suitable as a test site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many isolated islands in the fjord, but the distance is too far. Now the sea pressure is already very high, and it is difficult to take out the ships to transport all kinds of equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desert in the south seems to be the most suitable place, but considering that there are a lot of "stickman" remains buried there, for future development and utilization, Roland Hesitated for a long time and still decided to go to the extreme south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test explosion was eventually set to the west of the Snowy Mountains - the former devil's outpost camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there may be encounters with evil spirits and demons, the risk is still accepted, and after the test, no matter whether it succeeds, it will form a polluted area, but instead Disguised to improve the security of the rear of the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two thresholds that cross the past to qualify for a nuclear test. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, please bring me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And me!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't say it, as long as it is a weapon that can kill the devil, I have to teach it anyway!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"å‘ƒ..." At the same time as receiving the message, Roland also received a request for dialogue from the third side of the city. Looking at the three "big faces" that were squeezed across from the light curtain, he couldn't help but sweat. "This is just a principle device test, which is far from the real weapon test."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since he instilled the concept of "the sun's glow" into the Tachila witch, Pasha and Celine have always been obsessed with it, but he did not expect even Elsie to join in, tone There seems to be a bit of piety in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is as good as you said, enough to illuminate the clouds over the head of humans, then I hope to witness its birth all the way." Pasha hangs down The Lord must. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have made a lot of efforts in the manufacture of the core components of Sun Hui. You can't let the participants of the program stay here?" Catherine added. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there is no authentic passage from Daxueshan to the experimental observation point..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You can rest assured that there is no sun in the evil moon, and we will have more time outside the event than usual." Elsie hurried back, seemingly afraid that he would say a word, "and the last time Fran drilled The passage is still there, and we will never attract anyone's attention when we leave the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
