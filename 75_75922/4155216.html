			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the turn of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long silence of the other party made him think that this inquiry would be returned without success. I didn’t expect the nightmare to explain the origin of the floating land. It was quite detailed, and this contrast made him unable to react at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is your expression?" Wajilis opened his eyes and did not breathe. "I did not betray the ethnic group, but I agree with Sistalli." Sri Lanka's view - the battle of divineness can't be exchanged for the continuation of the ethnic group. If it continues, it will only become a pawn of the gods, so ... it is the right thing to stop it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, that is clearly his claim. Roland subconsciously touched the back of the head. The thousand shapes before the millennium could not be connected to the conscious world. How can I know so much detail? But even if he is slow, he knows that this time should follow the other side's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you finally want to understand this." He took back the unexpected look and tried to pretend to be generous and sent out to give a hand, "despite now The gods have noticed us, but I believe that it is not too late -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris did not respond to his handshake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before that, I want to ask you a question first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the last thing is what God said, how do you deal with the relationship between my family and humanity?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightmare looks very dignified, Roland realizes that this question will determine the next thing - she can ask this key point to exit, it proves that she really began to consider the possibility of cooperation, and the future of the ethnic group The way out. He even has a hunch that if she can't accept her, she might force herself out of the dream world—even in the form of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be honest, I haven’t thought about it yet." After a moment of contemplation, Roland slowly returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris frowned and said coldly, "So you just talked about it at first, I don’t believe that I will work with you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I thought about it, but it was just too complicated." He smiled bitterly, and the answer was really not qualified, but he I don't want to make a good one at first. The other party is neither a stupid person, and painting a cake is not his own strength. Instead of being self-defeating, it is better to follow the truth of the heart. "The war between man and the devil has lasted for a thousand years. This hatred can not be eliminated in a short time. It is almost impossible to become like a dream. The way I can think of for the time being is to completely separate the two and let you leave the human world forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Where to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a question to be considered in detail later, but the outside world is so big, I guess there is always a place to accommodate "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two have been watching each other for a long time, until the heat of the coffee dissipates, Wakiris breaks the silence, "If your answer is not without thinking If you have all of them, the big probability will be a trap, but now, I think you really intend to do that."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...I didn’t think about it. Is it a qualified answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What do you think." The nightmare took a deep breath. "I admit that this is a single-wood bridge in the abyss. It is unpredictable whether it is forward or downward, but even if you want to be jealous, I must try it because - only in the ethnic group I can do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland noticed that when she said this, her hands were involuntarily pinched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously her heart is not as determined as the words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he also knows that this is by no means an easy decision. For most people, falling into the abyss is the norm - when the ending does not see the difference, giving up is a kind of relief. "You don't be too proud," Wakiris took a look at him. Ignore, if the whole world is created by it, I don't think you have a lot of chances. So the end result is probably that both groups have been completely destroyed, and even a trace will not be left behind."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
