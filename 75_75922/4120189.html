			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What method?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over there for a moment, then went on to say, "If humans Accepting the devil's perception is risky, then turning the devil into a human being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean - transfer the soul?" Roland soon thought The key to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mentioned that there is a demon in the dream world, that is to say, the successor of the falling star city has exerted the ability to extract souls from the devil. This at least proves that they are also affected by the soul instrument," Zoe explained. "After that, the higher-order devil will be transferred to the body of the warrior, and the risk of perception will be borne by this guy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that," he couldn't help but nod. The use of the godly warrior as a carrier is tantamount to forcing the devil to adapt to humans, and the sensory feedback received by the connected soul. They are also familiar information. In the case of chaos, the conscious confrontation is also easier to gain an advantage, which sounds like a good idea. "But you will also lose a container that can be transferred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the church was destroyed, the body of the sacrificial warrior was basically one less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are more willing to sleep in your dreams than an unconscious cold cage...so there is nothing wrong with it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough--" Roland almost didn't get caught in the tea, although she knew that the other person was a woman, but when she heard a sly male voice faintly said this, killing The force is still too amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just kidding," Zoe seldom chuckled. "In fact, there are several defective products in our collection, which can be used for this." Sub-transfer. Not to mention, the cost of a body is not worth mentioning compared to the possible harvest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Defective?" He cleared his throat. Asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From Hermes to our original hiding place, you need to cross the desolate mountains to reach, it is not a good way to go, especially in the demon At the time of the month, some of the gods and warriors even climbed up - because the feet have been smashed by the evil beast. The body like this can not be used as a warrior. We originally intended to use it as a container for longevity. Those nobles came to enjoy it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland secretly smacked his mouth, can you really enjoy being so alive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But even if it is a defective product, it has the same ability as a stone of punishment. If it is displayed during the connection process, will it cause anything? Question?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please rest assured that even if we want to master a strange body, it will take decades." Zoe In retrospect, "the time to stimulate the field of punishment is longer. Many people have to wait until the second transfer to use this ability. Even if the devil has an unimaginable talent in this area, it is unlikely to be during the interrogation. Do this inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha added, "Returning 10,000 steps, even if the resonance is interrupted, the pain is only temporary - - A similar situation, Hilli has personally verified it during the investigation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, have you discussed this with Ms. Carmela?" Roland Suddenly thought of a key issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have already talked about it, she has a negative attitude at first - after all, this is something that has never been tried, and no witch can be said as an interrogator. There was no risk at all, but Zoe convinced her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." He suspected that the other person was not a eloquent person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's actually very simple, sire," Zoe said. "I just told her that the person who connects the soul with the devil is not someone else, it is me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn't help but glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am both a superb and the first witch to be awakened... In this state, dealing with the devil is more sure than most people." She said calmly, "Of course, the most important thing is that I am the proponent of this program, and of course I should bear all the risks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
