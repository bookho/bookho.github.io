			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, two bowls of braised beef powder!" The boss put the noodles to the table in a red light, and wiped the table with a towel - obviously He is very proud of the presence of the martial arts family. After all, Garcia is the star of the package. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, add an omelette," Roland pulled out two pairs of chopsticks, "one person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"好咧!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I were you, I wouldn’t ask women to have breakfast here," Garcia rolled her eyes. No wonder you are still single now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is oh! If it is not the responsibility of the stalk, those gods who have punished the witch have already given him -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the guy who is going to go to school, I have to put Breakfast is sent back, if it is too far..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, the following is not an example," Garcia interrupted his words and skillfully opened the disposable chopsticks. Stir the shallots and beef on the powder, and soon a bowl of noodles becomes a seductive sauce red. The first mouth is slightly cool, not chewing slowly, but directly in the entrance, like a continuous ribbon, only a thin creak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just hearing this sound, Roland has already felt that his appetite is wide open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" He grinned. "Isn’t this way to eat? I thought you were not used to street food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's your illusion," Garcia shrugged. "I have been here for almost ten years. Which store I have not eaten? Just The clean and spacious shop is the courtesy of the guests, and I don't like to always be stared at."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland found that it was not just the other on the stall Customers, even those who pass by, will curiously look into this direction - after all, Garcia's silver-gray hair and well-proportioned figure are really eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...is my negligence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So hurry and say good business, "Jiacia blinked. "What are you looking for in such an eagerness? The martial arts association will not help you to do something illegal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy... Eyes are so alert? I came back from the headquarters yesterday and can do anything illegal. Besides, is there something more illegal than a hunting certificate? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland hesitated the little meeting, "I want to see your master, can you help me with the time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啥?" The other party did not respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your master...Mrs.岚." He made up a casual reason. "I was very embarrassed about the last time I missed the appointment and wanted to apologize to her." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiacia looked at him for a long time without knowing him, and finally waved his hand, "Oh? Now know how important it is to get a referral from my master." But save it, she won't see you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe Ms. I hate me as you think?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you still want to say that she has kindly explained many things to you at the newcomers' meeting," Garcia disagreed. "Don't think about it, the chances of missing will not be heavy." Come, the master will never take care of a person who is not punctual, let alone meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Try it first," Roland Stick to the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." Garcia seems to have noticed something, "Isn’t I really want to apologize to her?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you can consult some martial arts training methods, it is better," he pretended a serious face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former took a slap in the mouth, mostly wanting him to completely give up this unrealistic thought, she finally took out the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s no use telling you, it’s not the association’s data card. It’s impossible to get to the headquarters.” Garcia made a quiet gesture. “Hey, hello, it’s me...”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call only lasted for less than three minutes and she hung up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know this is the result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is rejected! I even blamed me for a meal," Garcia did not have a good air. "Your image has completely gone bankrupt in her mind, mentioning You, her voice is at least one octave lower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this? Roland couldn't help but feel a little puzzled. According to the attitude of the newcomers' meeting, he obviously did not care about his loss of appointment. Instead, he still had a slight value. He thought that the secret language of the other party was the use of the power of nature to the depths. It was not surprising that Jia Xia was unclear, but now it seems that he really couldn’t hear it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, he did not insist on knowing the answer to the puzzle. He even hesitated to enter the dream world. Now he is frustrated. He is not willing to give up on it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Roland drank his soup. "When can we go to the headquarters again?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you solve the erosion incident alone and become the official martial artist - you are just a newcomer just getting started."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This condition is surprisingly simple, Roland thought. However, he is ostensibly on the surface. "I will look forward to that day. Right, do you remember the opening remarks of Ms. Yu when we first arrived at the bottom of the earth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does it mean when she says that the battle of God is not far from us?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Garcia has some helplessness. "My master appreciates a book written half a century ago. It is called "The Reason for Being" and I have recommended it. The book has made some conjectures about the emergence and evolution of civilization, calling it the choice of the gods. Of course, this god is not a personification role, but a rule, or the purpose of the continuation of everything. It’s too far away, it has nothing to do with us, and books are only circulated in the martial arts associations, so almost no one knows.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing here, Roland On the heart. There is no doubt that this is another book he has not seen - which means it comes from the self-creation of the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you show me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Book at headquarters, wait for me next I went to the library to borrow when I was in office.” Garcia gave him a strange look. “If I remember this.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing each other’s suspicions Roland quickly smashed the noodles and excused himself to leave the store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a dream world at the end of the next day, he took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t touch the martial arts association, it’s as if everything is normal in your dreams, but as long as you get along with them, you will end up with nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This search is not very smooth, but it is not nothing. What's more, the long-awaited goddess of witches once again gained the experience of recovery of consciousness, and seeing their delightful appearance, this trip is not in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is planning to open the dream world several times during this rest time, speeding up the speed of his time, when lightning flies into a swallowtail eagle Camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, there is your expedited secret letter," the little girl muttered. "It was sent from No Winter City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westbound Direct? This journey is not too close. Is there any change in the winter city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to save the messenger resources, the less urgent news is sent to the old king capital through ships, and then transferred by Tassa and others, such as government reports, etc. Wait. The swallow-tailed eagle is the largest and most expensive type of animal messenger. The advantage is that it is at the top of the food chain and has high safety. The disadvantage is that it will take up a considerable part of the control share of the witch. Driving such a raptor is almost equivalent to three gray hawks, which is quite laborious for honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
