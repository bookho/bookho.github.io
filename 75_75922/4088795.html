			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky was just whitish, the broken sword was fully awake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned over and went to the window and pushed open the window--the chilly morning wind suddenly poured into the room, with the coolness of the snow melting time. There is no shortage of fragrance for spring recovery. The blue sky has not yet been fully illuminated, but from the sparse clouds, today will be a good day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wearing clothes to the living room, a plate of roasted nuts has been placed on the table, plus a can of vegetable soup, which is exactly the weight of four people - among them Anne always gets up early, not only the first wash, but occasionally the breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they officially joined the Witch Alliance, they moved from the diplomatic building to the Witch Building, and they can go to the castle for three meals at any time, but Anne often chooses to do it herself. In the first month of receiving the salary, she went to the convenience market to buy cooking materials such as firewood, butter, and salt. She went to the wild to collect some wild fruits and vegetables every week, and did it every other time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword has also curiously asked her why she is doing this, and Anne’s answer is very simple, she said that survival in the wild is a skill, if long No, it will be forgotten after a long time. If you need to escape again, how can you ensure that you survive safely? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some inability to understand the idea that the other side is always ready to wander, but then, occasionally taste the fruits of these wild vegetables, and the taste is quite good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good morning," she sat at the table and pulled her nutty road. "Do you want to go to the factory today?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Annie nodded and drank the last hot soup in the bowl. "Some big objects can't be pressed, the machine can't plug in such a big thing, only I spliced ​​it with small pieces of iron. I heard that Miss Anna was doing it before, but now it is all handed over to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her voice, Broken swords can hear a faint satisfaction and sense of accomplishment, which is probably the most significant change after the four people came to the city without the winter - their ability is no longer meaningless, for the work of the majesty, to receive remuneration, It's like a craft. This experience of relying on oneself rather than stealing or relying on the charity of others gives the broken sword a sense of renewedness. She believes that Anne has the same feelings, otherwise she will not get up early every day without the pressure of survival, and the first one will go to the factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today is a special day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't forget the hero she is today..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Annie looks serious A lot, "Reassured, I will finish the work over there and get it on time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword broke a little relieved, "Well, there is you." In the end, she can be more at ease."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I am leaving." She got up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go, the hero has me to take care of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hot water is placed in the kitchen The rest is handed over to you.” Anne did not talk more and quickly left her residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sword has finished eating it, go to the kitchen and hit the hot water, walk lightly into the hero's bedroom - lost his feet, life For the sake of inconvenience, even if the room is adequate, she usually sleeps with Annie. During the day, the three people take turns taking care of them, and Miss Efe and Wendy will often come to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised her was that the hero was awake at this moment, sitting on the bed and looking out the brighter window. The soft dawn reflected on her lavender hair and white face, looking calm and pleasing, and looking at this scene, it is hard to imagine how cruel the treatment she had suffered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the broken sword quickly reacted, and the other person’s mood is not as calm as it seems on the surface, so it will start much earlier than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good morning," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah... good morning," the hero trembled a little, as if he had recovered from the hairpin, sorry, "I have to trouble you again." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
