			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The day after the funeral was held, a message from No Winter City made the frontline engineering team boil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has prepared a visit for them, and all workers who have worked for three months can get a paid holiday for a day, and then they will The long-lost family will arrive at the Lost Forest Terminal in winter and spend this precious day together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a deliberate decree made everyone grateful. As soon as the news arrived, the voice of the long-lived king was everywhere, and the strength of working hard increased. A few points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Snake is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when the foreman found him, looking at the contact list, he could not even believe his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the line that belongs to him on the list, the name of "white paper" almost made his mind fall into a blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, do you disagree with this arrangement?" Snake teeth also clearly remember the slight impatience of the foreman, or from seeing the list to Every detail of the name was recorded by him in detail, and every time he thought about it, he would unconsciously open his mouth. "First, if you have any objections, you can change the name. The Executive Office will ask again, but if it is rejected, the holiday can be cancelled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;For the sake of saving trouble, the foreman naturally hopes that the list can be passed once, but the snakes are clear and the other party does not understand his mood at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t say that he has raised an objection, he just wants to hold on to the Executive Officer who prepared the list. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree, 100% consent!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, since I agreed to say it early, and I was there like a fool." The foreman gave him a blank look, waiting for him to sign the name and then find the next person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth stayed in place, looking at the palm of his hand holding the pen for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, he has the idea of ​​"If this is a dream, simply don't wake up." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the absence of winter city, the white figure is different - he dare not come forward to say hello because he is afraid of being rejected, the other is now the witch alliance One member, and wearing and looking are not the same as the thin girl in the past. If the white paper is not willing to be related to the mouse, his appearance will only add to her troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the name of the white paper appears on the list, which means that the Executive Office has already inquired her beforehand, and she also agreed to this visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene that is most worried has not happened, and you can get a chance to get along with each other. For Snakes, there is nothing more exciting than this. Now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, he was in the midst of eager and excited expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the large number of visitors, and the limited capacity of the train, the removal of goods can only pull more than 100 people at a time, so even in the first list of visits, wait until When it arrived that day, it was basically a week later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kid, is it your turn today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s so clean, it’s a girl "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't forget the time at night!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the same room workers The sound of the play, the snake's teeth blushing out of the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the famous brand boarded the train, he only took a sigh of relief - no matter what, only the last hour was left when he saw the white paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people in the carriage constantly reading the precautions, such as not being able to leave the warning zone of the forest terminal without permission, after the meeting is at least 8 o'clock, no more than the specified time, In the event of an emergency, you should immediately follow the instructions of the First Army and so on. However, the snake tooth has heard it many times since the overcoming population, and my heart is already ripe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get off the bus, line up the team, don't squeeze!" the station staff who rushed to and yelled, "This is not a grocery shopping, you can't miss one!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp There was a sneer in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snake tooth feels heart pounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more restrained, the stronger it becomes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He envisioned countless kinds of meetings in his mind, and repeated exercises for it, but it’s really a moment, he still feels dry and clumsy. Like a fat pigeon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the pretty figure really appeared in front of him, Snakes found that everything he had imagined disappeared without a trace, except for smirking, no more Can't say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that you live in a no-winter area, it's great!" The girl sprinted and sprinted and grabbed his hand. No hesitation, no disgusting, the gap between the two years with this smile, the ice is melting, everything is like the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, Snakes felt that it was a perfect choice to have no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, shortly after you recovered in the long song area, you will be here." Come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked side by side on the forest trail, unlike the noisy camp center, which is much quieter and more solitude. She hasn't seen her for a long time. She seems to have countless words to say, like wanting to fill up the missing blanks, and the snakes have a question and answer. Compared with the old boss and the followers, the two are more like a pair. Partner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the mouse organization was completely eradicated, and a lot of job recruitment was released in the square. If it is mixed up as before, it will be finished sooner or later." Nodded, "I and the tiger's claws together, there is no winter, the same work, the salary here is higher, and ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And can be closer to you. However, this sentence just flashed through his heart and did not say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's not hard that I didn't find you, you guys are no longer there." White paper sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You later... Have you ever been to a long song?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trusted." The girl said slowly, "I realized that you have left the West after the entire Alley Corner has been dismantled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original...this is the case." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But since you have come to winter, why don't you take the initiative to find me?" asked the white paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this - it’s a long story," Snake coughed. "At the time, I had nothing to do with the tiger claws, in order to have a fixed place." Every day from morning to night, I forgot it for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This excuse is even worse for himself, one forget is two years, then and fundamentally Can't remember the difference? It’s just that I’m embarrassed to say hello and see that I’m deliberately avoiding this shameful thing. It’s absolutely impossible to say it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, there is no deep research on white paper. "I am also, when I first came to the winter city, I was too busy to turn around. Help the engineering team accelerate the cement solidification. I will be an assistant to Ai Gesha, and go to the chemical factory to help create all kinds of strange things." She squinted her fingers. "Your majesty said that my ability can speed up the reaction process and improve the energy level of the compound. I am very Curious how he knows - according to the book, those particles are much smaller than sesame. Can you imagine? If you look at the atom as big as the opera house, its core is less than a walnut size... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to a completely incomprehensible discourse, the snake tooth can only nod and should, and for a moment, he does feel the change of the other party, and the difference between the two . But more, his eyes stayed on the other side's smiles - the glittering eyes, the slightly raised eyelashes, the thin nose, the opening and closing lips... everything is so fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that there is an impulse in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
