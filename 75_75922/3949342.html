			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" The night owl looked at the black, bright stone on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Obsidian." Roland did not lift his head and concentrated on drawing the drawings in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black...What stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I am nonsense." He sighs A tone, look at the shape and color, the ghost knows what stone it is. He is not studying geological exploration. Pure metal is not necessarily distinguished by him, let alone ore. The only knowledge in the head tells him that the ores are mostly complex compounds, and the different colors of the impurities are different. Let’s take the iron ore, the hematite, pyrite, and siderite It is completely different, especially pyrite, sometimes showing a pale yellow metallic luster, often mistaken for gold mines, so there is the nickname of Fool's Gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the high temperature resistance... The compound itself has no fixed melting point. It is also related to impurities and components, and the temperature cannot be distinguished by the temperature alone. Moreover, the metal element exists in an ionic state, and the purification method is not known, and it is not useful when it is burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have something you don't know?" The nightingale was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More," Roland put down the quill and made himself a cup of black tea. "Do you want to drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," she waved her hand. "Right, beef jerky is not grilled with fish fillets. After that, you can still put fish fillets in your drawer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Roland was silent for a moment and decided not to hear this. This stone is also intended to be thrown to the alchemist Kemer Spoel to deal with. Minerals are more or less radioactive, and it is not a good choice to be in the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the recent evolution of Soloja’s ability, he is now able to create a lot more suddenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the water system, which is something that can greatly enhance the happiness of the residents. Think about it, after a busy day, sweating back home, wanting to clean the slimy body, but the water tank is empty, but also to go to the nearby well to fetch water, this feeling is definitely awful. Moreover, Roland is also very tired of washing his hands from the water tank to wash his hands. He always feels that the water can be long parasites in the tank for a few days, not to mention that the water tanks are rarely cleaned once a month. Look carefully. When you get there, you can see the scale deposited on the bottom of the tank fluttering like a caterpillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you use water tower water supply, there is no technical difficulty - use the steam engine to pump the water from the Chishui River into the water tower, and then follow the siphon principle along the pipeline Into each household, an automatic water supply system was formed. The reason why Roland has not been implemented is... materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water supply pipe is either iron or copper. If the iron pipe is not rust-proof, it will be scrapped in a few years. The copper pipe is a perfect water supply pipe, corrosion-resistant, the inner wall is not fouling, non-toxic, and even copper ions have a bactericidal effect, but the metal of the casting currency is used to make the water pipe? The output of the North Slope mine is far from being extravagant to this point. Even in later generations, copper water pipes are considered for high-end residential buildings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Bianbu Town is not only unable to export minerals, but even to import metal ingots. Therefore, whether it is iron pipe or copper pipe, Roland is reluctant to use it to create a water supply system that cannot be used for pure enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s different now, with Soroya’s coating, it means he can empty the white wolf and use magic to produce water pipes – for example, take one The root iron pipe is used as a mold, and the paper is placed on the outside of the paper, and then the Soroya is covered with the coating. After the mold is taken out, it becomes a pipe. Even if such a water pipe does not resist pressure, it can be placed in a water pipe groove with a cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the power supply system...I am afraid that there is no way to popularize the whole town in a short time, but letting the castle be filled with light has always been what Roland wants to achieve. The faint candlelight reading is too painful, and it hurts a lot of eyes, plus summer is coming, what is the feeling of full of torches and candles on a hot night? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now motors and wires that make it too far away for the castle to enter the electrical age. As for the filament of the bulb... He vaguely remembers that before the application of tungsten wire, carbonized bamboo filaments were commonly used to make incandescent lamps. Bamboo is not a rarity, there is forest land south of the Chishui River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
