			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's here," said the dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a ventilated pipe fence, a group of people carefully looked around the environment - here is probably a large factory building, with bridges on both sides . The space below is empty, except for a few discarded old-fashioned machine tools and a conveyor belt covered with rust. Obviously, before the closure, the owner of the factory removed all the equipment worthy of disassembly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the factory that should have been quiet, there are several torches burning at the moment. Under the low-light vision, the swaying flame is almost white-green, and the light is even glaring. In the central position of the fire, you can see twenty twisted figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those people are our goals?" Luo Hua asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The estimate is wrong," answered him as an old martial artist. "I can feel the power fluctuations that they do not hide, from the perspective of the fall." It is the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The so-called final period means that the consciousness as a person is completely lost, and it has completely become the embarrassment of erosion. At this time, the demon is basically the same as the beast. It will not communicate with others any more, and will only follow instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They - also used to be martial arts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily, although the association has There have been a lot of records of martial arts, but in general, erosion is more likely to occur in wild awakened people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I saw it for the first time The living sorcerer, but the martial art who lacks the enterprising spirit and the self-discipline will become a waste no matter what it becomes." Luo Hua sneaked into the nose, "Sadly guys... They are not worthy of possessing the power of nature. Captain, now solve it. Let's get rid of this group of monsters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute," the dragon scorpion calmly stopped the road. "It seems that there are still demons who are gathering here. - The more enemies we deal with, the less stress we have on the periphery. And don't you feel weird? Since it is the demon who entered the final stage, do not instinct to hunt those wild awakened, what to do here I always feel that things will not be so simple... if we can find out their intentions, maybe it’s more than direct annihilation It makes more sense "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; While many people exchanging views on the situation, but Roland's eyes that were often falls prodigy body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing the cold, the "陛下" always dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that in a few seconds, his emotions have risen and fallen with this sentence, and he has been practicing for many years in the Grey Fortress. He is so uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he first heard this familiar title, he almost thought that Elena’s soul was attached to the other side, and he almost called his name out. Only in the end, his reason has swallowed back the words - if Fiji is really the new body of Elena in the dream world, then it is impossible to tell the self-introduction from the beginning, not even Sitting with him without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sudden change from joy to disappointment was not good, when Roland was almost not injured. As for why the other party will inexplicably shout out the words of the next, it is not difficult to draw a conclusion when it is slightly recalled - Jia Xia once said that the Wudao family's five senses are much higher than ordinary people, and some talents are better at this. In addition, the other party also participated in the dinner of the Sanye Group, which must have heard the dialogue between him and the witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is, to what extent did the Fijian language know about his origins? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the obvious heuristics of the other side, Roland thinks she doesn’t know much, at least she knows nothing about another world outside of dreams. . But this still makes his heart alarm, and any sense of autonomy does not hope that he is actually an illusory existence. Once the mystery of the dream world is revealed, it will inevitably bring unpredictable consequences - and it is very likely that this consequence will It is catastrophic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiacia did not say anything wrong, Fiji is the person he most needs to watch out for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm? You see, the new demon... seems to be a bit different." Just then, the low voice from the headphones Interrupted Roland’s thoughts, “It seems to be commanding other demons.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Isn't the traitor who is not completely defamed?" The dragon lord wondered, "What do they want to play?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several old martial arts are also wrinkled With a brow, compared to the end of the beastly, the opponents between the seemingly inhuman and the inhuman are often more difficult. They lose the compassion in human nature, but retain the blackmail and sin, can do At this point, most of them are well-known awakened people before the fall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嘘-" The fierce language of the silence has suddenly opened its mouth. "Quiet, there is movement in the box. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone immediately held their breath.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, she was silent. "The inside is... people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard a small cry and a cry of sorrow, as if it was blocked by a mouth. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, the box is probably an innocent ordinary person? "The dragon is surprised. "I have never seen a similar thing in the records of the association before. - Although the demon is not afraid of killing, it is not intended to find ordinary people to start." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as everyone looked at each other, the enemy who seemed to be the leader suddenly became loud. "It's time, children!" God is approaching, and God is eager to sacrifice! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"吼-! "Other sorcerers have shouted.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, let power be attributed to the source, let God return to the earth!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"吼————! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The destruction of this world, the return will be our new life!" Give everything to the gods - the sacrifice begins! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Devils suddenly made a deafening noise!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn, we must Acted. "The captain gnashed his teeth, though he never heard that the demon would organize to take ordinary people to sacrifice, let alone to please the gods like cults, but the truth is that they must not sit idly by innocent civilians. In fact, saving people is even more important than destroying the demon--the core spirit of the martial arts association is protection. "Everyone is as close as possible to the box, keep this group of monsters out, let go one or two, no matter what, believe The outside folks - they will solve it for us! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finanese noodles noisy, the first one rushed out of the hiding place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Others followed, as a scabbard into the enemy group.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dusty factory has boiled in an instant !<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slayers were caught unprepared, their unbreakable bodies were broken under the bombardment of natural forces, and once the core was isolated, it would Into the shackles.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland is at the end of the team, while the teammates are broken, while carefully hiding their abilities - this is not his first time with The sorcerer's hands, the battle (group gang) experience is much higher than the rest of the team. Unlike those martial artists who have awakened the power of nature, he does not need to fight with the enemy, as long as he is met, The demon person will lose power, and then he will be beaten unilaterally. In addition, he will not dare to touch the red cyclone that has been stripped out. The sight of the core spiral will be seen by everyone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other worms on the shoulders are also slightly shaking, which proves that Felice and others have already rushed When I arrived at the scene, there was a meat shield in front, and in the case of support, Roland became more and more comfortable. Although his skill seemed to be the most unpretentious one, the enemy that was actually knocked down was only second to Fiji. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the attention of the entire main battle team is now on those few boxes, plus his deliberate disguise, no one is in chaos I noticed this unusual scene.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything went very smoothly, and after only paying the price of several injuries, the group rushed to the container.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
