			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sat in front of his desk, he didn’t expect anyone to dare to kill the castle. If it’s not a nightingale, he’s afraid Poisoned hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is this time? Three king sisters, or other brothers and sisters? Do you want to be so anxious, the five-year battle for the king, now only a few months, Roland slaps the table irritably, simply do not care, can you let yourself have a good winter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a footstep outside the door, and the chief knight, Carter Lannes, pushed in. "His Highness, the identity of the deceased has been identified, and there are seven of the eight bodies." It is a member of the original patrol team, and the identity of one person is unknown. The other two are still alive, one is a witch... No, after being treated by Miss Pine, they still have not woken up. One has been put into the dungeon and is strictly guarded."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol? I knew that this team raised by the former lord couldn't stand it. Roland gnawed his teeth and thought that there were actually eight rebellions among the ten people. It would be the right choice not to let this group join the militia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The one that is locked up, you remind your men to keep an eye on it, don't be like the last time, and let people commit suicide by taking poison!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Last...that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, nothing," Roland shook his head, and it seemed that the early morning was called by the nightingale. Even the head is confused. "In short, I want to know everything from his mouth, who is the ambassador, who will contact, and who will buy it, and these will be handed over to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, Your Highness," Carter did not leave immediately after he finished speaking. Instead, he kneeled down on one knee. "This time, letting the assassin sneak into the castle is my dereliction of duty. I hope that the temple will be punished."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough, you were not in the castle at the time, it has nothing to do with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." Carter hesitated, " Can you tell me who stopped the assassination at the time? I saw them from the scene..." The Cavaliers swallowed. "They all seem to have been killed by the same person, and they have no power to fight back." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; "? This can tell you," Roland curious said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are evenly matched, the scene will not be so clean, the wounds will be different," Carter whispered. "Everyone is not big." In the warehouse, except for the blood and the body, almost no objects were placed on the ground. The big boxes that store the cured meat did not leave any sword marks on them. That is, the person did not use any cover. Wandering in a small open space. IMHO, Your Highness, this is incredible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out," Roland nodded, and he understood each other. the meaning of. After being surrounded by a theoretically strong person, they will fall into an extremely unfavorable situation. In actual combat, it will not appear as a movie, and people will still be on the ground one by one. Attacks in blind areas of vision will be particularly deadly. So with one-to-many, the correct countermeasure is to rely on the terrain and the environment, so that you always face the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the nightingale is not an ordinary person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, you should do what you should do first. This person can't show up for the time being, I will tell you when the time is right." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the chief knight is loyal and reliable to himself, and knows that Anna and Nanava are witches, Roland still chooses to conceal the existence of the nightingale. Because she is different from the other two witches, she does not belong to her own side. The reason for staying in the town is only for Anna. Behind her is a witch's help, and sooner or later she will leave here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter lost his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland understands his ideas, as a sword-bearing man, constantly practicing the swordsmanship summed up and accumulated over the centuries, and blaming the truth . But when you see an incomprehensible sight, you are bound to have doubts about yourself. If swordsmanship can be so subtle, what is it that he is proud of on weekdays? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you would call me out," the nightingale showed a figure, she was still sitting at the corner of the desk, said with her legs crossed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too. Otherwise, you will settle down here, as my dark guard, the salary of two golden dragons per month, more than Anna. Double, do you want to think about it?” Roland started Amway again. “The house has a garden. It takes two days off a week. Every year, there are paid holidays—hey, it means to take a break and get a reward.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
