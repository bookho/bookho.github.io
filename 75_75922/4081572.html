			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale suddenly opened up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other evil beasts have hesitated after witnessing this amazing scene, no longer frantically blocking her way as before, but squatting to stop It seems that I am afraid of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These mixed species feel the fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster hanging from the top of the cave waved the tentacles and made a roar of anger, but this urged the effect to be minimal, and the only one who had obeyed it commanded the blame. There are only three surviving ones that can no longer threaten the action of the nightingale, and the tight line of defense has now become fragmented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No enemy can stop her anymore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale whipped up the little magic left in the body and rushed toward the center of the dome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the distance keeps getting closer, she finally understands what the frustration in Fran's mouth means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is not so much a creature, but rather a bunch of exposed organs, it has neither epidermis nor muscle tissue, full of blood vessels The intestines, tentacles, and organs that are not named are stacked one on top of the other, looking awkward and terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention to throw the explosives into the monster’s mouth is obviously impossible – the nightingale casts its gaze on a squirming “carcass”, despite I don't know if it is a deadly organ of a monster, but its position is at least much more inward than the intestines, and it is full of magical brilliance. When explosives explode, it will inevitably cause more damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are some risks, she has no chance to retry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matchup must be fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closer you are to the target, the more you can feel the sheer size of the nightingale. The intricate intestines of the group are full of house thickness, and other organs are more It is like a castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this castle is alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the sickle beast can't stop her footsteps, the monsters themselves move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its body emits countless slender tentacles in an attempt to block the approach of the nightingale. Some tentacles are like steel whip. When falling, they can make the rock split. This kind of attack is not too difficult to deal with. Just pay attention to the contour change of the tentacles in advance, and use the "fracture" that will appear at any time to avoid the wall. The same line of defense that penetrates it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is a lot more tricky, a small amount of tentacles contains magic, and can display different abilities - the magical brilliance of the different colors in black and white The world is particularly eye-catching, and the nightingale doesn't want to try to remember what it is. It can only be avoided as much as possible by flashing, which is equivalent to exacerbating the consumption of its own magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there is no difference between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several ups and downs, she set foot on the monster's strong body, the latter roaring angrily, but afraid to hurt herself, not dare Attack with your tentacles. The nightingale suddenly felt a lot of pressure on her body. She did not hesitate to open the backpack and take out a box of explosives and rushed straight toward the meat sac. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next move is almost in one go - pull out the lead, stuff the blue smoked explosive with the backpack into the meat sac, and then rotate the foggy world. Let the earth change back to the sky again, and then a slamming of the feet, the whole person is like an arrow from the string, falling toward the stirring underground lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster also found this. It doesn’t seem to understand why the enemy did everything and did nothing, so he left. As for the bag, there is no threat in it. For a time it even forgot to pursue the witch who was quickly detached, and all the tentacles were in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to borrow the mid-air is the most dangerous place in the foggy world. Once it crashes, it hits the contour of the airflow, and the end is divided. So the nightingale interrupted the ability, and by the way to the top of the monster compared to the goodbye gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When testing the power of gunpowder, he often turned his back on the test site, and the famous warrior never looked back at the explosion. Although this will always attract her and Ai Gesha's eyes, he is happy, as if to complete a ritual that only he himself knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this scene, the nightingale can not help but raise his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the moment she does not want to imitate each other's appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't matter if it is a true warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just wants to see the monster being blown up and broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the sound of the collision between the lake and the dark river is clearly identifiable, the darkness of the black hole suddenly glows red! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bottom of the sky, this light is even less than the dawn of dawn, the darkness quickly fades away, leaving a long shadow behind everything. For the first time on the surface of the lake, there was a wave of ripples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then is the thrill of the people--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole cave is shaking in the mountains! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale clearly saw that under the splendid fireworks, the monster's body violently contracted as if it suffered great pain. The "Red Moon" covered on the dome is suddenly missing half of it. Some organs are like volcanic eruptions. The fire near the explosion point directly ignites the fire and smokes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噗通!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she fell into the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is quiet and quiet, only the rumbling of the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-speed rotating water under her body formed a bottomless black hole, the huge suction is like a giant hand, wanting to drag her into the abyss In the face of such power, any struggle will not help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s good to be prepared at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She released the last bit of magic, summoned the fog again, and then jumped out of the water like a stairway with a spiral of white lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the magic in her body has been exhausted, and the sequela of overuse has begun to appear, with intense pain and dizziness rushing into her brain. The trembling of the limbs made her almost unable to control her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Struggling to climb the shore of the lake, the strength of the nightingale was lost, and before the consciousness dissipated, she saw a worm break out, followed by a golden The figure rushed towards her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Night...Is it okay?" Fran asked worriedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing serious, just exhausted the magic," Aegusa roughly checked and handed her over to the goddess of witches. To carry her, we will evacuate this place as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the nightingale insisted on leaving, everyone decided to wait until the explosion sounded, regardless of the situation, rushed out to meet her. In case she is alone in the trap. For this reason, all the dry food is filled with Fran's stomach. Although it is impossible to guarantee that she has developed an escape route, she can at least follow them to the scheduled camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result did not expect this explosion effect to be amazing, after the roar, the worm carrier that penetrated the stone wall stopped the action, and other evil beasts fled. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give it to me," Elena took over the unconscious nightingale. After this battle, the Tsemilla survivors took the blond hair. The witch is obviously more respectful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't make up a few more?" Lightning looked at the top of the hole and struggled with the twisted monster, some were not willing to say, "It looks like it is still dead. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The trap of the beast is the most dangerous, and you can bring up a box of explosives at most, or don't take the risk," Ai Ge Sha Shen The voice echoed, "When the first army is assembled, it will only have a dead end sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
