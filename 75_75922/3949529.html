			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think he will promise?" After Pei retire, the night is Asked in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, and he promised that it was of little use, and he had to convince Earl of Hermon to do it," Roland drank hot tea, "if He still intends to be a landlocked aristocrat, and that can only be said to be regrettable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't bear it, right?" she joked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I can’t bear it," Roland said. "In the nobility, he is neither pedantic nor knows the opportunity. He is also very good at business and trade, as long as he is The Song Fortress has been working for a year and a half, and is definitely an excellent official who can stand alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he persuaded Count Helmon, you really planned Give the king to him to manage?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I unify the gray castle, the king naturally has to change places... and the city far from the west, the most Well, the people sent out by the West have been managed, so the conditions I have opened are not empty talks.” Roland revealed to Pei Luo at the end of the conversation that he would not divide any nobles in the future, and after integrating the gray castle, the whole territory of the kingdom In accordance with the model of the new city, they will jointly implement a law, a policy, and all powers will be attributed to the central government. If he decides to stay, the Long Song Fortress is far from the end of his political participation. It is not impossible to rule the big city or become the chief official of the Central Executive Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for what step you can do, you have to look at his own abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland hopes that the other party will be able to comprehend the expectations contained in this statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I don't understand this anyway," the night slap patted his shoulder. "But the new witch is coming soon, you still It’s better to leave for a while.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you asking?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will Wendy called, "The voice from the side of the body chuckled. "She is better at me than I am."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witches Alliance for security reasons (mainly The proposal from the book), when accepting a foreign witch, must first confirm the identity of the other party by nightingale. Roland is not allowed to be present because he must remove the stone of the gods in the fog state, so that the other party will suddenly be in trouble and cause an accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book even has ten general questions for identifying identity, such as "Where are you from?", "Your real name", "Do you know the prince?" "Whether it is hostile to the prince", etc., considering that the nightingale can only judge the authenticity of its own identity, and cannot see through the convincing lies, these questions are inquired from various aspects, leaving almost no dead ends. Even if you can mix one or two, you can't answer everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland himself was quite a bit sorrowful, but considering that the witches were also out of good intentions, they had to go with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the living room, he returned to the office and immediately called the town hall manager Barov. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyro found out in the Long Song Fortress that the new witch’s report made him aware of his negligence, even though he sent Nana Va Declaring the existence of the witch in the town, but there is never a decree directly indicating the treatment and status of the witches. Therefore, there may be a situation like a fortress in Bianbu Town. After knowing that he is a witch, he still chooses to hide his identity instead of taking the initiative to stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as Barov entered the door, Roland ordered, "I want to post a long-term recruitment announcement, and the content is written on this draft paper." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the drafting document and quickly read it again, "Do you want to recruit witches with a monthly salary of Golden Dragon?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Roland nodded. "This is also the standard salary of the Witch Alliance." A Golden Dragon's monthly salary is definitely a top salary in this era, and the town's salary level is generally higher than other In the city, the highest-paid sour factory workers have climbed to twenty silver wolves, while witches are five times more. This recruitment not only illustrates the treatment of witches, but also confirms their status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
