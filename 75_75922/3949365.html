			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirror problem was finally solved by Soroya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She refers to the mercury taken from the laboratory and draws a bright coating directly on the glass, similar to the effect of the mercury mirror. The risk of mercury vapor poisoning has been removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirror surface of the overall smear is better than the mirror with silver paste. Roland simply makes a batch of crystal glassware for each witch. A small mirror that is easy to carry. This small gift that clearly sees his appearance makes the witches happy, and even the usual flat-faced book reveals a smile, which makes him have to feel that although the witch is infertile, the essence is still a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this convenient daily necessities can not be sold to the public at a low price. The crystal glass as the substrate is expensive, and the laboratory needs to consume a large amount of glass to make it. Colorless and transparent container. Kemer Spoel knows how to make colorless glass, but the lab is heavy and it's really empty – most apprentices are busy purifying two acids, soaking the fire cotton, while the chief alchemist carries two Three disciples devote themselves to the capture of the mercury sulphate mark. Before the industrial acidification method was researched, they did not want to make other things for the time being. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the mirror, the movement of the object distance is also changed from the finger to the stage to the knob to control the movement of the barrel. These changes need only be raised by Roland. Two sentences, Anna will be able to understand the truth. Under the black fire processing, the new fixed bracket was quickly processed, and the two sets of the most magnified lens barrels were selected, and the first complete optical microscopes were obtained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the afternoon sun shining, Roland brought all members of the Witch Alliance to the backyard of the castle, and the first natural biology class officially began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Lily walked into the backyard, she found that the plants here were more luxuriant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grapes on the wooden frame have turned into bright purple, she remembers less than a week before the last maturity. When lightning strikes, I fly from time to time, picking up a bunch of ripe grapes and throwing them to everyone. And the big stupid bird that was newly added to Bianbu Town simply stood on the shelf and picked up the grapes in one mouth and swallowed it in the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shade of the center of the backyard, His Royal Highness is talking to Anna and looks like a close couple, but Lily knows that they are definitely not saying Love words. If you come close to listening, you will definitely hear a bunch of inexplicable nouns and ignorant debates... such as what the ball looks like, a dead and alive cat, a substance that turns into a wave, and so on. It is also the reason that people keep a distance of more than five meters - it will definitely make people sleepy after listening for a long time! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter is always with the book, always smiling and gentle. Sometimes she even thinks that the other person’s eyes are like watching a child. Lily sighed helplessly, aiming at Wendy's chest, and then bowing her head, there is a world of difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When can it be like that, it’s not a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the witches arrived, His Royal Highness Roland placed two gray-black metal objects on the table, which should be the microscope he claimed to see the subtle world. . Lily thinks, maybe the object will really become different after it is enlarged, but everything in the world is made up of small balls? This is always unbelievable. How can a round ball form a solid rock? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Highness gave the guard a bucket of water and took a few drops under the microscope - unlike Lily’s expectations, the bucket was neither turbid nor dirty. It looks crystal clear under the light, and it seems that there is nothing. Is it... can you see the flowing ball under the microscope? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is something moving in the water!" To her surprise, the exclamations of the sisters came one after another, "Oh, it ran!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than one, there seems to be a lot more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, is this a bug? They It’s not the same!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This looks like a transparent crab...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lily’s heart was suddenly hoisted, not a small ball is a bug? His Royal Highness is deceiving! However... there are bugs that are very strange. Just look at the water to see what is wrong! When it was her turn, the little girl couldn’t care about it, and she couldn’t wait to squint her eyes and put her head close to the microscope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
