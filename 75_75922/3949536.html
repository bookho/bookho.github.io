			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the basement of the Sirte House, the film is no stranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was a child, he used it as his own amusement park, and he found a strange thing from all kinds of dusty boxes. It was very rich. Fun things. Of course, he did not despise his father's jealousy. In the end, he was even forbidden to enter the basement alone, but the film always found a way to sneak in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz took him into the innermost stone room, and saw that the wall was inlaid with a fist-sized light blue spar - the film could not help but suck The mouth is cool, every stone is actually the finest stone of punishment. I didn’t know about it in childhood, but now he naturally understands what it means. The high-quality god stone is worth a lot, like such a big head. At least five or six hundred Jinlong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silter's family was so rich? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly remembered that the treasure map was also turned out of this room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a circle of boxes around the stone room. The layout and memory are not much different. Sir Sirte pulls out a bunch of keys and opens the largest of them. The box, with the sound of the slamming out of the box, the house suddenly raised a dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling held his breath and looked into the box - it was divided into several layers, similar to the dressing box used by the noble lady, each layer was placed in a different color Gems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the legacy of the ancestor? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven’t visited this place for a long time," Jazz sighed. "Every time I see these magic stones, I think of the heavy past that my ancestors said." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Stone?" The film is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, only valuable items that witches can use," he nodded. "This is a very long story. Our family is built on one Under the blessing of the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father began to tell the history of the family, and the content of the childhood was different, the first Sir Silt was not from the West. It was after the desperate mountains, the uninhabited wild land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling gradually rounded his eyes, and he did not expect such an amazing secret behind the portrait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The founder of the family, the ancestors of Aisha, actually built a huge kingdom with many other witches. In the kingdom, they are in a dominant position, similar to the current aristocracy, and the death of the kingdom is due to the attack of the hell devil. In the last battle, the survivors fled, and Ai Gesha took a group of people to the stone pagoda in the forest to take the experimental materials, while the other group followed the big troops to the gray fort - the kingdom of the time It is still just a barren and desolate area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ancestral ancestors are in another group?" Philin asked in a dry throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he is the steward of the witch. It is reasonable to say that she should go to the forest with her, but he flinched and offered to stay to look after the supplies, and the witch promised His request." Jazz sighed, "You should know what it means."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill nodded, the butler can be regarded as a family apart from their loved ones. In addition, the owner is the most trusted person. In most cases, the housekeeper should die with the owner, unless the owner orders otherwise. Taking the initiative to ask to leave is in no way a betrayal, even if the other party does not refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After arriving in the West, the ancestors fell into deep regret and self-blame, and recorded all this emotion," Sir Sirte from another A black book was taken out of a box. "The witch finally failed to come back. After that, he broke off the association's connection, left the camp of the refugees, with a small number of servants, alone in this piece. The strip settled down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill took the black book and didn’t open it immediately, but thought of a terrible thing, "So, you Did you know from the beginning that everything the church did was wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the witch once committed to fighting the devil, why is it now being promoted as the devil's minion? ? There is obviously a great hidden feeling in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
