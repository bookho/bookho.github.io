			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall suddenly boiled up, the wooden table was smashed to the ground, the dishes containing the dishes were sizzling, and the soup ran down the slate gap. Get it everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sons sitting next to the duke are still seeing life and death so close for the first time. The larger Cole sword is in front of his father, but his posture is Stiff and incomprehensible, there was no leisurely training in the weekdays; and the 17-year-old Lance simply shrunk to the back of the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calvin sighed in secret, if there was no Itis, the two might not look so bad, but compared to the North Pearl, this gap They are too big to add, perhaps even they have already accepted their lives and lost the courage to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke looked to the center of the banquet hall, and the eldest daughter had already stared at Ed Hos, the strongest player on the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She first took a bottle of ale and yelled at each other, forcing him to turn around, then set off, jumped onto a long wooden table, and bowed to him Go, the quick action is like a snow cat. Ed rushed to block, and the blade was shot at the point where it fired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the numbers and interest, Isis has already slashed five or six swords, and the sounds of the jingle are in a series, like the footsteps of death, and Ai In the crisis, Germany has erupted an amazing momentum and completely resolved the attack. The two men struggled around the long table, and the swords of several Hors families had fallen nearby, but he not only did not retreat, but he became more and more brave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calvin couldn't help but worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis has had a big battle before, and the blood on the armor is proof that even if there is no injury, the physical strength will inevitably consume a lot, plus women The strength is inherently weak, so it is obviously unfavorable for her to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis can't see a trace of fear on her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes are fixed on the other side, the bright scorpion is like a flashing star, every time I can see the sweat of her hair. Despite the weakening of her strength, she still chose to suppress her opponent with an impenetrable attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aide seems to have noticed this too. He screamed and screamed at the threat of both defeats. The North Pearl is obviously not willing to exchange blood for blood. Withdraw the sword back. The power gap finally showed results, and Isis's long sword was shaken off, the body lost balance, and it fell from the long table! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke’s heart instantly mentioned the blind eye, “Damn! Go help her—”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;But even the nearest guards, it is difficult to lend a helping hand - everything happens too fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis was not as soon as possible after landing, but a flat cut cut off the long table legs, at this time Ed Hoss Jumping on the long table, his hands are raised high, and he wants to use a powerful sniper to attack the result of his opponent's life. He did not notice that the place where the former fell was just on the edge of the long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene of Calvin’s stunned appearance, the loss of the table for the Cavaliers completely lost balance – if it’s just a desktop overturn, he might be able to jump off easily But at that moment, his whole body's strength is concentrated on the arm, his feet are set on the table like a nail, and the body leans forward, which is the standard squat action! I saw that the whole person fell down in a dog-muddy posture, his head slammed into the floor, and the dull sound even he could hear it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no more opportunities for reversal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis jumped onto Eide’s back and pulled out the dagger from the waist, straight into Ed’s neck, and twisted with his hands. The knight's body twitched like a stroke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is... coincidence? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... The Duke realized that he had fallen into the trap under Itisb at the moment he jumped on the long table. From the beginning, he was captured by the opponent and hit the high point, so that he saw the hope of defeating the victory in his heart, and the advantage accumulated by the strength of the competition made him use the violent attack as the best way to win the game. - The opponent's weaker resistance has fueled Ed's confidence, so the final blow is to push the force to the limit. If you follow the normal competition, Itis will never block the blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
