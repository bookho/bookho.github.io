			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning turned over the "exploration supplies" that he carried with him and re-examined it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire, velvet, bandage, dagger, map, and a bag of dry food stuffed with beef pine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about you?" She looked at McMug. "Check it out too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "咕!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 put his hand into the bag - this cloth bag is usually hidden under her fluffy hair, it is difficult to see clearly inside After the stuff was stuffed, and after it became a bird, the clothes and the bag seemed to disappear from the air. Compared to her own flight, she is strictly limited by weight. It seems that McMug is not affected by this. The best proof is that she has produced more things than herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meat, meat, chicken legs, fillets, eggs, piled up in front of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God," she said, "We are going to explore, not to go barbecue in the wild, at least you have to bring weapons."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Mai Hao touched his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to say that your embarrassment is a weapon?" Lightning sighed. "If you encounter a trial force that looks like a can, you can open him." The armor is strange! Oh, forget it... Anyway, one day, there should be no danger. Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"喔!咕! "The other party suddenly turned into a pigeon, running two steps, flying on the ground for a while before slowly rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃, maybe the weight still has an impact on her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning pulled down the windproof glasses and flew gently before flying to her front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that when I first met Mai, I started an aerial pursuit in the woodland in the south, even though the fat pigeons did not escape their palms at that time. But at least it took a while to throw her down. Looking at it now, I am afraid I will be able to catch her in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can't be done, it's rare to have a flying partner, and she has to rely on her to carry the adventure tools in the future. The little girl thinks that she has to let her Have a good workout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕,咕?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning speed down, and along with the wheat," Speak up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to ask, where are we going to explore?" The pigeons mouthed together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The most western part of the forest, I want to see how big the forest is," Lightning pulled out the map and pointed to the blank space on the west side. By the way, this piece can be completed, and maybe you can see where the Chishui River comes from."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning from the fjord, she immediately started Set out to prepare for this expedition, and when you are free to practice, your Highness will not control where they fly. And the little girl has a secret in her heart that she didn't tell the other person - she has not dared to explore the forest alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a shame for an explorer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she couldn’t deceive herself. The stone pagoda made her fear of this deep forest. At the thought that those horrible monsters might be hidden somewhere in the forest, she couldn't help but want to escape as quickly as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, she is still the daughter of the greatest explorer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder has mentioned to her how to overcome fear, that is, to approach it a little bit, then observe it, understand it, and finally find out, "Fear It is not that terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was originally from the obstacles in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This expedition is an attempt at lightning. With the company, she has at least a little more confidence in her heart. The route chosen is also very safe. It goes westward along the Chishui River and does not go deep into the forest. It is unlikely that the devil will be encountered. When you fly over this route, try it next time. She believes that one day, she will draw a map of the entire West, and once again step into the stone tower to uncover the truth of the holy city of Taqila. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
