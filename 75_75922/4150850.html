			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults..." When Siassis saw the Lord of Scorpio again, he could hardly believe his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wet, as if it has just been fished out of the water, the spirit is extremely exhausted, the body is still wounded, and the armor is glued to the big piece. The blue blood is almost like a fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the parasitic eyeguards following Maharaja are not known. As the most sensitive alert, it can only play its due role when it is next to the Majesty. Today's situation can only show that the eye guards have suffered unexpectedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the other party is Tianhai, such a scene can be understood, but the opponent is obviously only those insects - humans only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod did not have the mood to explain it to him, grabbed his subordinates and dragged it into the door of distortion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, they have returned to the hustle and bustle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of the Scorpio, the soldiers on the island--" West Asia quickly reacted, and the face could not help but change, although the sudden explosion in the city made the vanguard The team suffered heavy losses, but some of them were spared. This walk is equivalent to discarding them all on Dagong Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a limited amount of life carried by the troops, I am afraid that it will not last for a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't open a new door anymore." Heckzod's words made the high-order psychic close his mouth, at any time, the original The value of the living body is far less than that of a Maharaja. It is not necessary to think about how to choose under the two evils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will escort you back to Tianzhu City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Notify Totolock first, Let humans use the sailboat to pick up the island's vanguard team, how much can be connected. As for the symbiosis, let them lurk on the spot." The Lord of Heaven gnaws his teeth, "When the gongs cover Dagong Island, the large forces will Immediately attack the Shenchi Bay and other places, the two of you are responsible for the war!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults... Will this be too urgent?" Surprised, "It’s not too late to attack after you have finished the injury--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my order, you don't need to say anything!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am overstepping," it quickly bowed his head, "as you wish!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the back of his subordinates, Heckzod took the only remaining hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn’t know if it’s a bit of hasty, but it’s better than letting humans drag it down – the Lord of Heaven’s first realize that time is not standing On their side, human beings are absorbed faster than they think. In one year, the other party can threaten a Maharaja by several witches and unmagic males. What will happen in a few years? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more breathing can be given to humans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West Line must be back on track! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Heckzod finally returned to the bottom of the Great Rift Valley. Nowadays, it has been filled with rich cockroaches. It is only here that you can feel the improvement of the spirit, and the tingling from the palm of your hand has been relieved a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It went straight to the Dianchi Lake at the bottom of the birth tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the still-moving nightmare of the monarch, the Lord of Scorpio is not angry at all, if it is not immersed in the conscious world, how can it be? Wolverine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything should not be like this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you focus on transferring troops, the speed of front-line advancement will not be so slow, and the other party will lead the team to fight, and those who are the fugitives will be one Can't run out of the North! Then, when the human beings are fearful, they launch a positive attack. At the same time, they lead the team from the west to the Hermes Plateau. This is the plan for the Western Route strategy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, the other party is the one that it can only look up to in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even... It was thought that the nightmare would become the king of the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no...Hecksod shakes his head, it is loyal to Wang Zhong, this is just an ignorant idea when attending the promotion ceremony, in terms of level, The nightmare is now essentially the same as it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At most... is a deeper understanding of the ideology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It made up its mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may hurt the memory of the nightmare, it may also make it thunderous, and even the clues of the upgraded mystery are interrupted, but that is not comparable to the western line. The war is important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big in the Holy See, it also stood on the side of the silence, admitting that it would be alright. As for where the piece of inheritance comes from, it can be put into research after the victory. As long as they can swallow the fragments of human inheritance, everything they have now will be turned into a further step for the community! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, Heckzod took a deep breath and slammed it into the nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic in the palm will interrupt its connection with the ideology and pull it out of the source of magic-<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a theoretical way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the nightmare did not open his eyes, its body poured to one side, like an empty shell, fell in the Dianchi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod suddenly felt the fear of holding his throat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it was almost destroyed by the uncontrollable magic in the promotion ceremony, or when it was ambushed by the Tianhai world, it was not so scared! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a step forward and raises the other side, trying to capture its consciousness, but only one is empty...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no severance of life, but it will always sleep. This is the characteristic that is lost in the conscious world--and once it is deep in the endless red sea, there is no possibility of coming back. Even if you can stay awake for a while, it will sooner or later be eroded by the rushing and messy consciousness until it becomes part of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the Lord of Heaven has suddenly fallen to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means they have lost their nightmare! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this happening? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of the ability of nightmares, as long as you act cautiously and do not make mistakes, you are not trapped by the consciousness community! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did it encounter when searching? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Heaven did not dare to think about it any more. It got up and rushed to the top of the tower, and even his own injuries were thrown into the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must tell the king immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation on the Western Front has changed dramatically! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "How is everyone's recovery?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cage station of the cage, the iron axe looked at Ai Gesha and asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is something to do with Nana Va." The latter put away the listening notes and smiled and shook his head. It can be seen that she is quite in a good mood. "According to Wendy's statement, McMug returned to the level of alive and kicking on the same day. Lightning waited until the next day to recover. Both of them have now resumed frontline patrols. The only regret is that I Did not participate in this ambush."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are taking risks after all... not to mention the giant musket, the Seagull has been seated I took it apart, let alone bring one more person.” The iron axe also showed a smile. “I thought that your regret would be that you could not kill the high-level devil in one fell swoop.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
