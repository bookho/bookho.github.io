			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has learned about the general situation of the 76th from the night, and he is actually interested in the dusty history, not to mention the Taji The Lama also claimed to have the intelligence of the gods, and now the other party can take the initiative to find the door, but also saved him a lot of effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in order to guard against accidents, in addition to the nightingale, Sylvie and the book, the office has more leaves and two pots of special potted plants. Once the latter's ability is applied, even if the field of stone is launched on the 76th, it is impossible to immediately eliminate the vines that are formed by the madness - as long as her footsteps are slightly stagnant, the nightingale can shoot the sifting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potted thing looks like the decoration, if there is no need to activate it, there is no threat, so Roland also avoided sending a guard to the room. The embarrassing scene surrounded by the group - you can't start to negotiate yet, let the other side look down on oneself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Wendy stepped into the office door on the 76th, Roland smiled and said, "Welcome to the Winter City, do you need tactical sunglasses?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people showed a silent expression, the nightingale turned his eyes, and slammed his shoulders in the fog. "Look, please don't talk nonsense at this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, okay..." Roland cleared his throat and changed back to the usual calm appearance. "So you are the 76th of Takira?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Felice, Dear King," the other hand raised his chest with one hand and bowed slightly. "Seventy-six is ​​nothing but disguised." The mortal code, since you have discovered my identity, the name has lost its meaning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chest is suitable for the upper class to see the royal family members, but also Ambassador to visit him When the usual salute, apparently Felice not know nothing about secular ritual. As for the disapproval and wording, the Roland was not in the heart. He valued the actual interests more than the verbal fame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sit down and talk," he nodded. "I have a lot of questions to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If I can answer it," Felice said with a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s probably not been a long time to talk to a “mortal” like him. Her expression is very blunt, probably because she wants to be polite and not Losing the pride they once ruled the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling Joel’s description of her, Roland couldn’t help but laugh a little. When dressed as a maid, it can be clearly and beautifully. Now it is changed back to formal status. Even if the witch empire has already fallen apart, it is determined to maintain that pride. I have to say that the name of Tacula is probably a part of her belief for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first thing is about your news. After all, if you want to work together against the devil, you have to know each other better." Roland drank a cup of tea. I asked, not too slowly, "To be honest, I have been very curious about how the Federation split into two factions. It is clear that everyone is a witch. Why do the churches have to chase after the same kind? Especially know the punishment After the military has a perfect form, this doubt is even stronger. Can you elaborate on the reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis probably didn’t expect him to I raised this question first, and after a moment of silence, I replied, "No one can predict what will happen in the end before entering the labyrinth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What do you mean, is it all related to the relics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without the relics, there will be no plans for the Prisoners, and the remaining witches will not be able to continue." ... but unfortunately we found it too late." She sighed when she said it. "In addition to finding a way to transfer the soul in the maze, the fugitives have found something else... Because of them, the Nataya talent and the Queen of Stars have disagreed and led to the final break." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Other...something?" Roland frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't tell you more at the moment, only after we find out the winners, we can talk in depth - by then, Pasha will personally Talk to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
