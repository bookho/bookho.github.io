			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, Roland also has a general plan for the security system in the future. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town currently has a population of 20,000 or so. In addition to the local aborigines, there are people from the Long Song Fortress and fugitives from the East. When the return of the messenger sent by Barov will bring a group of people from the south and the north of the kingdom, the demographic composition will be further complicated and the quality will be uneven. The conflicts like today will only increase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he also needs to establish a public security system to replace the current patrol work of the First Army - the separation of internal violence and external violence is sooner or later, before he I have also considered this issue, but I have lost it because of the shortage of people. Now the First Army needs to concentrate on fighting the evil spirits, and the population growth is also very fast, so the plan has already been implemented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a law for self-enactment, interpretation of the law, and trial of major criminal acts, the first trial is the final trial; the public security arrests the prisoners in accordance with the law, and deals with civil disputes. The Safety Bureau is responsible for maintaining the purity of each system, which can effectively prevent the corruption of power. At the same time, it can also use public security personnel to carry out cleaning operations and save human resources. This is the outline of the security system envisioned by Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal situation is that you can first test the security system in Bianbu Town, and then extend it to the entire West when you build the city in the coming year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time, whether it is autonomous territory of the nobility, it is necessary to implement the same set of laws and accept the control of the unified department. Only one person can be above the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows that he is the largest aristocrat in the West, so he can neither say that everyone is equal before the law, nor can he abolish the aristocratic system. But at least he can let his city have no traditional aristocrats in the sense of the land. If you want to accept the protection of the West, you must surrender your autonomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the supervisor of the public security department, Roland has already considered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Knight, Carter Lannis, who has a sense of justice and acts without pedantry, is a good choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When Vader returned to his temporary residence, the old man Kukasim immediately greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately," he muttered. It was the tenth whistle that was sent by His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me see," Kukasim eagerly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you go back to the house," Vader walked into the house, and the warmth of the breath quickly dispelled the chill of the whole body, closing the door, and the inside and outside seemed to be two worlds. general. Compared to the wooden sheds that were leaky and leaky in the past, this seemingly low and narrow mud house is more comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, the locals seem to call this house a cave dwelling? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man let him squat on the fire, and opened the clothes behind him, could not help but suck a cold breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is blood behind you, I will get some gray to sprinkle you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't, don't. It's just the blood left behind when you are punished. The blood has stopped." He stopped the sound. "The Cavaliers said that it would be like this, just two or three days, the wound will be Healing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two or three days?" Kukasim shook his head in dismay. "No, child, you may get caught in a high fever, and you will be swollen behind." In a group. Even if you are strong, you will have at least a week to recover. You should be clearer than me in the case of a bad attack."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may not Believe," he licked some dry lips. "I didn't feel the pain behind the wound. On the contrary, there was a feeling of coolness and itching. This is a sign of healing. After the whip is finished, they go. I poured a bucket of water behind me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Salt?" The old man frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pathogenic micro...what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Microorganism," he grinned. "Ghosts know what it is, probably related to witches." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man hangs his head, and after a long time he sinks his voice: "You shouldn’t be for me, just bear it..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""If you are forbearing, you will be treated with intensification. I know what kind of virtue the guy is, or that most of the nobles look like one," Vader spit, "I heard." snow here is what is good for months, the two of us together are much less support at that time. "he paused." and ...... I deliberately picked that time to beat him. "<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, intentional?" Kukasim stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because this time every day, the Prince will appear in the Western Wall. Since he promised free food, he will definitely hate this kind of corruption." It is also the most effective method. If it is just a simple fight, it may not be passed into the ears of His Royal Highness. After all, Koya Harvey may be instructed, and the officials of the City Hall want to suppress the news. We say nothing is useless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But he may also be instructed by the Lord's adult..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The possibility is extremely low. If you want to save this money, you can directly reduce the three meals to two meals. And I have inquired beforehand, whether it is the local residents or the serfs, they are all against the Highness. Mercy and sage are full of praise." He smiled smugly. "Look, I am not gambling wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original...so," I breathed a sigh of relief. "You see it is really thorough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb Sp; but he also has no guessing part, Vader thinks, that is the penalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a patrol player who has served in Jin Suicheng for more than ten years, he has a deep enough understanding of the ugliness of the city’s glamorous appearance. The aristocrat who extorted, he has seen no fight, even inside the patrol. Therefore, it is not difficult for him to want to rectify these nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince’s reaction was basically as he thought, but the penalty was to make Wade unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, most of the lords who like the reputation will be acquitted by the oppressor, but he has punished everyone - compared to fame, His Royal Highness seems to care more about the system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a rare quality for a lord who is accustomed to what he wants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do next?" The old man said after a moment of silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Two days off - the Cavaliers are exceptional, then continue to do some groceries for those who are carrying strange weapons."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You could have lived in the inner city and lived with the craftsmen's decent life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can't get in, Kukasim, don't say this anymore," he shook his head. "I won't leave you outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This name The old man was neither his family nor his elders. Six months ago, the other was a prisoner held in jail. Everyone knows that the old man was only used by the Black Street Mouse to launch the top tank, but this kind of thing is much more, the patrol is too lazy to pay attention. Later, Jin Suicheng was looted by a large group of pirates. He had to die in this turmoil, but he was hidden in the cell by the old man at the critical juncture. He covered his body shape with stinky sheets and eventually escaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wade did not expect that he would be saved by a prisoner who was not willing to take a look at it, and suddenly realized that he was disgusting with those There is no essential difference between the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two people in the room know the identity of Kukasim. They look good when they are there. Once they are gone, they will definitely find trouble for the elderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, everything will be fine." Vader patted each other's shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
