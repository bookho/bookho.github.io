			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bianbian Town West, Chishui River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow made the carriage difficult, and the party took half a day to haul the first field gun to the outside of the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this time?" Carter felt a little accustomed to the new things that the prince was constantly making. "A magnified musket?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost." Roland commanded the man to remove the hook and personally adjust the angle of the gun to level the gun body and the poles into the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of artillery and musket is exactly the same, so it is very appropriate to say that it is an enlarged version of the musket. The gun fired a 12-pound solid iron ball. The shells and gunpowder were pre-loaded into the raft and the wires were ignited. Roland refers to the mature designs in history and refers to the carpenter's creation of a wooden gun mount. In order to improve the durability, the parts which are more rubbed with the ground and which are subjected to the force at the time of launch are covered with iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make the gun mount and the wheel, Roland spent almost the same amount of time as the drill, and the three carpenters were busy for a week before they finished, especially the diameter For the half-man high wheel, the carpenter first shaved four lengths of square wood strips. After soaking, they were fired to bend with fire, the ends were cut out and the grooves were spliced, and the outer edge of the wheel was covered with iron. This set of processes took four days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the eyes of Roland, this hand-crafted, limited-edition 12-pound field gun has a dazzling glow. When I pulled out the test, the lineup was very large. The chief knight and the militia commanded the iron axe. The guards and the knight apprentices all went into battle. The militia team also transferred 20 people to clear the venue and guard. . In addition, he also brought nightingales and lightning for the first time. Tonana's blessing, the militia's prejudice against the witch group was reduced to a minimum, and Nanawa himself became the second-best prince in the ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do it according to the process, first clean up the cannon." Although Roland is very clear about the structure of the artillery, the specific operation is blank. He racked his brains to recall the guns in various medieval movies, trying to sort out a set of processes. As for the actual effect, it is true that God knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning is so high that a mop-style cleaning rod is pulled from under the gun mount and breaks into the muzzle - unlike other witches, the lightning is raised as long as She can handle all kinds of novel inventions by hand, she is willing to work for Roland, and there is no need to pay. In the face of this kind of money-saving conditions, Roland naturally agreed to it. Anyway, when it is the turn of confidentiality, it is enough to secretly study. There are still many ideas and inventions in his mind waiting to be realized, and it is enough for her to take a few pieces for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few times, the mop did not bring out any clutter, but according to the process, she had to carry out a second cleanup. Replace it with another mop and pump it a few more times. The cannon cleaning is complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you understand?" Roland asked the knights and militiamen who were watching. This test is also a drill. Now the production of firearms has increased dramatically. The militia team is bound to evolve into formal infantry. Wood guns will also be replaced by guns and artillery. This requires a lot of shooting training to be able to skillfully operate these two hot weapons on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing everyone nod, he let lightning go on the next step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl took out a bag of paper-wrapped gunpowder, stuffed it into the cannon, and smashed it with a wooden pole. Then put in the shells and tighten them again. The drill rod is taken out from the lead eye at the rear end of the barrel, the medicine bag is broken, and then the lead wire is inserted, so that the preparation for the launch is completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent accidents, everyone exits the fifteen steps, lightning brings the torch closer to the lead, and the sparks in the end are shining, and the gun has been drilled in the blink of an eye. In the tube. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a loud bang -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-speed jet of air at the muzzle will carry snow From the ground, a layer of snow fog was raised on the ground. The theoretical effective range of the 12-pound gun can reach more than a kilometer. Even if there is no squall line, the trajectory of the front-stage projectile is still in a straight line. The armor target placed about a hundred meters away made a sound, was hit by a twelve-pound iron ball, and the whole flew up. The iron ball is not declining, and it bounces continuously after falling on the snow, causing a column of snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the smoke was exhausted, Carter and Iron Axe ran to the target for the first time. I saw that the front of the armor had been completely sunken. The front deck was attached to the rear deck. A large palm hole was located in the center of the armor. Obviously, the shell flew forward about 100 meters after it penetrated the target. Even when it falls on the ground, it has amazing power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
