			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axe knows that he is being supervised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunters who participated in the test explosion on that day were concentrated in a two-story building near the castle. Looking out through the window, you can see a circle of stone walls, guards guarded at the entrance and exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not care about this. He even felt that his Highness sent only two guards to serve as guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, the iron axe still has the roar of the test explosion that day - no weapon can bring him such a strong shock. In the far south, he saw the orange fire erupting from the ground, and he could continue to burn for decades; he also saw the wind and the waves that covered the sky in the endless cape... However, Tianwei is unmeasurable, it is the earth. The mother or the sea god's will is the iron whip that the gods use to punish all creatures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince of the prince, however, personally steals the authority of the three gods and gains the power of heavenly punishment - even though compared with the real heavenly thunder There is still a long way to go, but that is not the realm that manpower can achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the participants in Tieshan City are still useful, they will usually be cut off their tongues. Of course, this is not the safest practice. Only the dead will keep the secret. As for foreigners? They look at each other at a glance, and it is never possible for foreigners to join the core class of the Mokins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince knew that he had half of the interracial ancestry, still allowed him to witness the fire of the day, and also planned to let him be responsible for the formation of the Orion. This kind of trust makes the blood of the iron axe surge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tieshacheng, he experienced countless betrayal and framed, fled to the south of the gray fort, and the bloodline of the people of the sand and the mainland also made him suffer. After doing all the discrimination, he finally came to Bianbu Town with disappointment. He planned to spend the rest of his life by hunting. He did not expect to be favored by His Royal Highness here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no doubt that with this new weapon, it is inevitable that he will win the title of King Roan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the opportunity to live for the future king, the iron axe is excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone, downstairs collection!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe hears the sound, the probe looks It was discovered that the comer was the chief knight of the Four Princes, Carter Lannis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He arranged his dress for the first time, stepped downstairs and walked to Carter and stood upright. He also participated in the training of the militia team, knowing that His Royal Highness is well-disciplined and uniform. Other hunters were much slower, and it took the six people to wait for about a quarter of an hour before they lined up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Old place, let me go," Carter didn't care much, took a group of people out of the door and went straight outside the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is still the location of the last test, but this time did not pull up the cordon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to Roland, there are four knights - they are all Carter's men. The iron axe noticed that the prince had a fancy metal stick in his hand and explained something to the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the Iron Axe and his party, Roland greeted him. "How are you still living in a new place?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your concern," everyone said, and they all said that the new home is very comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the newly moved residence is much better than the old ones before, the iron axe thinks, at least not leaking wind and rain, the roof is not light straw Covered, but neatly tiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is fine," Roland nodded. "The current arrangement is for security reasons. You can move back to live until the end of the demon month. In addition, the first month's salary has been paid to your family, and you can meet with them every weekend. Of course, accompanied by the guards."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your kindness, Your Highness." The hunters said cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This really makes the iron axe somewhat unexpected, and the iron law of the sand people is not to be said, even the management of the gray fort army should not be so lax. Could it be that this is because of the personal tolerance of His Royal Highness? He is faintly worried. If he wants to compete for the throne, he must be ruthless. At this point, he sees too much in Tiesha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
