			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ship is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light gray sea antenna has a sail at the end. There are no other merchant ships here, so only the ships from the sleeping islands can be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Tilly sighed softly, mixing the sounds of the sea and the shoal of the shoal, which seemed to be nothing. Roland couldn't see her expression because she was facing her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Going away," Andrea's tone is quite a bit regrettable. "I like your territory very much, and I don't know how to get back to the island." After that, can I make a delicious ice cream bread like this one.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to a well-prepared bolting rifle, Roland will also formulate ice cream. And gave it to her, "As long as there are eggs and milk, the taste will not be bad. When you visit the town next time... No, there will be better food here when there is no winter city." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it better than ice cream?" Andrea said with a fluttering blond hair, "The lord can't lie, you remember what I said." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to be so reluctant, just stay here," Ashes said, "His Royal Highness will not mind that one less can be around. The guy who eats - Sleeping Island can't make you open your belly to eat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, is it? After you go back, the ice cream is not you. "Oh," Andrea gave her a look. "You will give me salted fish every day and drink squid soup."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people Between the routines, the sailboat gradually approaches the coast, and the pink flag fluttering from the top of the mast shows that the comer is the beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yelva summons an invisible barrier to and from the shoal and the sailboat, carrying the books and supplies to the fjord a little bit. In the end, the card-playing trio and the five-god were transported. Just as Tilly stepped onto the barrier, Roland stopped her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What's wrong?" She turned her head back and there were some complicated emotions in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this occasion, Roland is not good at it, calling her name is only subconscious, and finally he took a deep breath and sighed, "If If you have any problems with the sleeping island, you can always tell me, I will find a way to help you solve it. In addition, no winter city will always welcome you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "..." Tilly took a moment to show a shallow smile. "Thank you, you too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goodbye, everyone." Andre Ya and Sawyer waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes did not speak, but they waved with the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After bidding farewell to the witches, the barrier carries four people and quickly slips to the beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong, reluctant?" The sound of the nightingale came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a little pity, more than 300 witches... If you can move to the West, how good it is," Roland said with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, then your sin is even deeper," the night glanced at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah...sin?" Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is life here better than Sleeping Island?" Anna was also puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't understand it," she turned and walked straight toward the hot air balloon. "This is the most irritating."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the back of the other person, Roland sighed and disappeared two days later, the nightingale seemed to return to the previous state, which made him finally relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go back, there are still a lot of things to do," Wendy laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well," Roland and Anna smiled and held each other's hands together and walked toward the lookout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
