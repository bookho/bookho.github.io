			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olympic number itself is not important, what is important is the sign that it represents - in the initial exploration of dreams, he has determined that the books he has not read are all Blank, whether it is a small book stall or a library, most books have only one cover. He even guessed that these covers all came from a certain corner of the memory. If they had never seen it before, even the book itself would not exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Olympus textbook on the table of Jieluo overturned his conclusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didn’t you find the same at first? Is there a omission in the exploration of the first two or three months, or is this change happening afterwards? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s the latter, it’s worth it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Olympics can be born out of nothing, then gradually recover, then other books, or everything that he has not seen before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting weird power, destroying the demon, and liberating the power of nature... What is the connection between them, will it be the cause of the world change? It is a question that Roland is eager to find an answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"陛下?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the nightingale suddenly interrupted his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland bowed his head and found that his hands did not know when it was pressed on her instep, unconsciously rubbing back and forth - through thin socks, He can clearly feel the smooth skin and slender toes of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I changed the new one, there is no way to clean the body on the boat," the nightingale was a little bit embarrassed. "I am afraid it is still a bit dirty... or else, I will first Going to wash?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was a big sensation, clearly thinking about some very important questions, why would you make this move subconsciously? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, what does it mean to wash first? I didn't mean to do this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as I didn’t know how to explain it, the office door was suddenly ringed, helping him to ease the atmosphere. After the night fell into the fog, he cleared his throat and began to open his mouth. "Come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the office is Ai Gesha, she is simple. After the ceremony, "The samples from Daxueshan have all been transferred to the third side of the city. Would you like to have a look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pretended to think After a while, I waited until my heart and mind nodded. "Of course, go now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Ai Gesha answered, she went to the door when she went to the door. Going back, "Do you feel uncomfortable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you ask?" He gave a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your voice is a little different, this is a sign of infection," Ai Gesha said seriously. "Although the evil moon has passed, it is the coldest when it melts snow." The disease is very easy to invade the body. You are not a witch. You should always remember to protect your body. Even if you are not for yourself, you have to consider it for all human beings. Do you understand? I have not yet set off, I will call Lily to check it out. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this inspection will not take long, Roland laughs and laughs. After completing a bottle of Lily's special "explosive water", under the heavy protection of the guards and witches, they entered the underground of the desolate mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tacila survivors who came to meet him gave him a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Pasha and Elsie, several other people are familiar with the "dream comer" - "Seventy-six" Felice, " "The worm nest" Falti, "no light curtain" and "shadow walker" spirit. Although in addition to Felice, the other people are also showing the appearance of male gods, but they are always people who have enjoyed the dream world, and their eyes are much more peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you want to raise those bugs of unknown origin in our main hall, but also plan to try to domesticate them?" "The mortal king, I have to admit that you are daring, and that the researcher is not inferior to the savvy Quest, but this curiosity is also likely to destroy you - you know, it is left by the deep sea enemies. Species!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
