			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe closes his eyes and can feel the taste surrounded by yellow sand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fourth day he entered the desert, and the third week when the First Army left the Winter City. At the end of the week, two-thirds of the winter will be completed and the coldest winter will be reached. However, compared to the gray-streaked west of the sky, it is much less affected by the evil moon. Although the sky has always shown a repressed gray, at least it has no bitter north wind and enough to freeze the whole. Snow and ice in the desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Yinchuan does not converge with any river, and most of the water flows through the ground, the army can only walk on foot. The iron axe did not follow the original plan, waiting for the 500 recruits stationed in the broken cliff city to prepare for the march, and then mixed them into a unified action of the big forces. Instead, they threw those people to Brian, and they took the first step and strived for an early rush. To Tiesha City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recruits may be standing in place to pull the trigger, and the continuous trekking march will only make them bury themselves in the sand. And even if these five hundred people are added, it will not help the situation much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew in his heart that to achieve his goal, he could not rely on the artillery to attack. The first army was to ensure the fruits of the victory, not to conquer the sand people. means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mojin people have a traditional solution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the five hundred recruits, as long as they do a good job of grabbing the Yinchuan oasis and ensuring that the front troops are not being attacked by people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the extreme south, the oasis means the lifeline, whether it is offensive or fleeing, it is inseparable from the supply of oasis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of veteran marching veterans, even if they have not seen the power of the musket, the tribal people can feel the power they radiate. No one stood up on the way to question the army from the Grey Fort. Only when the water tank was filled and the food was refilled, the sand people would whisper behind the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this rate, before the night, the First Army should be able to reach the Iron Sands City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't quite understand, the so-called sacred duel, can you start any time in any season, any time?" A woman with a pretty blonde walked Echoes around her, her white skin and the Aosha clan princess formed a stark contrast. "Even if it is an honor challenge between the nobility, it is allowed to refuse. After all, everyone has a bad state. Like this cold weather, everyone I want to sleep in the warm fire for a whole day instead of coming out to fight and kill? I mean... what if someone doesn't agree with the holy duel?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Axe remembers that she is called Andrea, a fighting witch who often follows her next to Tilly. According to His Majesty, the original foreign aid will only have one person who is ashamed, but somehow, she eventually Also followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When someone picks up an axe and rushes into your home and kicks your stove, it doesn't matter if you don't want to kill it." "Do you think that this kind of competition that determines a family's life and death will follow a set of hypocritical rules between the nobles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The name is a sneak attack or Slaughter, not a duel," Andrea dismissed. "Even if the Mokins are barbarians, it is not even impossible to distinguish this. Do you think anyone like you is not learning?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In response to this, you are really a talented person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't misinterpret I mean!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe did not care about the barbarians, Bianbu Town did not ask the origin, this is what his Majesty said to him. He has a more important identity than the Mo Jin people, and that is no winter city residents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t cough twice until he responded to him, and he explained, “Miss Andrea’s worry is not a concern. Although the sacred duel cannot be rejected, and must be approved by the three gods when both parties are ready, the duel is not initiated by the initiator. First, the challenger must have a duel qualification."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of qualification?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
