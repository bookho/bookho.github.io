			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the sleeping area of ​​the sleeping spell, the ashes just closed the door, and there was a coughing sound from Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, Roland said, you should understand what it means?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She couldn't help but raise her mouth and deliberately replied in a sigh of tone. "Isn't it literally... I am following the leaves, like taking care of a patient. Her body is hurt, and there will always be a lot of inconvenience -" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the ash finally couldn’t help but smile and leaked it from the corner of his mouth. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are cheating on me--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, I know I should do it What.” She turned and rubbed her eyes. “Your Majesty just wants to take advantage of the unique perception of magical fluctuations by the extraordinary, and warn the leaves ahead of time—just like my encounter with you.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don’t have this ability, you won’t see me in the crowd with bloody hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not the devil." Tilly embraced her chest with both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Just give an example," Ashes surrendered. "After all, I only played with the Demon, isn't it?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the warning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it is to move closer to the reinforcements and defeat the enemy together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not a mad flame three princess, seeing what opponents want to go up and challenge Ashes laughed. "As long as the magic is not blocked, the leaves can cross the entire forest in an instant. It doesn't make sense to stay in the same place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call..." Tilly vomited, "Don't forget what you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is natural," she walked to the other side, straight Regarding the eyes of the five kings, "I have to accompany you for a long time. The Andrea, the guy who grew up in a noble family, didn't know how to take care of people. I thought I could play it. How can I give you to her." ”<br /><br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say, say, fool!" Tilly glanced at her and walked toward the room without any fuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she got to the door, she suddenly stopped and whispered, "You can save the leaves, I... actually feel very happy."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray is slightly different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you just protect me, it is a waste of your ability." Tilly turned back. "Although you always said that I am the most sleepy island." A safe choice, but in fact you like it too, isn't it right? Now your smile is much more than before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes... is this the case? She couldn't help but touch her cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you are sleeping on the island, you rarely laugh, always have a face, just like waiting for the enemy to kill at all times. Tilly went on, "I'm afraid you didn't even notice that the new witch is very afraid of you, and only the simple girl of McMug can make a mess with you."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now, you not only get along well with the Witch Alliance, I heard that there are admirers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What you said is...Luo Jia? No, she is just familiar with me, probably because of the relationship often discussed..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok," Tilly interrupted. "I like to see what you are now than the "Avengers" of the past. but! "She paused. "It doesn't mean you can do whatever you want, be reluctant, understand?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a silence in the meeting, and the ashes came back. "I know." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Is there any progress in the Air Knight program?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland said that he is trying to combine a new power source with a glider. If successful, he can create a batch. There is no need for Wendy to fly freely." Tilly said with great enthusiasm, "But the first thing I have to do is to build a special machine for me. It is said to fly higher and faster than the beast." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under your knees will not let you go to the battlefield, and... I have already agreed with him, the gray smiled and did not say these words. "When I wait for the test flight, I will go see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. Then I took a shower and steered the seagull all day, behind Slimy...waiting to meet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you wash it together?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I don't think about it!" Tilly slammed the door and said it closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes sat down on the bench in the living room and looked at his palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last blow to the devil, the sense of touch is still fresh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, she seemed to step into a new field, even if only one second, it was enough to make a deep impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is vision, movement, or reaction, it seems to be separated from the surrounding world, leaving only the magic to accompany it. Too strong a magical torrent of burning her, also brought her unparalleled power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ember even felt that the force was responding to her call and was tempting her to go further. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The magic affects not only our body, but also our temperament... If we are eager to use magic to achieve a certain purpose, it will us Guide in that direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you...who is fighting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the first expedition was wild, the words that the goddess Felice said had echoed in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you telling me this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because you are a superb, born Have unimaginable potential. But to truly cross the hurdle, you must have a realistic goal and a strong will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a record in the federation All of them are ushered in in the battle, and those who fail to cross this hurdle are all falling under the devil. I hope that you can become the former."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Extraordinary...the three seats of the federation have faced the same choice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash clenched the palm... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She now knows the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland returned to the office and filed a telephone call to the General Office of the Executive Office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take Barov."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the general manager came from the receiver. "What is your command?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" When is the primary education assessment held?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I look up...A week after the plan, the reference number is expected to be 2,650. People."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the time is almost just right, Roland has figured out in his heart, "To be a employer, I need to transfer a batch to implement the new project. About five hundred people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now no winter city is like It is a huge melting pot, and people from all over the kingdom are put into it. After completing the primary education, they are immediately assigned to various jobs. On the production line, a large number of experienced producers can accept these newly-entered newcomers without any difficulty. After the manual small workshop mode was broken, the technology changed from a private experience to a craft system, and it became a matter of course to take the old belt. And a large number of newcomers become skilled workers, and can further expand the scale of production and swallow more followers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
