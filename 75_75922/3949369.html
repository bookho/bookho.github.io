She picked up a piece and sniffed it on her nose, and she could indeed smell the rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, it's hard to imagine a sticky paste before it was made. In order to make it full of fragrance, the temple also added perfume to it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei subconsciously aimed at the price on the eye paper, the price of twenty-five silver wolves is considered a luxury, but more Expensive perfume, this price is obviously too low. "Are you sure you are adding perfume? When I was performing at Wang Du, I had a big aristocrat who gave me three bottles. Each bottle has only the size of a thumb, but the price is Five gold dragons or more. If you have such a large soap, you have to add at least half a bottle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" Carter licked, "Perfume "It's so expensive?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," Mayi gave him a look. "That is one of the most desirable products of the Wangdu Alchemy Association, except for crystal glass." It is the best selling perfume. Listening to people, in addition to the tribute to the royal family, the perfume that can flow to the market every year is nearly a thousand bottles. Can afford People of all kinds are upper-level aristocrats and wealthy businessmen. If it is not given, I will never take a few theater remunerations to buy a bottle of perfume."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "But I don't see any rare materials when I make my perfume under the Highness... Listen to him, it seems to be made of sugar cane?" Carter saw Mei Yi's incomprehensible look added, "Sugar cane is a sweet stick." A crop from the fjord, which looks like a stick, bites up with sweet water. At present, only the backyard of the castle is being planted. Next time I ask my Highness to see if I can bring it out."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the prince of the prince... After Mey came to the town, the most heard was the name Roland Wimbledon. Whether it is Irene or Carter, he always mentions him when he talks about the changes in the town. It seems that His Highness is omniscient and omniscient, and all this novelty is created by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are really people who are so knowledgeable in the world? She doubts that even if she is smart, it takes time to learn new knowledge. Whether it is the king or the long song fortress, the recognized scholars are all white people. The folks in the West have even a common saying: the longer the beard, the wider the knowledge. The prince himself is only in his twenties. How could he know so much? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my heart, Mei’s face still looks as usual. “No, if it can be used to make perfume, it must be a very rare crop. Especially the perfume formula, This can be sold at any alchemy square. You should never inquire into your Highness. If you see it, you should never say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Carter screamed and pulled out a handkerchief and wrapped four pieces of soap into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to buy so much?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A person can buy up to two, we pretend to separate Buy it, give it to you after you go out - don't disagree," the Cavaliers reached out to stop what Mey wanted to say. "If I run out, I can apply to my Highness. If I sell it here, I don't know when I will have new goods." You can take these four pieces for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei looked at each other’s serious eyes, and it seemed to be burned by something. . For a long time...? She licked her lips and stopped making sounds, silently watching the Cavaliers wrap the soap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is here, look at other products," he said, picking up the cloth bag and laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the "home" of Bianbu Town, the window is already dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset glowed through the window and stained the interior of the room with a touch of orange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since staying here to perform the follow-up drama, Mey also got a room like Irene. Although not big, it is complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She placed the novelty items she bought from the convenience store on the table, in addition to the four pieces of soap, there is a bottle of wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bottle of wine is different from the common ale and wine in the pub. It has almost no color, pure and transparent, and it is no different from water. I remember that the product description says that this is called white wine. The concentration is high and it is not advisable to drink more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
