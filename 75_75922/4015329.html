			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Whirlpool, the Fiordland Islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea has raised a fog, and the ship is like walking in the clouds, and it is white and white. It was not long before the people of the line left Xuelang Island. At this time, the island had disappeared without a trace, as if it had never existed before. In addition to the sound of boiling water and the bottom of the boat, Margaret realized that they were still moving forward and could not find other objects that could be oriented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fog in the sea is a taboo for the crew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If other captains ask for this, they have been tied up by the sailors and thrown into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the captain of the chase is the Thunder, the most famous explorer in the fjord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it is the place he wants to go, there will be someone willing to follow, even if the front is the entrance to the bottomless abyss, or the depths of the live fire lava. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The front is the reef area, adults!" the sailor familiar with the place shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sail down, slow forward," Thunder clap his hands. "Everyone is staring around, erecting their ears, where is our destination!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" everyone sang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the secret meeting between the Grey King and the Roland, and the support, the Thunder did not delay a day, immediately set out to prepare for the third time to the east of the Shadow Islands Explore the secrets of the sea line and the tides. In addition to preparing for boats and recruiting excellent explorers, the most crucial step is to find witches who can go deep into the sea to observe the ebb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Margaret’s partner, Kwai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you find her?" Morrier stood on the top of the magic servant's head and looked at it. "I can't see anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When she can't see it, she will show up," Margaret whispered. "Kwai will not sit idly by on a dangerous sailboat." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has now become a fish?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last time I saw When she was, only her legs became the shape of a fish, but that was already more than a decade ago," Margaret shook her head. "I don't know what it is now."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a summoning ability, so it is not surprising to become any aquatic animal," said Kamila Darius, the big butler of Sleeping Island. "If you say the sunflower If I have been with the sea, I don’t have to worry that she can’t get through the awakening day. But after more than ten years, is she really still in this sea area?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Ms., you want to Believe in our intelligence," Thunder laughed. "Since I knew she was a witch, I have been paying attention to the movements of this place. I want to know that her singing is a sign of Snowy Island. There are even some businessmen who are eager to move. The voice is for yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You blocked them?" Camilla browed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A shipwreck stopped them," Thunder blinked. "I promise that those guys will never dare to beat her."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that...thank you for your help to the witch," she said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Uncle!" Moryl followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hahaha, do I look so old?" Thunder touched the beard. "It's not that long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margaret shook his head in the side, this guy, still so easy to please women, no matter which island in the fjord, he is the most eye-catching existence. Of course, if it is not, then I will not fall in love with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, since he had lightning, he never had any plans to marry others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, I seem to hear the song!" suddenly shouted at the stern, "just in the northwest!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the crowd listened, the voice of the ethereal voice gradually became clear. It did not come from all directions, but was firmly pointed in one direction - just like the light in the dense fog, guiding the chase to the safe route. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Receive the sail, anchor!" Thunder instructed, "Put the landing shuttle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Awakening as a witch, probably knowing that he can't be caught by others, the sunflower almost never shows up, the ship in distress can only hear the song, and few people have seen her true body. Therefore, the Thunder’s plan was to stop the chase in the same place and continue to attract the singer. He and Margaret and the witches found her by boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic servant sneaked into the water and sneaked forward against the landing shuttle, and the process of paddling was omitted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After driving for about a quarter of an hour in the thick fog, Margaret suddenly saw a green figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kwai!" She couldn't help but yell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song screamed abruptly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a woman who was half floating on the water, and the people who looked at the boat with surprise, seemed to be overwhelmed. Her hair was pulled down like a fluffy seaweed, revealing only half of her cheeks and round eyes. The skin is white without a trace of blood, and scaly markings can be seen on the cheeks and neck edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's me, Margaret! Do you remember me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"吖—吖——Dumb--” She made intermittent calls and slowly retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s useless, she can’t talk anymore," Thunder decisively said. "The next communication is handed over to you, Ms. Camilla." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carmela nodded and put his hand on Margaret's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the sound of Kwai sounded in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are... take them to catch me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I came to you for--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the heart, she can hear," Camilla interrupted. "From the heart of the exchange." More sincere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Margaret swallowed, sinking, thinking about what he was going to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have saved my life, Kwai, do you remember? I am here to seek your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, she heard the other person’s response again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I remember you, Margaret, we used to be together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is The power of the witch! It was amazing... Margaret thought excitedly, but fortunately, before the trip, the Thunder foreseen this, and from the sleepy curse, came out with the help of Camilla. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carmela Darry? Who is she?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oops, forgot now The mind can be heard directly by the other party. Margaret quickly gathers her mind and then “speaks”. “Carmela Derry is the one who can let us hear the voice. She is also a witch like you.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sailors will not catch witches?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course! The church's power has been completely destroyed Now, the witch is still settled in the fjord. The sleeping island is a town built by a witch. If you want to go, I can help you guide the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Oh?" The voice of Kwai looked very excited. "What happened recently? Someone used to throw me with a harpoon. I thought they came for the church to enjoy the prize."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things will not happen again, Thunder adults have solved everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
