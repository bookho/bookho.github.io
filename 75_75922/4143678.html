			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that the baron of Shenchiwan has been very quick to move, not only to separate half of the room of the Governor’s Office for military command, but also to mobilize a group of maids. Serving everyone, it can be said that it is quite comprehensive. However, the iron axe refused to leak the door on the grounds of preventing leaks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the young people in the staff team who showed their disappointment, he said with no expression. "It’s time to work, let's move. Don't forget. Your performance will be recorded and reviewed by Isis Kant. If there is a flaw, you should know the consequences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mention of Northland Pearl The name, everyone in the fight, and immediately spread out busy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Map, I am going to hang the map!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the itinerary? I will check it again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is going to pick up the amount of rations prepared for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room suddenly changes It’s so lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a young man, it’s really energetic..." Remy shook his head with a smile. "The baron’s eyesight is good, I’m afraid I’ve seen the bottom of these people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The customary means of the nobility," the iron axe frowned. "But he can also spend the same amount of thought on the migratory action." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, in this regard, our Executive Office will follow up and supervise." Remy patted his chest. "In short, the first springboard will be taken smoothly." Now, the process can be said to be smoother than I expected. In a sense, the fangs and the Red Stone Gate family are equivalent to helping us, but then it may not be so easy..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there is no difference." The iron axe interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes... is it?" The latter stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because they have fallen behind this era." He stopped talking after he finished, but turned his eyes to the window, the rain cloud is now scattered, gloomy A small piece of azure appeared in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because they are already behind this era." One week before departure, Isis said this to him - but this time it was not privately. Instead, he was directly invited to the office of the General Staff Department and the meeting recorder was arranged. The topic of discussion is how to effectively complete the population migration plan. "I don't realize the change of the outside world. All eyes are on the wealth at hand. I have no imagination. I am good at calculating the gains and losses." Most aristocrats are like this. If I didn't guess wrong, you plan to hit them one by one, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If they are obstructing their plans." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too slow." Itis bluntly said, "This action is different from the Battle of the Grey Fortress. Unfamiliar territory needs to be stationed to ensure the migration route." Unimpeded, the soldiers who can be used will be continuously diluted, even if the final victory is undoubted, the time of the entire plan will be greatly lengthened. Second, the power of the gray castle may make them afraid to confront each other, and the plan behind it may not necessarily Immediately exposed, until they cause substantial damage, you will act blindly and undermine the majesty of your majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "Set goals in advance, pull one party to play one." Itis handed over a form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above list is full of options, followed by a +1+2 score. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Iron Axe was the first to see such a special form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Threat Assessment Form? Rebel Classification Manual?... In short, it is not important. This is what I wrote according to the aristocratic psychology. The reference conditions include gender, heir, The size of the territory, the number of troops, daily routines, etc. You can get a rough result by filling in the information in the box. The more information available, the more natural it is for judgment, because the situation of the wolf heart and the winter is already big. Change, so this part of the General Staff Department can not complete for you, if you do not have the list, you can calculate according to the table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Below fifty, you can draw together. Their strength is average and their ambitions are limited. But these nobles can do a lot of things. The local map information, town distribution, and population details can be learned from their mouths. And more What's important is that with the support of local lords, the migration can reach the highest efficiency,” explains Itis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for more than fifty..." she paused. "It can be seen as having no negotiation value, or not worth wasting time on them." Regardless of whether the other party has shown surrender, they should take the initiative and leave no room for fantasies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even an iron axe, I feel this when I hear this. A trace of shock. He is not afraid to annihilate all the nobles who dare to resist his majesty, but from the methods and means, it is too far away. The North Pearl only uses a watch to determine the future of these nobles, even if she I have never seen each other and have not said a word to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was silent for a moment and said, "Is the result... accurate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be the first The commander of the army, the iron axe naturally understands the meaning of time, and knows how much effort this form can save him. The migration of a large part of the ship is rented from the Fjord Chamber of Commerce, even if the devil is not there. The intention of the vertical cubes in the desperate mountains, the faster the migration should be completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not rule out deviations, even setting the dividing line at 50 is just my personal opinion. Considering the precious time, it is up to you to do it. Let's decide." Isis took a sip of tea without hesitation. "After all, the staff is only responsible for providing advice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe turned to the end One page, that is a list of conclusions that have already come to the conclusion. The intelligence should come from the morning squad, with the lowest ranking below 50, which is the first landing point of the fleet plan, the lord of Shenchiwan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving the office of the General Staff Department, he asked the other person’s last sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there no aristocrat who will not fall behind the times?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course this exists Maybe," Itis rolled up her hair and smiled. "But even without this watch, I believe that you can quickly distinguish it - because that person must be like me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the confident look, the iron axe sighed, he gathered his thoughts and turned to the first military camp. As North Pearl said, nobility is not a problem. How to transfer people in an orderly and efficient manner is difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just two days later, the Shenchiwan dock area has gathered tens of thousands of migrants! They crowded out of the square and waited for boarding. This number not only exceeded the expectations of the Iron Axe and Remy, but even the Baron Bate was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Army had to postpone the departure date to maintain the order of the flow of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" Iron Axe asked Remy. "Is it difficult for you to exaggerate your promise in the publicity?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How dare I make a decision," Remy shook her head again and again. "Everything went according to the process outlined by the previous Executive Office. Its efficiency depends on the prestige of the instigator. If it is not a winter city, it is not surprising that the baron can't compare with his majesty. Therefore, the number of people transferred in the original plan is only between 300 and 500."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The result is now more than twenty times." Iron Axe said in a complicated mood. The more immigrants are, the better, but things that go beyond the plan are always a little disturbing. He knows that it is difficult for these people to abandon their land and believe that the danger is coming soon. Even if the majesty promises a certain compensation, the gray castle is always a far-reaching and strange place for the wolf heart. Now that there are so many more migrants, what is happening behind them is hard to doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have to say something, there may be a situation that may correspond to the present." Remy said after a moment of indulging, "That is the refugees who fled." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because such people have nothing, as long as there is a glimmer of hope, they will rush like a moth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These are free people in the villages and towns near Shenchi Bay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
