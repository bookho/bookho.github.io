			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you want to send me this?" After a while, Tilly put down the puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you remember what happened to you when you were an adult?" Roland said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." She licked her lips. "Is it what you did?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" No, it’s Tiffco and Garcia,” the prince told the past. “But I also have a responsibility. If I tell my father, it won’t happen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The consequence is that you are beaten by them," Tilly vomited. "So you didn't say that the exit is normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This kind of thing will not happen again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought that the more memories in your head are all true knowledge and knowledge," she did not respond. Instead, I changed the subject. "It doesn't seem like this now. Is there anything other than "Panda"? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the other person rolled up his tongue and vaguely made this strange syllable, Roland couldn't help but curl up his mouth. "Of course... countless." If you have the opportunity, I can tell you slowly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly's cleverness is beyond doubt. He believes that if he says half of the words, the other party can understand what he means.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, she stunned and then looked at Roland, thinking thoughtfully in her eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time, outside the door Suddenly the voice of Andrea was heard. "Tilly, I am giving you a gift... You are leaving! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it clear that I am first?" "The sound of the sound is ashes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the first! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland laughed and he stood up. "There have been a lot of unpleasant things in the past, but those have become the past, I think we should not be Memories are bound, whether it is me and you, or Bianbu Town and Sleeping Island. If you are in trouble in the future, you can come to me at any time... I will always be your brother. He paused. "Happy birthday, Tilly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the door, and the two witches were suddenly in the same place, with big eyes and small eyes.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The prince smiled. "No need to fight, the first person is me. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Otto feels lost on the street, Andreia’s words still seem to lie in his ear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have died a few years ago. This is what my father wants to see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that this sentence is not correct, he wants to refute but does not know where to say it. Start. These days, in addition to observing Bianbu Town, the rest of the time will wander around the market, hoping to see her again, but ultimately nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto walked to a stone bench beside the square, took the snow above and sat down slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the surging mind, he still has not forgotten the purpose of his trip. In addition to the military camp, he has gone through every corner of the town, and there is a comprehensive understanding of the place. For example, the life of the townspeople is not so abundant at the beginning, but there is no difference between ordinary and poor places. . All changes came from the lord Roland Wimbledon, who not only led the people to repel the horrible evil spirits, but also invented various magical machinery and tools to improve everyone's life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto witnessed the black machine in the mine area, two three-story shovel can do dozens of people to complete the work, and it is very easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the towering towers along the Chishui River, I heard that I can send water to the residents’ homes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, the ditches excavated around the town's roads seem to be also for the installation of more convenient heating equipment, so that residents do not have to suffer from severe cold. Like this news, he can see it in the bulletin board in the center of the square every day. What is even more shocking is that most of the townspeople here can understand the official documents posted above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more you observe, the more unbelievable it is. The change in Bentham Town is everywhere, and it is completely beyond his imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the book, when Otto intended to record today’s new findings, the hand holding the pen was suddenly caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and found two patrols in black uniforms standing in front of him. "You are the silver eye?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the fake name he used when pretending to be a businessman. Otto did not respond to the sound, and looked around, only to find that the other sides of the square also appeared black uniforms, but did not come close, sight I have been staring at this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are coming to find their own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto’s heart sinks, before he thought that the patrol here was different from what he saw outside, and he acted very well. He didn’t expect to get into trouble now. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the matter?" He whispered, for these greedy and greedy greed, there is no benefit in pleading for softness, even if it is blackmail, you can't let the other person Large opening. If you can't get rid of it, you can only move out of your aristocratic identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the black uniform’s answer was completely out of Otto’s expectation. “We received a report and suspected that you were carrying out espionage. Now you are holding your hands behind you and following Instructed action. If there is any rebellious intention, we cannot guarantee that you are safe and sound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spy? What is the reason... Do they want to find a replacement ghost? "I can't understand what you said," Otto opened the other arm. "I am a nobleman from the morning kingdom, the Losi family of Glow City, not at all-"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just at the moment of his hand, the abdomen was suddenly slammed into a punch, and the strength of his body suddenly disappeared. Most of the acid poured into his mouth, and the body involuntarily curled up. Then the two men pressed him down in the icy snow, and his hands were tied tightly by the ropes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Noble? You can say that you are a businessman a few days ago." One sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I reminded you not to resist," another person licked him again. "This is what you are looking for."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago? Is it difficult for them to stare at themselves early? This is impossible... at least for the first two days, there is absolutely no patrol to notice his whereabouts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough...I am indeed a nobleman, there are ... instruments in the bag," Otto struggled twice, but the other party was unmoved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and explain to Carter," the two men raised him. "If you confess all, there may be a way to live."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being held in jail for one day, Otto, who was hungry and thirsty, finally saw it. They are the adults of Carter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the other party’s opening, he grabbed the iron railing and poured out his brain. “I’m really Otto Losy, the glow city from the morning kingdom. I was commissioned by the Lord of the Morning, to come to the Grey Fortress to seek to fight against the church's allies, not the spies in your mouth! I want to see your lord, Your Royal Highness, Roland Wimbledon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness in the prison has long been heard, the patrols often collude with mice, imprison some foreign visitors as scapegoats, if they are considered by them to be a lamb without a path, I am afraid they will never see the sky again. The opportunity is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party apparently stunned. "I didn't ask anything." He turned his head. "What do you think of the result?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene that surprised Otto appeared. I saw a woman in the shadow. She was covered in a white robe and her face was covered by a hood, but From the figure, her appearance is no worse than the "Glowing Flower". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
