			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow forest is suddenly quiet, leaving only the subtle winds that occasionally smash over the tops of the treetops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice has been silent for a long time, "I thought you would stand on the side of Takira," she said with some reluctance. "You are obviously willing to represent Taqi." Pulling the witch to participate, I am willing to help..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice is going down very quickly, yes, I shouldn’t impose too much, it’s just a game. Compared to the Takilla Detective Society that once crowded her, it is clear that the Winter City, which saved her life, is more trustworthy. Moreover, in the eyes of Ai Gesha, whether they are the inheritors of Takira still have two to say... After all, they have lost the possibility of exerting magic power after they have been transformed into gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the other party’s next sentence made her hope again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a Taqila witch, this will not change."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha The voice is flat and candid, as if it were the simplest statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why do you think we should accept the leadership of mortals?" Felice felt puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tajira...or dozens of cities in the Star City, Anretta, and the Fertile Plains, all unanimously decided to accept the leadership of the Federation Is it because the federation was established by the witch?” Ai Gesha sighed. “Don't you forget the original intention of the association?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The initial ... purpose, whether it is the beginning of the round table parliament, or the subsequent three-seat system, the federation is only to achieve one thing. "Win the devil." Felice whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, defeating the devil is not related to whether it is a mortal. After the first battle of the gods, the witch cuts the authority of the mortal, and the plain is only a fertile plain. Because their performance is too weak, limited cooperation can't resist the devil's attack. Now that mortal people have demonstrated their power, then what is the difference between us playing for the federation and playing for Roland Wimbledon? Only he can integrate the entire secular regime and accept the witches of this era."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha’s words crossed in her mind like a flash of lightning-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice found herself seemingly misunderstood something, and her new ideas surprised her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean... no winter city is the new federation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's part of the federation," Aegusa corrected. "Of course, His Majesty may not like this name. But no matter what it is called in the future, the essence is still the same - in order to win the gods, Takira is also good, falling. Star City, as well as the Communist Youth League, the Sleeping Island... and the secular kingdom, will unite and start a bloody battle with the devil to determine the fate. This is not a question of loyalty, but to continue, I can be from the hail Live, and that is the moment to defeat the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she will answer, she is loyal to her beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice finally understood the other side's thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha hopes to win the game on behalf of Tacila, and she does not conflict with Roland Wimbledon, just like four hundred years ago, fertile soil All the city-states in the plains work for the federation. The only difference is that the leader of the new alliance has changed from three seats to one mortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really high enough for him," she said in a very complicated mood. "If we just want to defeat the devil, we are constantly working hard and once If you find the winner, the situation will be reversed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But is it not yet found? Or, found an unexpected "natural selection" By". "Ai Gesha chuckled, "Reassured, if there is such a witch, Your Majesty will certainly not stop you from ending the battle of God. In fact, he will only help you find her." This is also the reason why I hope that you can move into the west of the Grey Fort. The witches who are willing to settle here will inevitably become more and more. You will find that the odds of the winners are also greater, aren't they? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis found herself being moved, although she did not want to admit it, but she said it is not without reason. "The premise is that he can indeed block the devil..." Do you really have this confidence for mortals? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
