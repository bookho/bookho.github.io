			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland walks into a messy castle, the Earl of Perrault and Hermon I kneel in the hall and greet my arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodies on the ground have all been removed, but the bloody smell is still lingering, and the broken furnishings and broken weapons can be seen everywhere, he can almost imagine In the process of competing for the castle, the two sides repeatedly killed the scene here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get up," Roland walked over to him, bending over and holding his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Pedro’s voice was a little choked. "Your Highness, you are finally here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You have done a good job," he said, "the four families will pay the price they deserve, and the murderer will be brought to justice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I have not been able to keep a long song fortress for you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have tried your best, this is not your fault," Roland sighed. Tone. Pei Luo is not a manager who can fight for good warfare. It can be seen from the previous Qingqi wins the city and this aristocratic rebellion. He is good at operating territories, is very proficient in trade, and is good at capturing opportunities, but not a power seeker. Fighting and conspiracy are not at work. This time, if the Second Army did not enter the castle in accordance with emergency measures, I am afraid that he could not hold it for two days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that Pedro Hermon is not a good manager. If he is not good at fighting, he should give him a territory that does not need to fight. Compared with the talents that can be played, Roland prefers the operators who have the minds of businessmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe there must be incentives for this riot," he looked around at the venue. "This is a downright conspiracy, and the enemy is trying to subvert the order of the West." Seek not in their interests!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene is quiet, whether it is the first soldier who is armed with a gun, or the knight with a wound behind him. His eyes gazed to the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For this reason, they did not hesitate to commit felony, murder the nobility, kill the people. After the war today, I don’t know how many people will lose their families and how many houses will be In the end, their plots failed to succeed. It was your unyielding resistance that prevented the fortress from falling into a bigger tragedy. Your performance is heroic, and your will is worthy of praise!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights unconsciously put their chests a little higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the battle is not over yet, these traitors are fleeing, and then we are taking revenge! I swear, no matter where the enemy hides, escape But the trial that will come, whether it is in the territory of the four major families... or in the kingdom!" Rolandton paused, and said categorically, "and the chief culprit of the rebellion will inevitably be sanctioned! Your blood... ...no white flow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long live the Highness!" Earl of Pero and Hermon smashed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long live the Highness, long live!" Then came the surviving Knights and Second Army soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything everyone is kneeling on one knee, the upper body is straight, the right hand is holding the chest, and a slogan is shouted in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hiroy Laurent, Long Live!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After appease the people present, Roland recruited Pedro, Fanna, Brian and Iron Axe to the study on the third floor of the castle. This is the only place that has not been invaded, and the furnishings are basically intact. He knows that he will probably spend his time here in the next few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to understand the situation in the city, he looked at the iron axe, the latter immediately reported in the report: "The four major families occupy the North Gate and the East Gate have been Retrieved by the witch, now the first army is clearing the insurgents in the city under the guidance of Miss Hilvey, and it is time to restore the order in the city tomorrow morning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
