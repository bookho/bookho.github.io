			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the opportunity of the next day's court meeting, Joel made a request to attend the present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably just had a peace treaty, the request was quickly passed, and two knights dressed in exquisite armor ushered him into the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two or three months ago, he had repeatedly asked to see his majesty, and finally he was sinking into the sea, without any news. Now he hopes that Anpein’s Majesty can ignore his request as he used to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the reality is always so unsatisfactory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entering the hall, the court meeting is clearly nearing completion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young king is leaning against the throne and talking with his ministers. When he sees Joan’s kneeling, Anpein is sitting right, “No need to Etiquette, I heard that you brought a letter from Roland Wimbledon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, respectful majesty," Joel replied with a hard scalp "He congratulated on your coronation and hoped that the friendship between the two countries would last for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a fresh statement," Anpein. Moya smiled. "So, what gift does he have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this... Of course," the ambassador was in a hurry, "the team that delivers the gift." Still on the road, this letter was sent by quick horse transfer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I remembered that Wimbledon III was crowned, my father sent a There are two hundred people in the team, and there are eleven horse-drawn carriages carrying gifts. There are a lot of gold, wine, satin and beauty. I don’t know what this Roland’s return will be. . Is looking forward to ah "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ministers echoed in a burst of laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there such a thing? Joel can't help but feel a bit dry, why is there no mention of the gift in the letter? I don't know if I am still excusable, but I don't know if I don't know Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He said something else?" asked Anpein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, Joel even wanted to retire directly, but when he thought of annoying the Lord of the Morning, he was rejected by the Wangdu nobles at the most, if he let Luo Lan kneel down Disappointed, this ambassador may have to change someone else, and he has to endure it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty...呃...I hope that you will stop the persecution of the witches and give them the treatment of the free people," Joel said, "Other words, gray." Fort will not turn a blind eye to this kind of behavior, and the church is the best example."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this is said, the temple is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambassador felt a sweat on his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roland. Wimbledon really said that?" After a while, Anpein Moya began to speak. "Take the letter to you." Let me see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a knight who walked to Joel and passed the parchment roll in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he doesn’t dare to look at the eyes of the Lord of the Morning, he can still hear the other person’s tone is already cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of the text that occupies more than half of the condemnation and warnings, Joel’s heart is crying on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Anpei fell directly to the ground after reading it. "This is the attitude of the Grey Fortress to the allies? The witch is innocent, so I must put "They have a little nonsense!" The young king seems to be unable to control his emotions. He stood up from the throne and murdered. "Look at what the damn witches did to the Moya family, invade the palace, slaughter. The guards, also using my father's life, told me to obey the church! If they didn't poison my father, he should still sit here very well!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; But he is dead, can you get on the throne? However, this statement only dared to talk in the stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
