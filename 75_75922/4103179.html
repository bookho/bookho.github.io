			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, the reflection church is not only the handover of the previous pope, but also a museum itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bust of the church’s powers displayed inside is of great historical significance, not to mention the ability to review historical events through holographic images. The magic stone is printed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are going to be a tourist attraction in the future, the tickets will definitely be very hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that now that Roland wants to go in, it takes a lot of effort – the reflection church is completely mirrored, but it’s in the underground of the Old City Church. The two are not connected. The slate and clay in the middle are more than ten meters thick, and the stone of the gods is filled with scattered pieces. Whether it is manpower or direct passage through the magical ark, it is very troublesome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After asking Isabella for details, he decided to enter from the underground passage of the monastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, these passages were previously unimpeded, and although they were manually destroyed and blocked, they were not a big problem for Magic Ark. More importantly, the abandoned passage will not be affected by the stone. Compared with the entire cave, it is shrouded in the secret mechanism under the influence of the Shenshi vein. The former is naturally safe and secure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to avoid getting lost, he also let Sylvie pre-scanned it and determined the best route for this sightseeing trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these preparations, the witches also learned the news. On the day of departure, Roland found a bunch of people gathered outside the camp, and the little girl lightning was the most excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, such an important adventure, how can you not call me!" She pouted, as if she had been wronged by the big day, "Don't me?" Not your chief explorer!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey! Adventure!” McMug helped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...this is just a sightseeing tour, the place of the Pope’s passing place, what is the danger?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I want to go...do you?" asked the little girl with a winking look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no way to refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the first one, there will naturally be latecomers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, bring me," Hummingbird whispered, "I can help you with your luggage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As a member of the Quest, how can I miss such a crucial moment, are you right, squat?" The speaker is Ai Gesha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to go where Anna is going!" The crisp voice came from Nana. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you have a plague infected in this underground building, you are in trouble. Are you not saying that the place where the air is not circulating is the most susceptible to the disease?" Lily A serious way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it’s the Queen of Stars, I want to see her again..." More than a witch, even "Seventy-six" Felice has scraped together. come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, isn't she the enemy of your Tacila?" Roland was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she is also a respectable leader - if there is no Akaris, we will not be able to support the differences."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... In the end, almost everyone got what they wanted to get on the ride to the reflection church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Roland was only going to bring Anna, Nightingale, Sylvie and Isabella, and now because of the substantial increase in participants, Maggie had to ship several times back and forth. Only then will everyone be brought into the abandoned tunnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These intricate tunnels, although closed for a long time, remain intact. There is no sign of water seepage, and it is not eroded by plant roots. In addition to more dust, it walks very smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
