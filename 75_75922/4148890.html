			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, stick to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a gentle hillside behind the camp. It’s almost impossible to withdraw from the top of the mountain with a shot of rain. The rescue team is also split and can’t get it in a short time. Reliable support. In a situation where the situation is extremely unfavorable, sticking to it is the only way to cause the greatest damage to the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the difference in the number of people on both sides is too great, plus the backpacks are filled with food, clothes and other supplies, even a heavy machine gun is not brought This makes the weapons on both sides basically at the same level, and it is difficult to make up for the shortage of the number by remote firepower as in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty to one thousand, fish balls have been expected to come to fruition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He admits that when this thought comes out, his heart is still a little scared, but he is not the coward in the past who will only retreat, fear will not affect him. As the squad leader's duties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he is dead here, he has to pay the other party enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously other teammates have the same idea at the moment, otherwise they will not deliberately press the shooting speed and put the enemy into the 200 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bullets that everyone carries are limited, and only in the middle and close combat can the best hit rate be achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the enemy’s alignment will also increase because of the shortened distance. This is a double-edged sword, and the will will determine everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hillside delayed the action of the other party, and the fish balls waited for nearly a minute before they saw someone entering the 100-meter circle - at this distance, he was able to use the lookout The mirror sees the face of the sneak attacker. This also confirms his previous speculation that most of the people's faces are clean, and they are not like the fleeing people in the rain. Their actions and looks are not showing any signs of being forced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer has to worry about killing innocents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish pill aligns the trigger at the foremost enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teammates around him also chose to fire at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, the gunshots on the camp suddenly became loud, and instantly overshadowed the other’s movements. The attacker who rushed to the front of the head blinked and fell, and the offensive momentum suddenly became a stagnation. The enemies around him squatted and fired back at the First Army. They did not know whether they had explored such a confrontation method in the past battles, or they were guided by the devil, and the situation became mutual confrontation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the stalemate on both sides, the enemies in the back pushed several blinded two-wheeled carts to the position near the striker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of toy fish ball is no stranger. Compared with horse-drawn carriages and scorpions, the trucks that are pushed and pulled by humans are more suitable for ordinary people to use, especially for family relocation and need. When transporting large quantities of goods. He thought that it was only the props used by the enemy to cover up his identity, but he did not expect that after the start of the charge, the other party still did not give up these bulky carts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the cover cloth was opened, the fish ball was found to be a Mark type heavy machine gun on the board! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哒哒哒""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid spurt suddenly suppressed the First Army The firepower, and its bullets have a tracer effect, the head is much better than the bolting rifle. Before the camp, it was like boiling, and the grass covered with wildflowers was splashed. If there were no camps to resist, I was afraid that this wave would make them lose the ability to fight back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the enemy did not set the machine gun position at the farthest distance, but put it into the charge together. Now the distance between the machine gun and the line of defense is only about two hundred meters, and the first army is enough to open, which gives them a chance to breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hansen!" shouted fish balls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is more than a clear gesture, carrying a rifle all the way to the edge of the camp. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army rarely encountered a situation in which the firepower was in a downwind. According to the regulations in the combat manual, once it was caught in a disadvantageous position, the rear artillery should be called as soon as possible. Support, or specifically against the enemy's fire points. Obviously, the only action the rescue team can take at this time is to use the efficient and accurate sniper to shock the enemy's offensive momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
