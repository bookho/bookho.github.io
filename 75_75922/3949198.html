			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Brian said, once the town of Bianque is snowing, it will not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, the town has been covered with a layer of white gauze. By the early morning, the snow was weakened, and occasionally a few pieces of fragmented snow fell in the sky, but the sky was still gray. Thinking of seeing the sun for months, Roland felt incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is totally unreasonable. He thinks that although it is strange to find common sense in the world of witches' magic, how does the evil beast affect the sky? Unfortunately, he does not have a meteorological satellite to tell himself about the specific distribution of the world's cloud map. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the West Wall, Carter couldn’t help but sigh: "There is a lot of cold in the town, and there are still a bunch of guys who have withdrawn from the nobility."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s good, at least they won’t delay,” Rolandha said. “I have arranged for Barov to conduct a census this winter.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the door-to-door statistics, how many people are left behind What is the name of a family, what kind of occupation, and then register," Roland explained. "In this way, whether it is the deployment of human resources in wartime or the post-war payment, can be implemented quickly and effectively." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...human resources?" Carter blinked and smiled. "His Royal Highness, you are really different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before you, though Some things that I don't understand, do some inexplicable things, but after all, things that don't match the identity of the prince. And now..." Carter paused for a moment and seemed to be considering words. "Whether it's the weird training regulations you set. The novelty test items that were moved from the alchemy workshop were surprisingly effective. Perhaps this is what my grandfather said. The extraordinary person is so extraordinary because he always sees places that ordinary people ignore. I have a feeling. Maybe you can really be the next king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...is it," Roland suddenly had a warmth in his heart, what better than struggle? After being recognized by the people, is it more fulfilling? For a time he felt his hands and feet full of strength, and the gray sky was not so boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the city wall, the militia team is cleaning up the snow on the aisle, seeing the prince appear, and everyone is going to salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should be taught to march, Roland thought, "How was the situation last night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no trace of the evil beast," answered him with an iron axe. "His Highness, according to past experience, after the first snow, we still have a relatively stable period. The number of evil beasts during this period is not Most of them are alien animals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded. "Continue to stay alert."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area behind the wall has been transformed into a barracks. When there is no warning, most people will rest in the camp to save energy. Vigilance implements the rotation system. Considering the low temperature in winter, each team will only change the round after two hours of patrol alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures are all set by Roland. He had asked Brian and learned that there is no plan for a long song fortress to resist evil spirits. The most unlucky recruits will be sent to monitor the movements of the evil spirits, and stay on the wall for a whole day. Therefore, laziness and escape have occurred from time to time. In the winter, as many as twenty or thirty people have been hanged because of dereliction of duty or violation of military orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the discovery of the trail of evil beasts, it is even worse, neither dividing the defense zone nor assigning responsibility to people. Reminiscent of the level of war in this era, Roland will be clear. Extremely stressful personal courage, emphasizing honor and robbing, even the Cavaliers will have a bloody head on their own charge, or do not ask too high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the wall, it seems that everything is going well, but Roland found himself ignoring a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to guide the roadblock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
