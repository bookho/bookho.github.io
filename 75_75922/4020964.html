			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You continue," Roland could not help but rise up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The terrain of Hermes is very unique. The desolate mountains have left a gentle slope here, the old holy city below, and the new holy city is built on the plateau. Above, the environment there is very bad, except that it can be used to resist the evil spirits, and it is not suitable for living, let alone cultivated land. Therefore, the food and materials needed for the new holy city need to be provided by the old holy city - but then The land owned by the people is only enough to feed more than 20,000 people under the mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis walked to Roland and pointed at the map, "This means they Need to collect food from other places, such as churches and church organizations in nearby cities, most of them will buy a piece of land, or rent wheat fields to the lords to cultivate. Every autumn, the carriages from the four kingdoms have dozens of daily. The car is to replenish the new holy city on the plateau. Up to now, a small town similar to the market has been formed outside the old holy city, which can be used for the rest of the team and to keep the church in order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In other words, if they decide to send large-scale trial troops to the outside world, they will never escape the eyes of these businessmen. Even if the army has not yet officially acted, we can estimate the timing of the other party’s dispatch by changing the scale of the material delivery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She speaks a lot like a later speech, and her eyes will sweep through the people in the room, confirming that they are focusing on themselves, showing little confidence Will appear on the woman of this era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought, it seems that Calvin Kant’s letter is not entirely bragging, at least in this manner, it is enough to deserve the North Pearl. The title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you know so clearly?" Barov shook his beard. "It’s like coming out of the Holy City."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have lived there for a while," Itis replied without hesitation, "because of the evil moon convention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is that?" Roland asked questioningly. He had a little impression of the term in his mind, but he couldn’t think of what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know?" She blinked. "In order to help the church fight against the evil moon, the four kingdoms need to send troops to support Hermes." The holy city, fighting with the trial army. Your brother Gordon Wimbledon is the commander of the Grey Fort Border Army, and I have also fought under him. However, the last year seems to have changed, the four kingdoms The coalition forces heard that the death and injury were exhausted, and the church’s trial army suffered equally heavy losses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is such a thing," Pei Luohe said, "My friend Ray It was there that M. Meade completed his test of the knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every knight must fight against the evil beast to be sealed?" Roland looked Carter, "How have you not heard of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, this is a means that knights in small places often love," Carter said, "King The Knights have their own rules, and in addition to brave martial arts, loyalty and knowledge are also very important aspects, not light and fierce monsters to play on a Proof."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Your Majesty," Itis did not refute Carter’s words, but turned to look at Roland. "Let me see you." How did the army fight? I have been very curious about how you captured the kingdom in one day. If you can understand the battle style of the First Army, I may be able to help in the war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a big problem. Now the weapons and equipment of the First Army can not be imitated by the two eyes. As the technology advances, the war is getting more and more The characteristics of spending money are gradually reflected. Without a complete logistics supply system and industrial production guarantee, even if a batch of firearms is given to the other party, it will not be used. Moreover, showing force to the loyalists in the North can not only improve the confidence of the other side, but also deter them from thinking. I think of it here, Roland nodded to the iron axe. "You can arrange it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I suggest that you, in the name of the King, issue an expulsion church to every town in the Grey Fort. The law." Barov is not willing to fall behind Itis, "Once, once the war begins, the church will become a stronghold for them to swallow the kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I am afraid that there are not many lords who do this. The churches are generally big tax collectors. The power of the church is also taboo. They are more inclined to see the wind and the rudder." Itis shrugged. "This is also the consistent behavior of the nobility. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
