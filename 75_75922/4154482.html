			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you see in the tiankeng?" Roland stood up in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry..." Camilla was a little embarrassed. "My level of painting is only this level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture on the desk is the picture of the big housekeeper according to Joan’s memory, but not to mention the book apprentice level compared to the book and Soroya. They are all far apart - the short lines are dense, the twisted circles are pits, and the uplifted slopes are mountains, while those wavy lines represent the sea, which is similar to stick figures in the eyes of outsiders. Can not be used as a reference object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen the legendary bottomless in his dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is also the "end point" of the battle of the gods, the passage for the victory of the victory group. Although it was eventually swallowed up by the tsunami and the volcano, the towns built on it were completely destroyed, but the general terrain was still not too changed. For example, the flat side of one side is raised, and the towering continent is faintly visible in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it was confirmed by the eyes, it was always a illusory legend. After all, the northern end of the ray of light stretched thousands of kilometers, and the humans before the federation failed to draw a A detailed map, even if it does not exist, is a question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From beginning to end, there is only a mention of the position of the bottomless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Joan’s experience has turned it into reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is enough." Roland can't wait to move the big map out of the bookcase, spread it on the floor in front of the table, and then place the drawing on it. In the direction of the east-north of the mainland, "it is probably here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the hell is that?" Camilla couldn’t help but ask, "I It is not considered to be a naturally formed collapse pit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why would you think so?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s clear," she said, "How can the pit be adjusted to this extent? And the weird seabed, the land on the sky and Sea water, it’s strange to see how it looks.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sinks for a moment, “I think there is no such thing as natural.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What...meaning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, there is no hidden forest and grassland west of Winter City, it is probably just a wasteland before. However, when a bird and a beast brought the seed here, it gradually evolved into what it is today. As long as the time is long enough, such a hypothesis must be established, but later people think that this is the inherent appearance between heaven and earth. Is it true? Don't you feel weird?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camilla frowned. "I don't understand what you are talking about."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, Roland sighed, and these truths are indeed too complicated for the contemporary, and it is normal to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that." The nightingale chewing on the dried fish suddenly slammed. "What you want to say is that we are no different from birds and beasts, right? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a mystery?" The big housekeeper licked his forehead with a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think about it," the nightingale pointed to the city road in the night window. "The birds and beasts brought the seeds here, forming forests and grasslands; human migration." To the north slope of the mountain, the establishment of a winter-free city; for this world, the essence should be the same. Our so-called natural, just standing on their own point of view, even if replaced by a bird, will not feel Tree shrews are more natural than eaves, otherwise how can they build nests on the latter? According to this inference, the circular tiankeng and the counter-current seawater are as part of the natural world as the hidden forest and no winter city." Aaron, "maybe the moon stars on our heads are also formed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Camilla stunned for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
