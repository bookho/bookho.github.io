			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hakala feels that the people under him are breathing fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change people," she said, "Leaves, you come back to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Walking in the foothills of the desolate mountains is very labor-intensive, especially in the snowy winter. Forty-two witches must not find a suitable campsite in the end of the day, and recharge the badge to withstand the temperature of the sudden drop in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Master." A witch squatted in front of her. She summoned the snake to wrap around her arm and smothered herself. At the same time, she noticed a slight tremor that the other person could not help herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damn nightingale, Hakhara hated to think that if she did not refuse her kindness again and again, she would not succumb to the sisters. At the critical moment of the upcoming sacred mountain, Hakala will never allow any accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result? After the traitor escaped from the bondage, he did not hesitate and wanted to stab himself... Look, this is the end of kindness! Hakhara's brain tumbling with anger, the thorn stabbed her spine, and although the leaf-modified herbs quickly healed the wound, the lower body was already paralyzed and the feet completely lost consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Holy Mountain is called, more witches are gathered, and one day I will take her back to the corpse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Instructor, there are evil beasts in front of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsible for investigation . Her eyes can ignore obstacles and shadows, and any traps are in front of her. At the same time, it has a very high ability to capture moving objects. In the confrontation with the church, it has personally defeated the arrow of the trial army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me down, leaf you to help them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carrying her witch Nodded, crouched down and placed her on a stone. The hands holding the body did not fall into the snow, and the cold feeling came through the palm of the hand. Hakala thought some unpleasantly, wouldn't you take the snow off and let me down? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she did not say anything. The leaves are irreplaceable characters in the ranks. If the Communist Youth League is to gather the witches by the temper of Wendy’s good old man, the leaves are the guarantee that everyone has the courage to follow them. Without her ability, I am afraid that most of the witches will die on the way to the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of Wendy, Hakala couldn’t help but feel a pain in her heart. She didn’t expect that the person who created the co-help association with herself would actually The nightingale betrayed himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when Wendy shot her, she never thought about killing each other. The venom secreted by the magic snake "Bitter Pain" is effective, and the pain is unbearable but it does not immediately kill people. After being bitten by "Nothingness", it can quickly remove toxins... She just wants to give Wendy a bit of trouble. If left unattended, the toxins will still be incurable after invading the head. It was a wrong decision to take her away with the nightingale. Without the "virtual" detoxification solution, Wendy could not support it for one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true that she was once a church nun, destined to be able to go to the end with her sisters? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the other rebels, lightning, Hakala did not care. The time to join the co-help club is very short. The ability seems to be flying. In the search for the sacred mountain clues, different opinions are always put forward, and even the holy book is openly questioned. If it is not contrary to the concept of the Communist Party, she really wants to throw this little girl into the snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil beast emerged from the hillside, two wolf-shaped creatures. The witches of the co-helpers have been comfortable with this situation. Sisters who have no fighting ability move closer to the rear. The leaves take the lead in driving the magic, letting the weeds at the feet of the evil beast grow up, and the green leaves break out of the snow in the blink of an eye, wrapped around the enemy's feet. Another witch chased the air around the evil beast, and watched the two monsters quickly fall into a state of suffocation, foaming at the mouth, and twitching to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the power of the witch, Hakala thought. When the mortal only by the sword is facing two evil spirits, they will lose their lives if they are not careful. Only the witch with magical power is the darling of the gods. If it is not the stone of God's punishment - oh, the stone of hell is right, she spits on the ground, if not by this abominable stone, how can the church ride on their heads? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
