			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king is coming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the army of Roland Wimbledon entered Chishui City, the news began to spread in the streets and lanes of the old Wangdu, and was returned to the Lord of Silver City. After reaching the peak. Although a small number of people have repeatedly stressed that he has not been enthroned, compared with the title of rebel and invaders a year ago, most people have already believed that the future king of the Grey Fort is non-Roland - even more likely This trip is for the sake of coronation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the new king’s movements don’t seem to be positive. Every time you go to a city, it will stay for a few weeks, so when the news comes true, the time is already in the middle of summer. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rising temperature did not detract from people’s interest. The pub was all about the sound of the throne, and the streets were lined with ribbons. All the private houses on the floor were rented out. The old king, who is gradually showing a depression, seems to have restored the vitality of the past. Perhaps at this time, it will remind the people who live here of the style that the king should have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a year, Roland once again set foot on this territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the girl passed through the gate, the petals collected by the girls were all over the sky, and the crowd’s shouts ignited the city instantly—they were not Praise the wise or benevolent of the new king. For the Wangdu people, this is just a habit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nini and pods are one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two got the best seats to overlook the audience because they lived on a tower close to the main street. Parents are busy with the spectators who are renting a house. They have no time to control the two little devils. They are also happy to climb the top of the tower and watch the grand military enter the city on the red brick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s coming... Is the man standing on the carriage the King’s Majesty? He looks much younger than His Royal Highness,” Nini Shouting, "Wow, hurry, he is waving to us! The Master of Feike can not do this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" is in this direction Everyone," the pod shrugged. "We climbed so high that he found it strange."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our course is among all people "Isn't this sentence correct?" Nini said with a strong sigh. "Looking at the face, he is much better than His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His Majesty shackled a large number of nobles, including the one who was the son of Tiffco, his brother. The tentacle that was temporarily built in the square is still there. If you add a mouse, he will be killed in the king. The most ruled ruler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, why are you singing against me?" Nini snorted angrily A. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't like him," said the pod. "He didn't regard the city as his home. He promoted the opportunity to work in the West. People go to the west, what do we do? Now the number of patrons opened by my father is more than half, isn’t it thanks to him?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who do you like, His Royal Highness Prince?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Also hate, in order to catch a witch, the whole city is not peaceful... the best is the old king, At least not-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, look! The woman next to me!" Nini waited for him to finish, and then disputed The topic was thrown behind the head and pointed to the king's open carriage. "She turned around... God, she is too beautiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The pods had to sigh with helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the discovery seems to have become the new focus of attention - the ability to be with the king at this moment, the meaning of its representative is almost self-evident. The noisy arguments on both sides of the street suddenly rose a bit, and obviously everyone was interested in this strange and beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the two suddenly heard a strange whistling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not yet waiting for them to reflect, a gray figure, such as the arrow of the string, passed in front of the two, straight into the tower. Then there was a panic shouting downstairs. It seemed that someone had fallen to the ground and there was a crackling crack in the glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, but it seems to be coming to our house!" The pod turned up anxiously. "Let's go back and see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Um!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two climbed down the brick wall in tandem and jumped into the house from the window, but was surprised to find several wearing armor The warriors have surrounded the guests in the house, and there are a few feathers on the ground in addition to the scattered drinks and utensils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nini’s first reaction was that the pods were heard and the second reaction was to hide his mouth and hide, no matter what he saw. No sound can be made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, neither idea was realized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of landing, the samurai noticed two "uninvited guests", but no one came to catch them, but they grinned at them. After half an hour's clock, the people quickly sneaked out, leaving only a stunned parent and guest. One of the seemingly headed characters also took out ten silver wolves and handed them to the stunned father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until everyone left, Nini hesitated to go forward, "What the hell...what happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s incredible,” the father said with excitement. “When the guard of honor passed the corner of the street, a spectator suddenly pulled out a good string of bows and directed directly at the king’s armpit. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nini took a sigh of relief, "And then?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We All were frightened, and if the arrow was shot, a house could not live. Fortunately, at this time, a bird... No, a person flew in to stop the guy!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can’t be said that she flew in when she was a bird, but when she hit the head, it became The person - is a little girl who is about the same size as you." A guest added, "We only see the bow falling to the ground before reacting. The crowd will suppose the assassin, and then, those I broke in and broke in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you didn't look at the eyes?" The pod questioned, "That bird... No, that person who will change birds?" You won't be stealing the water of dreams, will you have hallucinations?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When we subdued the assassin, she was gone," Father raised his palm After taking pictures of his son, he fanned him. "In addition, I suspect that I am suffering from it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people can't help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nini has focused on the feathers - their color looks like a normal goshawk wing, but it is much wider and softer. She carefully collected the feathers, then did not look at the mirror and looked up and down the mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks like she can fly like it... The little girl is satisfied with it, just use this to make a new headgear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seemingly thrilling assassination did not set off any waves, and people quickly moved the topic back to the king’s group, but they did not know Places, similar things have happened at least ten times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the warning of Sylvie, all the single actions that pinned their hopes on luck were unsuccessful. Even most of the premeditated patrols took the target directly without even disturbing the surrounding masses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s hard for you," Roland said, waving his hand and nodding his head toward the carriage behind him. "I didn't expect the old king to have such a redundant party. It seems that the situation is not as stable as I imagined."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what I should do, sire." Hillvi replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you know instability, you should not choose this way to enter the city," the unwelcome voice comes from Ai Gesha - I don't know if it is age relationship When it comes to security issues, Roland feels that her temper is getting more and more like a book. "Where mortals are too fragile, sometimes you can kill your life with just a humble wound."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
