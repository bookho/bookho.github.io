			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s been a quarter of an hour," Celine said with a sigh of relief. "It seems that he hasn't encountered anything."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a pity, he’s lucky.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to pin my results on probability," she still complains in her tone. "Please choose a safer method next time, can you?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not talk about what has happened," Elsie changed the subject. "Guess, how long can the mortal king stay in it? In the era of the times, in the records left by mortals, the highest is less than a quarter of an hour?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Witches are not so good, in the realm of the gods The time of persistence has nothing to do with the magic. Even the federation is a group of mortals who take turns to monitor the relics. However, considering the age and experience of the king, it should be coming soon."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to all the records that Celine has read, the warriors who have experienced the battlefield and fought with the devil will last longer, whether it is a witch or a mortal. The highest record was created by the Akaris adults, almost a whole hour. As a king behind the scenes, it is very good to have such a performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe he would want to stay longer, after all, it was the first time to witness such a wonder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "They will be dizzy and even fainted." Celine suddenly realized what she was looking at, looking at Pasha. "Did you forget to tell him this?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The coma is not a sinister, nor does it cause substantial harm." Pasha swayed the tentacles. "On the contrary, this disfigured discomfort can reduce his urge to contact the relics of the gods. It’s a good thing for everyone.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So...you are not forgetting?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Pasha is undecided, "Some things are not better, but if you change to us, you should not want to be too restrictive when exploring the gods?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand now why Nataya will choose you as one of the three candidates." El said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyrin couldn’t help but feel the same. Compared to the frightened manner, the exhaustion of energy and coma can be seen as a withdrawal without side effects, which can reduce the curiosity of mortals without destroying the relationship between the two sides. Obviously, Pasha is more than both of them. Far-reaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waiting for a while, she frowned slightly. "It’s been more than a quarter of an hour. Is he okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa looked at Roland Wimbledon, who was still sitting, "It seems... there is nothing unusual. This mortal king can surprise people everywhere." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The new record was born, should I say congratulations?" Elk shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin didn’t answer, she was a little nervous in her heart, and she always felt that something was wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next wait seems to verify her guess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, Roland was still motionless, and she felt more anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the passage of time, a person who has lived for hundreds of years should feel extremely vague, but this heart's almost constant heart beat can be accurate. Tell her every change in every moment. The exploration of the three quarters of an hour has been said for a long time. The other party is neither an extraordinary person nor a warrior. It should have been exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it... what happened to the gods in the past that has never been noticed before? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty couldn’t help but step forward and seemed to want to wake up the king, but was stopped by Pasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are too close to the relics, you will be affected by it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't bring back to the king even if you go in. No matter how many people are inspired by it at the same time, the realm of the gods you see is unique."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celine noticed that another witch who had been hiding her body had an action. From the vague magic reaction, she pulled something out of her arms. According to the information that Felice had learned, it should be no. The unique weapon of winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After passing on his own expressed concern to the other two, Pasha nodded and immediately took action. She reached out to touch the mortal king and pulled him back to Wendy. Although ending exploration in this way is not the most ideal outcome, nothing is more important than Roland's security. Once conflicts occur on both sides, the consequences will be unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the relics of the gods being reloaded into the stone box, Roland is fierce Opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty... Are you okay?" Wendy asked him to stand up and ask eagerly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem...well," he licked some numb legs. "I saw an alien monster guarding the other two relics." I also talked to them, but they didn't understand what I said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" Serin was shocked. "Is it not?" ...you have met the devil and..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And with a huge eyeball, it looks like it is in a boat that can sail underwater. "Roland answered. "Of course, I am not sure if it is a ship, or something else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you don’t see the expression of your companion, Celine could also feel the shock of the other two from the consciousness passed from the surging, especially Elsie. She is the longest survivor of the illusion of illusion - the experience of being a sacred lord has allowed Els to stick to it for about half an hour, but that is only when the picture is empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you run into the devil or another enemy, the energy consumption will multiply! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And then, what happened?" Pasha asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't tell, in short, some black tentacles suddenly appeared in the picture and attacked them." Roland will talk about the situation. Again, "Those tentacles feel very difficult, they have to withdraw the scrolls, the whole process is a few minutes... No, about a quarter of an hour."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he means is that he has encountered two other civilized caretakers at the same time, not only unscathed, but also forced the other party to retreat? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin is like listening to a fantasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not surprising that there are black tentacles. As the energy continues to drop, the influence of the relics on the explorers will increase. Auditory hallucinations, hallucinations, tentacles, or anything else... will appear one by one. They are not purely mental disturbances, but cause real harm to the ontology, which is why Pasha emphasizes that it is not just an illusory thing. Before these effects have caused actual harm, the explorer will not have any serious problems as long as the inspiration is interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if you want to resist this kind of spiritual erosion, it is not something that ordinary people can do. Even a witch who has fought in battle will quickly feel tired and eventually lose control of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but why Roland’s situation is completely reversed, even the black tentacles are heading towards the enemy? This is the first time she has heard of such a thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the mortal king who disapproved of his face, Celine suddenly had an incredible thought. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this ordinary person in the spirit level, and the head of the three seats - the star of the Queen Akaris? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the other party obviously didn’t have this conscious. He smiled after the activity, “But thank you guys for pulling me out, I wanted to see that piece. There is no boundary in the place. As a result, it is a long way to go. I really don't want to return to the original way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
