			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evil beast ran! They all ran!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a cheer in the position The evil beast that originally gathered at the entrance of the passage dissipated like a tidal wave, leaving only a piece of corpse. The machine gunner released the trigger and found that the thumb joint was numb. The barrel that was too late to replace revealed a dark red. According to the shooting regulations, it was obviously scrapped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks so scary, it doesn't matter how it works."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s not as terrible as the gods of the church.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is only a group of beasts.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What do you waffle, beast? You take the hunting bow to compare with them? Three years ago, this thing still disturbed the whole West, and it was changed. It was changed by your majesty, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, yes, captain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Having time to celebrate, change the barrels first, really. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis stood behind the position and looked at the busy and yet orderly first officer, revealing a thoughtful look. Since the army that followed Roland has participated in the tooth-picking operation and the church's blocking war, she has been conceived. If she is to command, what should be done to achieve the highest power of the firearm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, this is a brand new army, and the method of fighting with the Knights and Mercenary Wings is completely different, and you want to forget the previous leader’s charge. It is not an easy task to have a brilliant weapon and a brilliant experience of personal bravery. But when she realized that the Cavaliers could not compete with the new army, she resolutely abandoned the part of her experience and turned to observe it carefully. Every move is made. Under today's actual combat verification, she found that her ideas are basically correct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking feature of firearms is that they can kill opponents with high efficiency in places where the enemy can't reach them, and don't have to consider their own team spacing and physical exertion. Therefore, the narrower the shooting surface, the more intense the firepower, as long as the supply can keep up, it can be played from morning to night without stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only three or four knights on the sidelines of the sideline charge to squeeze the two classes of soldiers, and arrange three machine guns not because they can't put more. Instead, it is limited by the number of machine guns and bullets. Even so, its raging firepower makes it difficult to mix and match – no need to aim, no physical effort, just pull the trigger. When the enemy was too dense, she even saw a thick bloody fog at the hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you switch to a command, you should not be better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that made her unpredictable was the behavior of the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that some of the enemies have the most basic intelligence. When they see that it is difficult to break into the hole, many mixed species begin to linger outside the hole, occasionally called two The sound, but not forward, is like killing other evil beasts. But since they have the ability to think, why do they obey the screaming instructions? The loyalty to the lord is different from that of the lord. There is a relationship between support and protection. The evil beast obviously does not need to maintain such a relationship. As long as it breaks into the wild land, it can live alone, not like human beings. And exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a certain incomprehensible connection between the evil beast and the master of the voice, and this connection is even above survival? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can hardly imagine this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after the expedition, ask Roland’s opinion, Isis thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now no winter city can surprise her, or that it is difficult for her to try to figure out, and only the next person - this is not a character But it means what it thinks. Whenever she talks to him, she always thinks involuntarily about a question: To what extent can people's thoughts be broad? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Isis, this time you really helped a lot..." Brian’s voice interrupted her thoughts and went back and saw this. The young officer’s face is full of gratitude. “When I report to the post-war report, I will definitely report your achievements to my Majesty!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
