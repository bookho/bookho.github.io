			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trial was a couple of days, and in addition to testing Rubik's power to make Roland feel relaxed, another decompression path is the dream world - with a group of Everything is full of curiosity, and there are witches who can never make amazement, no matter what they do, they can make people happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preparing to open a store is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a month and a half of busy work, the Rose Cafe finally ushered in the opening day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to act in a low-key manner, he deliberately chose to cut the ribbon and set off firecrackers after ten o'clock. During this time, the breakfast shop basically closed, and the students and office workers have left the residence. And the aunt and aunt are killing the price in the vegetable market, which can be said to be the quietest moment in the package community. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cafe is located next to the warehouse, a total of two floors, rent for 3,5 months, although it does not sound expensive, but considering the per capita residents of the package area Consumption power, this is already a high price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that Roland doesn’t care if it’s profitable, so it’s not too much to worry about with the landlord. The only requirement is to get through the warehouse and rent the wall, to facilitate the entry and exit of materials, of course When you withdraw your rent, you will fill it back as it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at his one-time payment of one year's rent, the landlord responded with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but these rhetoric are meant to cover the eyes and ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland does not intend to change to business, the Taqila witch certainly has no interest in serving others, so the decoration of the cafe is purely a decoration, not so much The store is better to say that it is a small place for everyone to entertain themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he can, he hopes that it is best not a guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this goal, every drink on the signboard hanging at the door is "high price": for example, two hundred and six cups of latte, three hundred A cup of caramel macchiato. He didn't know that there was a difference between these coffee categories, which was exactly ten dollars according to the price of a certain store. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that a bottle of soy milk next door is only a penny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t believe that someone will visit this “black shop”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the same token, if someone is clear that the slaughter should also come in for consumption, then in all likelihood, it is the "contracted person" on the note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the name of this "Rose" is not counted, and Roland has no bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, is this all right?" Felice put down the ribbon in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, as long as the color is cut, the Rose Cafe is officially open." He nodded. "Go and celebrate with everyone."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushing the door into the house, it is a bar and a few small round tables. Each table is decorated with candlelights and rose vases. Qule, it looks quite like that. But when the two climbed to the second floor, the atmosphere became completely different - rather than a cafe, it would be more appropriate for a small restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland purchased a full set of kitchen utensils and grills for the ancient witch who entered the dream, compared to the beginning, they can only take them to eat Kaifeng and blue road, now not You can also taste a variety of fresh food when you go out. Probably to make up for hundreds of years of regret, and the high-class cuisine brought back from the hotel last time opened the door to the new world, the enthusiasm for cooking is beyond imagination, except for the beginning to learn to use modern cooking appliances such as gas stoves and microwave ovens. It took some time, and after almost no guidance from him, I was able to use my own recipes to learn all kinds of new dishes. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And several of them are extraordinarily talented, and the finished products are quite a few star chefs, although there are some shortcomings in the set and the mosaic. But the control of the knife and the fire is absolutely impeccable, and Felice is one of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I just learned braised squid, would you like to try it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The new grilled loin is coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch’s greetings are endless, and it’s clear that for them, cooking is no less fun than watching a movie or going out to play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a pity that the dream world can’t keep them here. Looking at the lively scene on the second floor, Roland’s heart is a bit regretful, and I learned that Elena’s sacrifice. After the news, he has repeatedly entered the dream, hoping to see each other again here, but neither the warehouse nor the warehouse building has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that sooner or later they will bid farewell to this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s because of war or his death as an ordinary person, it will lead to all these experiences becoming untouchable memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably because of this, they will cherish every time they enter the world of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps... he should also increase the number of sleeps, even if it is not for decompression, as long as they can stay here for a while, it is also a Worth something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“叮叮当当—”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a glimpse of the first floor. Crisp wind ringtones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is suddenly quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, there are guests coming," Felice reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, is it that the accomplices’ response is so fast, and the cafe has just opened the door and came to the door? He made a look at the crowd, "act according to plan." Then went downstairs with Felice - among the ancient witches, only the 76th who had been lurking in "black money" for a while had served others. Experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no one in the bar. Is the purpose of opening this store really to provide a job for the villagers in the village?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two hands holding their chests, their brows are slightly stunned, and they stare at Roland with suspicion. For a moment, he felt that the other person's eyes were examined twice on his cheeks and collars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guest" is Garcia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sighed and opened the café. The other party knew it and could successfully hand over the last tenant. There was also the help of the star martial artist. He nodded to Felice, "two cups of coffee." Then he made a gesture to Jiaxia. "Of course, letting them out of the village has always been my goal."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, I don't plan to drink--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I invite you, don't charge."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiacia sat down. "In any case, the price you hang outside is too exaggerated. It makes it hard to believe the real purpose of your shop. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are wrong," Roland put on a sincere look. "From the countryside to the big cities, the most important thing is to adapt. If the guests flock to Do you think they can work with peace of mind? It’s not bad to be scared. It doesn’t matter if I don’t make money. The key is to give them a space to adapt to the life of a big city. This is what the Rose Cafe is all about.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... is this?" she was dubious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course. I would also like to thank you for your last invitation, which really helped a lot." Roland took the opportunity to change the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the identity problem solved?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than that, the school is arranged, with Jieluo is the same, but they are in the middle school.” He smiled. “The three people always wanted to thank you personally.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s just fine...” Garcia’s expression has become a lot softer. “It’s not necessary to thank you. After all, this is because of your efforts. In order not to give excuses to my father and the media, I have not chosen to stand. Come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head. "It is enough to do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
