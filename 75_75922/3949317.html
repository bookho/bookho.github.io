			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The most elite warrior of the church is also a top-secret weapon against the extraordinary witches," Ashes said. "They have strength and speed that are no less than mine, and ......" She hesitated. "They didn't seem to have any ambitions. When I played, I cut off the right hand of a god punished man, but he did not hesitate to kneel down with my left hand, even though I turned and fled, he The action has not been affected much - it has nothing to do with the will, and even a strong person can maintain his fighting spirit even after breaking his arm, and the balance of losing one arm cannot be adapted in a short period of time."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have only heard of the Judges of the Church," Wendy muttered. "Since they have such a powerful warrior, why haven’t they ever seen the witches?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Ashes said slowly. "Even the name of the Prisoner, which I later returned to the old holy city, was only heard from some people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You...have you gone back?" Wendy was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, how could it be easy to let go of the dregs," she stood up and walked to the window. "I later attacked several chapels and a trial." The military station. There is a presiding judge in the station. I thought they were really not afraid of death." In the face of death and suffering, the other party is not much better than the civilians, it will also show the look of fear. Open for mercy. "From his mouth, I learned the name of the Prisoner. They are all trials that have been transformed through rituals. Only the best warriors can obtain this honor. The conversion must be voluntary, seemingly successful and will. Whether it is firm or not has a great relationship. In other words, the gods are different from the witches. They are not formed naturally or because they are gifted, but they are artificially transformed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"..." Wendy was shocked by the news and could not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess they can't invest in the Prisoners in combat like the Judges, perhaps because of the side effects of the transformation. The lost warrior, in a sense In the end, there is no difference between a monster and a monster.” Gray sighed. “I was hidden under the waterway or deep well during the day. I attacked the church believers at night and was forced to evacuate from the old holy city until the church searched the city. On the day of the walk, the blood on my body glued the clothes and the skin tightly together, and it looked like a beast in the eyes of outsiders. "<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She felt a hand on her shoulder. "It doesn't matter now. You can live here like a normal person. Your Royal Highness is very good for the sisters. I have experienced the demon month and After the attack on the Duke of the fortress, most of the townspeople accepted the existence of the witch. This town is the holy mountain we have been searching for."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman who leaned on the window sill together, Like, the monastic life of children one by one thin emaciated, eyes gray one, can not see the look. And Wendy's current appearance is hard to imagine the way she was when she was a child. Both her body and her appearance are very different from the children of that period, and the gentleness naturally revealed in her tone also makes her feel calm and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some words she must say, "I won't stay here, not for this." She paused, "I want Take you all away and take it to a truly safe place. Bianbu Town is not a place to stay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not here..." Wendy stunned For a moment, "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you live on this continent, you will always be threatened by the church. Tilly has gathered most witches from the Grey Fort Kingdom. Go to the fjord and plan to build a country that belongs to the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can there be a church in the fjord?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of the special features of the archipelago, the islands are separated, their influence can only be maintained between square inches. And..." Ashes curled up their lips, "There is no god punished on the island." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also let them see the witch's thunder anger. An island takes an island and uproots the church, just as they clear the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You and your sisters must leave, Wendy," she continued to persuade. "It is a mistake to rumor and confess my companion. I can hear these messages." The church can also hear it. They will never let a witch organization expand their scale. I don’t think how long it will take for the church’s army to smash you through the gray fort. In the face of the invincible god, you feel Will the Four Princes protect you? No secular lord will be willing to live with the witch. Now he may be good to you, but in times of crisis, he will not hesitate to abandon you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
