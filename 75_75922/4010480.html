			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning straight into the bottom of the balloon, find the explosive bag fixed on the airbag, pull out the delay lead, and see the white smoke after the medicine bag mouth, immediately Falling to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a simple self-destructing device. Once the enemy is looking for it according to the balloon, the tempter must destroy the Yuanwang to avoid the devil’s interest in it, or If you leave the witch and ignore it and concentrate on studying this novelty, the scene will be more embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning just fell to the surface of the sea, and you heard a loud noise - in an instant, the sky seemed to shine a little! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and saw the airbag inflated into a huge red fireball. The center was bright orange, and the dark red clouds were rolling around. The flame continued to count. It took a long time to fade away, like the fallen sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She even saw a devil who was too close to be smashed by the tumbling flames, ignited a fire and fell to the sea with the mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other four shadows came out from under the smoke and rushed toward her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, everything is in the works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil is just that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning raises the corner of the mouth and flies toward the forest in the direction of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to bring them into the depths of the jungle dominated by the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunting grounds have been arranged and are waiting quietly for the prey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dense branches, vines and sawtooth are bound to become enemy nightmares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If they can dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi expands the eye of magic, searches for sloping areas, controlled by leaves The woods glow green and shining. Seen from the sky, like a long-necked bottle embedded in the earth, the mouth of the bottle is facing the whirlpool, and the bottle is far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She resisted a burst of dizziness, sweeping through the interior of each tree, and a huge amount of detail poured into the brain, rising his head and hurting. As he approached the bottle, Sylvia finally found Aegusa, who was hiding in a big tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you?" When McMug just landed, the trunk opened a gap, and Ai Gesha poked her head out. "The lure plan did not Is it successful?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, I’ve chased five devils,” she jumped off the back of the beast and brought up the whitish girl who had recovered as it was, anxiously drilling In the tree, "but three of them are not the same!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it different?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Sylvie sneaked out the weird devil he saw, and then found Aegara's shocked expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart slammed. "Is it difficult to deal with?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter After a long time, I came back to God. I looked ugly and said: "The devils in the robes are the fear of the devil. It is a terrible killer for mortals, but the witches are not afraid of them, just avoid it with their eyes. Depending on the flaws on the face - the scars on the face, the real eyes of the fear are hidden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are the fears... Silvi muttered. In the story of the ancient witches, these devils can directly shock the enemy's soul, causing fear, timidity, confusion and despair. Often, three or four can defeat a mortal army of about 100 people. Many people even resist in extreme panic. The thoughts could not be lifted, and they were kneeling on the ground waiting to be slaughtered by them. Although the stone of divine punishment can greatly weaken this effect, it cannot be completely exempted, and the enemy seems to have the ability to influence the mind by nature, and no obvious magical fluctuations can be observed during the exhibition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The...the armor that can fly alone? Is it the hell lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
