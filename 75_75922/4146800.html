			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the carriage left, Manfred found that as the driver said, no one stayed waiting for him, everyone went all the way, The bustling crowds around are all strange faces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn’t feel too much frustration. It’s not for the sake of gaining gratitude, but because he thinks it’s the right thing to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the information provided by the driver, Manfred quickly found the registration of the Grey Fortress - in fact, the area is not only full of banners, but also Everyone is sipping everywhere, and it’s hard to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the large number of people, the order at the scene is not chaotic, and the railings divide the crowd into a number of folded strands, which seem to be from the entrance to the registration desk. It has been artificially extended a lot, but it also allows people to move forward one by one according to the "road" defined by the railing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was his turn, a gray-washed man dressed by a soldier received him—these outsiders were wearing the same uniform and were very recognizable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Manfred Kastein."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Identity, with or without criminal experience, what are the specialties?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party’s inquiry process and the driver’s office In the same way, Manfred answered truthfully, and everything like the family was taken with him. When the special section was preparing for the details, the soldiers only heard a "can read and write" and then interrupted. He, "Okay, go to the No. 6 trestle on board. This is your registration number plate, don't lose it. Next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not yet When I came back, I was squeezed out of the team and entered the dock area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃... is this all right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it really like the coachman said that just literacy can be mixed in the gray fortune? However, looking at the situation in front of the registration desk, it seems that I would like to pull a gray castle, I know how to read and write text? When he was waiting in line, Manfred noticed that the group of recorders had changed for several rounds. Sometimes even the soldiers who were temporarily looking for supervision order responded, and there was no such thing as a scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation made him quite confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the brand that the Grey Fortress gave him seemed to hide the mystery - it turned out to be an iron card with a twine on one end, which can be worn around the neck. necklace. The sign is engraved with a series of symbols, probably related to the number at the time of his registration. It takes a few dollars to find a blacksmith to find a blacksmith, but if it is extended to the entire migrant group, it is not the same thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kastan’s family territory used to have a blacksmith shop, and he naturally knew what it meant. An iron plate can be made with the scrap left by the iron, but one hundred and one thousand can't; the symbol is enough for half a day, and it can be repeated a hundred times, a thousand times, and the time will become quite long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many people on the pier? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Shenchi Bay is such a scene every day, tens of thousands are going down! And for all the migrants are prepared for such a registration card? The materials and time needed are beyond his imagination, and he is afraid that the blacksmiths who gather all the wolves can't do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light is this, let him feel the richness and luxury of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that this title should belong to the morning kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this feeling, Manfred boarded a three-masted sea boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if it’s a special relationship. He was assigned to a ten-person cabin, which is much better than the expected sleep warehouse. Even so, the rich smell of the cabin still makes him unbearable, and even if the family is lonely, at least it can guarantee a comfortable bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So only stayed for a while, and he escaped with awkwardness. Just as he was about to go to the deck, Manfred suddenly heard a slight cry for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there were not many people boarding the ship. The sailors were also busy on the upper level. The entire cabin looked a little empty. No one except him heard this call for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred did not hesitate to walk towards the source of the sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end is a solid utility room, except for the crew, I am afraid that few people will come to this place. He put his ear on the door with a light hand, and he heard some strange noises, like who is struggling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decisively stepped back two steps, slammed his shoulders and slammed into the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene in front of him makes Manfred a glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man standing in the utility room is actually an acquaintance on the carriage, the one who walks along and laughs at his stupid middle-aged aristocrat. Two of his followers were pressing the two women on the ground, trying to tie their hands and feet with a rope. The woman’s mouth was stuffed with a pile of linen, and it was only able to make a low-pitched voice, apparently they were forcibly brought here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Isn’t this a fool who is a fair person?” The nobility is not flustered. "If I didn't guess wrong, you should also be a nobleman." Right? My name is Mai Jinli, what about you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Manfred Kastan.” This is Manfred’s third day. Name on the second report. Moreover, he noticed that when he said his identity, the woman’s eyes that had just lighted up were extinguished, and even the extent of the struggle was much smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kastan? I haven't heard of it." The other shrugged. "But you are lucky, since you have met, let you play." - But I have to be behind me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let them." Manfred sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha?" Mai Jinli’s eyes narrowed. "Are you having a problem? Do you know who they are? Slaves! And don't know I used to think that I was wrong. I didn’t expect to encounter these two small things on the boat. As far as I know, their owners can’t let them go, so the conclusion is very simple. They escaped without authorization. Even so, do you still need to protect them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape from slavery is the lowest kind, It is almost the same as a livestock, and no matter what the aristocracy does, it will not be blamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but as he said before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone is like this, it doesn't mean it's correct."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This ship The destination is Grey Fort, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What do you want to say?" Mai Jinli sullenly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The promotion of the Grey Fortress must have been heard, and the Wimbledon royal family has cancelled slavery, so from the moment they boarded the ship, they It is no longer a slave." Manfred did not give up. "And don't forget, there is still a round of review after disembarkation, including criminal experience. If I say it, do you think that the Grey Fortress would have happened as if it had not happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "If I have to continue?" asked each other biting a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So win me first." Manfred picked up his sleeves, "I am a knight-"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice has not fallen, Mai Jinli has already rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle quickly broke out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other's bodyguards have obviously practiced. In the small utility room, Manfred failed to support ten strokes and lost the power to fight back. When he had a bruised face, Mai Jinli did not forget to make up his feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still want to be handsome with this skill? I thought that your skill is as powerful as your mouth." The middle-aged aristocrat snorted, "Mom's I have completely ruined the interest of Laozi. Since you like to protect these two goods, let them be good. But don't forget, slaves are slaves, no matter where they are everywhere! It’s really awkward to meet such a fool, we Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
