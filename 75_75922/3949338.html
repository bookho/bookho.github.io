			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred martial art conversion ritual is the knowledge that the Pope must master. When Mayn took over the sacred texts from O'Brien's hand, it was quite a year ago. Obtained the qualification of the next pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the book, Mayn has long been full of enthusiasm, a god of the penalty army needs to sacrifice the life of a witch, the fusion of her blood and the stone of punishment And then inject into the trial army. This set of rituals has been improved several times in hundreds of years of use, but the essence has not changed. The witch is the upper limit of the number of gods. The will of the trial army is the key to determining the success rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading this book, he understood why the church accommodates so many underage women every year. There are no signs of the emergence of witches. Before the magic gathers, they are no different from normal people. Once the magic begins to gather, their bodies, organs, and blood will be changed. Therefore, apart from expanding the scale of breeding, there is no other way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why he agrees with Heather’s statement that everything they have done is already extremely evil, and every high-level hand is covered with blood. The witches of the slaughter are more than any of the executioners. But in order to defeat the devil, in order to avoid the destruction of mankind, they must do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The winner is qualified to receive the favor of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two trials were lying on the conversion table, and Mayn knew them, respectively It was the first camp of Da Lien and the Tucker of the Holy City Guard, who was also a presiding judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although both of them smile, the bishop can still see the tension from their tight muscles and clenched fists. He patted the shoulders of the two men. "Let's relax, I believe you can do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, just wait for the pain to be good? Daley couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s fine," Mayn laughed. "You are Daly, right."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You actually remember my name," he said excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, you are a member of the first camp, participated in the last year's Hermes defense, the captain is... Eleania, I am not "Well right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right," Dalyen nodded in a row. "Our team suffered heavy casualties in a battle. Half of the players died from mixed evil. The hand of the beast, I thought at the time, if I had the ability to kill the group of deformed hybrids, so, adults, I want to be a god fine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Being strong to protect your comrades, this belief is very good," Mayn encouraged, and then he looked to the presiding judge, "So what about you? Tucker Thor, for what decision is converted into divine punishment." "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to defend the new holy city, adults," he said firmly, "the priests said that the evil beast will become stronger every year. The last time they have touched the wall of the holy city, if it is not the gods, the cathedral may have been destroyed. I also want to be a shield and pierce against the evil beast. The enemy's long gun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, you are all the pride of the church," Mayn explained the tension and fear with conversation in accordance with the steps of the classics. Seeing that the two people's emotions gradually became high, he waved his hand and signaled the ceremony to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards covered the eyes of both of them and fixed the limbs on the conversion table with the ring and the ankle. Then the witch was hugged in and laid flat between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a witch raised by the church, she spent most of her life in the old holy city monastery. After she was awakened, she was sent to the secluded area and waited as a material. Conversion. The day before the sacrifice, she has been flooded with a lot of dream water – a herb made from sleeping pills and winter flowers, ensuring that no noise in the ceremony will wake her up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Number, Age?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No.1, 18 years old." The guard replied . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a routine inquiry, only the blood of the adult witch is enough to meet the needs of the two gods, and Mayn confirms the correctness of the witch list and announces The ceremony begins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the stone of God's punishment changed. It can be seen through the side of the basin that the blue stone is absorbing blood. After about half an hour, the stone gradually melts away, the turbid blood becomes crystal clear, and the color is transformed from reddish brown to sky blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These operations seem simple, but after tens of thousands of trials, they get a complete and reliable set of steps. For example, the witch estimates the blood volume of different ages and body shapes, the production of silver needles and skin tubes, which part of the body is inserted into the blood, and which part of the blood is inserted, and the quality and weight of the stone of the gods are selected. The trials and improvements of previous failures also illustrate the general principles of transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the witch's body is transformed by magic, its blood is accompanied by the ability to strengthen organs and tendons. If used directly, it will only kill the recipient in an instant. The stone of the gods must be soaked in the blood of the witch, and the "unknown power" must be dispelled before it can be injected into the transformant. Even so, the blood will damage the mind and gradually lose its emotion. And intelligence, in the end, only instinct and part of the strong will. The surviving gods of the penalty force are equivalent to the extraordinary, and they can have the magical effect when they do not wear the stone of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that this is a wonderful combination, the blood of the witch can kill humans, and the stone that swallows the gods will also kill people. The combination of the two can minimize this undesirable effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the blue liquid slowly flows into the two trials along the skin tube, the blue ribs on their arms and neck suddenly rise and their expressions look like It is a great pain to endure. Da Lien took the lead and shouted. He struggled on the stage. The five fingers clenched and opened, but his hands and feet could not move. After a while, a thin layer of sweat appeared. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tucker is not much better. He sends out a low-pitched voice, a squirt of blood from his mouth, and his body twitches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liquid level in the crystal basin slowly drops. When the bottom is approaching, Da Lien’s voice has turned into a crying, and he shouts out unclear words, skin It melted and dissolved, and it was white smoke. Judging from the description on the classics, his transformation is basically on the verge of failure. When Mayn hesitates to observe again, the Pope holds his shoulder from behind. "Enough, let him free."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guard came forward and took out his short sword, slamming into the neck of Dalyen, and twisting the hilt, ending his pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a difficult wait, Tucker’s convulsion subsided, his breathing gradually stabilized, and his skin was rosy to light blue. Mayn knows that he has passed the transformation ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person succeeds, one person fails, and this result makes the Lord sigh. In just two quarters of an hour, the church loses a devout trial army. At the same time, half of the blood of the witch was wasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then there are still six judges waiting for the conversion, he must let the ritual continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the ceremony is completed, Mayn is almost unable to stand, he Walking down the stage, sitting near the wall of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope slowly passed over and stood in front of him. "To tell the truth, your performance surprised me, child. When I first hosted the ceremony." I was much worse than you. I was exactly forty-five years old that year, and the strong bloody smell made me spit out directly on the ceremonial table, almost wasting a whole pool of blood. The former pope even smoked me. After the meal was over, he went on to order me to return to the stage and continue to preside over the ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Mayn opened his mouth, but not Know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, don't think about anything, go back and take a day off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, 冕Next." The bishop took a deep breath, and when he was preparing to leave, he suddenly remembered the purpose of coming. "Yes, you called me to the secret area for..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, look at me," Oberlin shook his head in mockery. "I am looking for you to give you a new poison developed by the agency."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poison?" In the secret area of ​​the agency, there are institutions that specialize in the study of the stone of the gods, such as the cold-blooding pills, fluorescent stones, mad drugs, etc. Used by the bishop. But I have never heard of them involved in poison. In Mayn’s impression, this should be what the alchemists are good at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
