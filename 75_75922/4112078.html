			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anpein suddenly stayed in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the accident many years ago was the deliberate scam created by Count Quinn in order to cover up the news that her daughter became a witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia is the evil fallen man...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those murderers who murdered his father and harassed the kingdom all day long were indeed witches. If they did not have such unreasonable abilities, nothing would change. It looks like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea that he wants to avenge his father... is it wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two thoughts collided and bite in the mind of Ampein, causing him to burst into a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your rule is here," Count Quinn stepped forward. "No matter what, the morning dawn should not continue to follow your will. They will be rehabilitated and have the same status and rights as ordinary people. They can walk on the streets normally, can serve as official positions, inherit the family, and even manage the kingdom." Here he looked at Andrea, "as for You-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, do you want to kill a royal family?" Anpein rubbed his forehead and said, "You forgot." For the vows of the ancestors, have you forgotten my last name! Answer me, Horford Quin!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sharp question is in the presence Everyone can't help but take a step back – except for Andrea and the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the direct bloodline of the royal family of Moya, and the only inheritor! Even if I am no longer a king, you will bear the name of the Shangjun. He whispered, "The order of the morning will be destroyed in your hands, and the great aristocratic family will not trust you again!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not Will do that," Horford sighed. "If it wasn't for the family, I don't even want to go to this day. But you must swear - leave the Dawn Kingdom forever, and never step into the land of the kingdom in your lifetime. If you can bring someone who can take it away from the kingdom, otherwise I can only lock you in the dungeon of the castle, just like you did for the parents of Losey."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the decision made by all three of you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Tokat family has no objection to this." Earl Tokat Breast care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The same is true for Losey." Earl Rossi approached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are not as cold and bloodless as you are," Oro Tokat snorted. "It’s also a step later than your order, otherwise..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay," Otto interrupted him. "Don't say it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp It’s really a group of people who are considerate of each other, but how long can your ridiculous friendship last in the face of the huge difference in power? Anpei glanced at the nobility in the hall coldly, and said only after a long silence, "I chose the former."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't be imprisoned in a never-ending day The place, as long as the blood is continuous, he will always be the royal family of the morning sun, whether you go to the wolf heart or the winter, you can get the same treatment. Even if you are under the fence, it is better than being held in a cage. Moreover, no matter whether it is Horford Quinn or the king of the Grey Fort, it is impossible to guarantee that he will not make mistakes. Once the dispute arises, the nobles of other territories will certainly not forget his existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So... please swear." Count Quinn nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Anpein Moya swears in the name of the ancestor, the incident finally comes to an end. However, only Andrea was noticed in the audience. When the guards took the Lord of the Dawn out of the hall, she helped her with her sneer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the castle, Otto suddenly stopped Andrea from behind, "Quiet, Miss Quinn... Thank you for saving me. No winter. Mr. Hill has told me about what happened in the city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No... I am just--" Otto appeared a bit confusing for a moment, but there was a touch of joy in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call a big sister!" Oro stepped forward to his neck. "Don't forget who was the head of the four-person team at that time. Or do you want this guy to be awkward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oro!" Otto hit an elbow on the chest of the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, well, look at you too nervous, just kidding..." Oro put on a slammed expression, "but that's it." I haven't seen it for a long time, now the flower of the glow is resurrected, and it must be gathered at night. How about the old place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Antler Tavern?" Andrea replied, "Isn't that place still closed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, it’s the business of Losey’s family, not so fast, although it’s operating It is really bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have no problem."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's good, I will take a step first, and you will talk slowly." Oro waved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An, Andrea..." Otto took a deep breath. "I want to talk to you alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don’t know why old friends would be willing to give up this opportunity to get along with each other, it is a rare opportunity for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t want to borrow the words of Oro’s mouth to think of it, but also feels that Andrea’s attitude is a little bit when he meets without Winter City. change. Although she still seems to be quite resistant to the identity of Miss Quin's family, at least for her former playmates, she did not show a strange feeling, which can be seen from the joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Andrea seemed to think for a little while, then nodded. "Let's go to the courtyard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto felt his heart pounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supporters did not follow, and the two walked into the courtyard one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... are you okay?" Looking at the walking, there are some shaking witches, Otto wants to help but dare not reach out, obviously when I was young, these The move is always a matter of course. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just a sequel to the overuse of magic. It has no real impact on the body. Instead, we have to use it to increase the magic capacity and wait until the next day to recover. As early as, don't worry.” Andrea shrugged. “Now we are both, what do you want to talk about?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto bites his lip, “Remember what I said to you when there was no winter city? Oro will go to your graveyard to give flowers every year...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Remember.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I still have one sentence that I didn't tell you," he took a deep breath. "I will do the same every year - because I can't forget you. When I saw you saying "I am coming" in prison, I could hardly describe the joy of my heart. At that moment, I decided. In any case, I have to say this. Andrea, can you stay here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia didn't seem to be surprised. She only smiled slightly. "Thank you, but you said it was too late." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too late means..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I already have a desire to spend People, so... I won't stay in the Glow City. "She deliberately replied in a brisk tone. "If you said it for ten years, I might have promised." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto has a glimpse of it, "Is it Roland?" If it were him, it was indeed a much better choice than me -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I be an enemy of the nightingale," Andrea interrupted. "I am her most determined ally. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
