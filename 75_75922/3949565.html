			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah... I am so envious of Nana," the mysterious moon wiped the wet hair and put the face in front of Lily sitting at the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." The latter did not return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't ask me what envy her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Anyway, you will be right away Said," Lily grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abominable!" Mystery month muttered, but in the end I couldn’t help but say, "You didn't see the soldiers guarding the hospital and the nearby townspeople. How is it for her?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Hello Nanawa," "Miss Angel, are you leaving?", "Miss Pine, this is my own made oatmeal." "...I want to be treated like this!" "Mystery Month put his face on Lily's cheek and was pushed away mercilessly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was her ability to exchange," Lily did not move Suddenly, "You didn't find the demon moon coming, she stayed in the hospital almost every day, waiting to treat the wounded." Half of the town's aborigines have received her help, and the rest are basically the families of the recipients. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too exaggerated. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not at all," Lily sighed and put down her book. "Although not everyone will go to the wall to fight the evil beast, but the wounded to the town residents." This is a normal thing - the miners are smashed by the ore to the toes, the kiln workers are burnt, and the apprentices in the steam engine factory and the chemical laboratory are even more so. "She paused." His Royal Highness once said to me that Nana and I are the cornerstones of Bianbuzhen's medical care. One of the main and the other is the main one, so that everyone can still maintain a healthy health system. High-intensity work. In fact, apart from the epidemic prevention of new refugees, I have not done anything else. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you are envious of her, just like me!" "Mystery month is coming back without hesitation.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't! She screamed. "Besides staying away from me, you are hindering me from reading." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜..." Mystery month shrank his head. "But I really envy her." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let’s learn from Nana Va, take the initiative to help every town, until they know you, get to know you, and wherever they go, everyone will say hello It is. Lily shrugged.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I don't have the power of her," the mystery month is frustrating.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If you don't have the ability, you can rely on physical strength," Lily sneered. "In the case of the camp, you come over like this." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... Despicable! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you go back to bed, the mystery month is still in your arms, even though you know what the other person said is true, but you feel like you are in the Witch Alliance. The middle and low class waited. And she did not continue to follow this way, and finally found a place to deal with the peace of mind, all day doing nothing to make her feel uneasy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Almost a night without sleep, the next day, the mysterious moon with a pair of dark circles ringed the door of the Roland office.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened? The prince asked strangely, "Is it bullied?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Being Lily... No, nothing," she slammed to Roland's table. "His Highness, don't you say that I have great potential?" Why haven’t my abilities changed so far? Can’t I really understand the basics of the natural sciences? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be the case," the other party couldn't help but laugh out. "Actually... I have been thinking about this issue." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the problem? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ai Gesha did not say it? More than 400 years ago, the Federation witches could still experience high-level awakening even if they had a systematic understanding of the world. In addition to relying on continuous practice as the basis, the rest is epiphany - this can be triggered by the observation of real phenomena, or by accidental opportunities. Roland said, "But the resulting awakening is obviously less than the evolution of understanding after systematic learning." The magic of Aisha is proof that it is not only the lowest of the witches in evolution, but even more ordinary witches, such as Sylvie and Andrea. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
