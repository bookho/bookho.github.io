			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is Jinsuicheng?" The iron axe turned the lookout mirror and looked at the city where the gray and brown were seen in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As shown on the map, it should be it. After all, there is only one Sanwan River, and it is unlikely to be in the wrong direction." The adjutant Xiongjia returned. Like the iron axe, he was born in the border town of Orion, and he was the first person to work for the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a bit strange..." He frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Golden Spike is the main city in the east, too A large trade center of the Grey Fort, the old Wangdu, the Eagle City, and the Jinsui City, all constitute the prosperous central region of the kingdom, and even I have heard its name when I was in the extreme south." Iron Axe explained, "But these days, come down, don't you think that the merchant ships we met are pitiful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," the bear's palm shrugged. "Probably the previous pirate attack scared the merchants and dared to come here to buy and sell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The attack was already two years ago The matter, no matter how serious the looting at that time, it should be restored."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls in the field of vision are ugly and bloated, and the brown walls seem to Deliberately widened, perhaps lack of stone, the new exterior wall is made of red mud, which is also mixed with a lot of gravel and wood, quite like the early Maoshi wall in Bianbu Town. In addition, the surface of the wall is covered with a layer of shiny things. Because of the distance, the iron axe is not very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new old city walls are stacked together, making the width of the wall top more than twice the width, but the transformation is not very thorough, some parts are still the original Looks like it looks rough and sloppy from afar, it is not like a city known for its richness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take him, just take it," the bear's paw took a fire lantern from his arms and threw it into his mouth. "Even if it is not gold." Suicheng, but what about Yin Suicheng and Tie Sui City, the command of His Majesty is to sweep the entire East. Isn’t it right? So it’s very simple, see one hit one.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe shook his head helplessly, this guy is still the same as before, thinking time is rarely more than three interest, the most common thing to do with the goal is to carry the javelin straight. While other hunters are still laying traps and releasing hounds to track their prey, he has returned with the results of the hunt. According to legend, even the most terrible black bear in the forest is not willing to provoke him too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is willing to move his mind, he will not be an adjutant now, even the guy of Fanna is the chief conductor of the artillery battalion. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the battle process is not the focus, the focus is on how to be rehabilitated," but the next thing in the bear's paw makes the iron axe feel a little surprised, "If we put The east side is a mess, and the City Hall will definitely find us trouble, but if you don't make a big move, it will be difficult for the officials to stand still. How can you act if you have to explain it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No, he only told me to look at the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That can be a headache. Of course, you are the boss, this is a natural matter. I will give you consideration, I will do as I can." The bear's paw whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Axe couldn’t help but have an interest, “Oh? Where is the headache?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You are I really don't know if I am still testing me." The bear's paw is holding the forehead. "Of course, it is a headache. How do you deal with those nobles? The East has insisted that it has not waited for the turn of the moment, but the strength of the arm is becoming stronger and stronger. There will be only one voice. When the time is down, the majority of people will surrender, and then the trouble will come. There is no nightingale, how do you tell them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Continue," the iron axe nodded, and it seemed that the other party was not completely brainless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you won’t really think about it," said the bear’s paw. The number of the Eastern Army is not much, and the team that can stay behind Very limited, at most, I care about an inner city, but here is the base of Tefko! After the survivors surrendered, they are willing to cooperate fully with us. Fortunately, if they are happy, they always want to seize power? Even if there is only a handful Such a person can also make the east side uneasy - waiting for the army to leave, the city hall is a trivial matter. If it is serious, the officials sent by the city hall may not be able to survive. Poisoning, assassination, buying... ...these means are not rifle-proof."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Boss, this is your business," the bear's palm rolled his eyes and spit the chewed fruit seeds into the tumbling river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Assume it, for example, now you are the commander of the Eastern Front, just talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔..." The other person thought for a while and then sighed. "There is no good way. If the nightingales can’t come, they can only rely on time to distinguish. Or buy more. Some mice, do a good job of prevention, and then follow the method of no winter city, get a police team to maintain order, use as few people as possible to surrender the nobility, and drag it to the end of the war."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough..." The iron axe whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, nothing," he closed the lookout mirror, "here Without your business, to inform other people on board, prepare for landing, we are close to the outskirts of the suburbs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!" The bear's paw immediately came to the spirit. "Floating on the river for so long, I can finally do it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the back of the adjutant, leaving the back, iron The axe spit out the gas and leaned over to the porthole of the command room, thinking thoughtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his mind, he couldn’t help but emerge from the day before the army opened the day, when Isis talked to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place to meet in the pub room opened by Evelyn, it is not like a place to talk about business, the iron axe originally thought that the other party intends to defend the Ministry of Defense The identity, I wish the victory of this action, by the way, the feelings of the army, but did not expect that there is only one North Pearl in the private room, and the things said are enough to shock the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the conversation between the two people happens to be the "headache" of the bear's paw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every word that the other party said, he still remembers clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do you think that you will be responsible for the Eastern Army?" Itis's opening remark made him quite surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only obey the order, not to ask why."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the order is not Every detail will be clearly explained, especially in some things that are not convenient to mention," Beidi Pearl said in an orderly manner while chasing a chaotic drink. "The answer in your heart is because you are apart from you." No one else can be responsible, but is this really the case? What is the strength of the group in Dongjing? You should know better than me. Any regular army of five or six hundred people can destroy them. In other words, the commander at the battalion level is enough to deal with the war on the Eastern Front. On the contrary, the West Line has to deal with the holy city of Hermes, not only in complicated situations, but also in much greater potential danger. If it is not a special reason, let you assist It’s a good idea to command the West Line Army and hand over the Eastern Line Army to other talents.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...” At that time, the iron axe did not answer, but the heart was faint I agree with the statement of Itis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As for this special reason, it is actually very simple, that is your attitude towards the nobility." The other party went on to say, "You are a Mojinshamin, and There will be no inexplicable fear and tolerance for the Grey Fort nobles, and the key to regaining the East is how to deal with the rebellious nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After her analysis and The words that bear's paw said are roughly the same, but they are much more meticulously detailed - the iron axe can't help but believe that it is impossible to return the east to stability by ordinary methods alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for population and resources, and there is not much time spent on a group of dregs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is... "There is no such confession."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not Yes, my Majesty is the Lord of Mercy, after all, so there are some things we can only do," Itis said slowly. "But he is not all without hints. The City Hall has sent a total of 265 people. Walking with the military, they are all managers who have been trained to take over the land that needs to be recovered. The Eastern Army accounts for more than two-thirds of the total number. You should be able to understand why." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
