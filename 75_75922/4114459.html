			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is now able to go ashore..." Roland was very excited. "I remember you said that she chose to stay in the sea, very long. "I have not been in contact with humans for some time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanks to the help of His Royal Highness and Ms. Carmela," Margaret sighed back. If I don't rely on the ability to communicate directly with consciousness, I am afraid she can't adapt to the normal life now. And Joan has completely forgotten how to talk. The Thunder adult has found several bachelors for her, but the effect is not satisfactory. Now she is still only Can speak a small number of words, even a complete conversation can not be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of this, the businesswoman paused for a moment, it seems that some words and stops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if some of her parts have become different from humans because of the long-term transformation," Margaret bit. Biting my lips, "In my understanding of witches, when they don't use magic, they should be no different from ordinary people. But Joan can't go back to her previous appearance, her cheeks, neck, arms and legs are all long. The blue-blue scales are just like those of the sea ghosts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland immediately thought of Luo Jia’s long ears, oh...the scales of the skin seem to have something to do. The customs - cough, not right, now is not the time to consider this problem, even the ears of the mad flame three princesses that are harmless to humans and animals can be tabooed by the sand people, Joan's situation is estimated to be even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Someone maliciously hurt her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We tried to prevent it, but it is still inevitable Will spread the news." Margaret sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you want to teach her to adapt to human life, we can't avoid contact with others," Thunder's voice is quite helpless. "I can accept her." Even in the fjord is a small number - since she received her from the house, she has scared away three maids, two bachelors. Even some people even said that I have raised a sea ghost in the house, perhaps the sea is more suitable She."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If my friend hates life on land, I will naturally not let her stay on the island," the businesswoman said. From the process of Joan's contact with other people, she does not hate this change. Although it takes a few hours to soak in the sea every week, she is also happy to get along with the maids who accept her, and compared to the previous raw food. Fish, she now prefers to cook and eat again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this environment is limited to the Thunder’s mansion - Roland understands the other’s meaning, but I can't think of any good way at the moment. Changing the mindset is a long process, especially for Joan. Even her problems are more serious than the vulva, and the animalization, deformity, or inhuman appearance has been the object of discrimination and rejection for a long time in history. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It will always get better," he can only comfort. "Can you let me see her look up close?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the problem is really serious, then it can only be masked first—for example, like Luo Jia’s ear, wearing a hat is basically the same as ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," said Margaret in the direction of Joan, waving, "Dear, come to me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the latter just took a look at the head and then hid it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...陛, sorry, she may not be used to the scenes of so many people," Margaret said embarrassedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you are scared of her," the nightingale succumbed to the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland squinted at the open space beside him, coughing two channels, "No matter, anyway, she will stay in the winter city for a while, always get used to it." Let's go to the dock first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build a steel ship, Roland Deliberately in the southwest corner of the shoal, a piece of nearly 100 acres of open space was drawn, and the lotus raised the earth wall around it, forming a barrier to block the line of sight. Not only the four corners are equipped with sentinels, but also the first army is stationed on the wall. Therefore, apart from the construction workers, not many people know what it is like to gather the big ships without the top industrial level of the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
