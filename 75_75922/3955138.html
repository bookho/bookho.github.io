			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was already bright when he got up from the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put on his coat and walked to the window, the white buildings have revealed their respective backgrounds, and the red tile gray walls are mixed together to form a kind Rich in variegated colors. Although the interior is still very cold, but in the face of the sun, you can feel a little warmth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is snowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the study room of the study, the table is today with breakfast, a fried egg and two pancakes, plus a cup of hot water, and in the town At the same time, it is obviously the nightingale to help yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," Roland said to the empty lounge chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you know that I am here?" The figure of the nightingale gradually emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can't sit when you can lie down," he smiled, pinching the two pancakes to the mouth, "and the back of the chair." I’m stuck, I don’t know if I have a ghost.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, I like it when I sit,” she said, and she appeared straight at the desk and turned over. Sit on the edge of the table, "Like here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of movements is always in the air, Roland wants, especially the process of breaking into the fog and then coming out It is like a transition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You look good and have a good dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked the pick Eyebrows, "Well, it's a good dream."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Roland swallowed "egg burger" a few times. "Today you have Follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the assassination?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," he was in the mood." One condensation, "If it is really a "gem list" that has been activated by Feike, there may be other dark chess in the West, and we can't review everyone. "Those who are loyal to the royal family and have the courage to do so should not be wasting the assassination. They could have put themselves in a more promising position to exert their abilities. Thinking of this, Roland further strengthened the eradication of the Tiffany forces." The determination.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As you wish, Your Highness," said the nightingale, "Where is the trip today?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pore and salt wells, this is one of the main purposes of my visit here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After recruiting Peor and a related person to the castle, the team was inspected It’s a great way to go outside the city.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Roland is more concerned about the iron ore mines in Maple Leaf and Wild Rose, the gem trade is also a long song area. The pillar industry, and also the closest to the fortress, so the first stop of the inspection was placed on this famous five-color gem mine.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the snow As a result, the ground became muddy and the carriage could not pass. The pedestrians could only travel slowly on horseback. It took most of the morning time to reach the edge of the desolate mountains. Roland once again believed the truth of "want to be rich, to build roads first". There is no hard road leading to the mining area. Once it rains, it is impossible to transport the ore smoothly. The high output is useless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vein is located in a natural cave. After a short passage, the interior is suddenly open. Nearly a hundred rosin torches can only be seen in the cave. Take a photo. Roland raised his head and looked around and asked, "Is this cave naturally formed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness," Pedro nodded, "rumored It was also an accident: it was originally a smooth rock wall. There was a shock in the earth more than three hundred years ago, and the rock wall collapsed, revealing the current hole. At first, the local hunters only used this place as a shelter from the rain. The place, and then with the deepening of exploration, discovered the existence of five-color gemstones."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know it very clearly," Roland laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
