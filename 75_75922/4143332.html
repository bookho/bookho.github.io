			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf Heart, Shen Chi Wan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the only two harbour cities in the Wolfheart Kingdom, the marina area is always busy. Every day, there are many inland traders who sell their goods to Shanghai for sale to other countries, or exchange their own needs directly from the sea merchants. Therefore, the dock area is quite like a big market, from fur to slaves. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White is sitting bored in his own carriage, listening to the labor of the car, while looking at the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the battle between Hermes and the Grey Fort, the mission of sending orphans to the Holy City from all over the church has also been suspended, and he lost the biggest extra income. The days are a lot sad. But even worse, the kingdom order that was overthrown by the church did not recover because of the end of the war. The local lords had small conflicts. The coachman who relied on the car dealership to live a life basically lost a stable source of income and had to Come to Shenchi Bay to find a new business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the prosperity here has been affected to some extent, it is good for the lords to fight for the right to fight for power, and the pursuit of enjoyment has not fallen. In addition, the main road crossing the cage mountain is controlled by the Token family, and the luxury goods that other lords want are more dependent on shipping, so that the city still maintains the pre-war prosperity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is also related to the insistence that the baron of Shenchiwan is always neutral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White has a stable consideration in choosing this place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is older and he no longer wants to travel around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After pulling a few times, you can buy a house in a foreign city. When you do a small business, you should be able to survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle, haven’t you been alive today?" Suddenly a young worker laughed and climbed into his car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go and go, I won’t take care of you," White waved like a fly, "Don’t just go to my car. You can't afford to wear the wheel axle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say that, I only have more than the goods. I will know here." After taking the open belly, I lie down in the compartment, picking up the straw at the bottom of the roots and licking it in my mouth. I looked around in the circle. "What was your last shipment? How do you have a sour smell?"<br / > <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ". you do not go, I'm going to beat you," White snappily said, this guy has no name, other workers called him Dodger, do not know where the clever . The two have no relationship, they are all busy at one dock and have had several face-to-face meetings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On your own, it’s a painful leg that can’t stand on a rainy day?” The other party was full of disappointment. “It’s going to rain again. Is your bone now faintly painful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White can't help but hold, this nasty little devil, when is it -<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't stare at me like you want to eat people, but I will help you find a job." The ghost spirit is a handkerchief. "A ship has so much cargo to ship. When you are old, you can't squeeze people, and you earn less."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you want to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's very simple, my brothers can help you to seize the position, it is much more useful than you alone, are you interested?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Hey, you will not be busy." White shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The freight is 10%, it is fair." The ghost smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was silent for a while. At this time, the sky at the top of the head was a bit gloomy, and the sea breeze blew the horn of the clothes. Obviously a heavy rain was coming. If there is a ship arriving at the port at this time, it is really difficult for him to grab business from the rest of his peers - the fake leg is both a hindrance and a reason for the employer to screen him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that he did not answer, the clever ghost made a snap. "If you don't refuse, then I will agree."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, if everyone can line up, we can save a lot of things, isn't it?" The spirit of the ghost is a little bit past, "I said Uncle, can you change the straw into a cloth mat? The most valuable goods in the Bay are perfumes in addition to the chaotic drinks in the fjord. Although they buy nobles, they usually bring their own carriages, but no one will encounter an accident, there will always be time to add a car. And you This car is stinky, even if we help you get a good position, the employer will not necessarily agree..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who swept the eye White suddenly realized that the other person was called a clever ghost, but he was not a vegetarian when he was alive. "Right, haven't you asked me what I pulled back last time?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Pulling cow dung, used to burn wood," he said slowly. "Although it has been dried, it is normal to leave some residue after the moisture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a stiff face, mouth turned straw discharge, cough up lying on the frame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut, after all, it’s a hairy devil. White snorted with his nostrils and looked at the sea again, then squatted in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few three-masted sea boats appeared at the end of the field of view and are slowly coming towards Shenchi Bay. Each ship is a flagship ship of the Fiordland Chamber of Commerce. The main raft is close to ten feet. The dome is covered with the flag of the black side of the gold, and that is not the flag of the Chamber of Commerce that he is familiar with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But manage him, as long as there is a ship, there is business, and which one is not pulling? And once you come to three ships, even if you don't find these workers to help, he should be able to receive one or two cars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he turned down the frame, untied the ropes two or three times, and was preparing to take the mount to the unloading area, the clever ghost suddenly reached out and grabbed him. Clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey... It seems that something is wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can be wrong, White does not Turning his head to the ground - and this hope made him stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the three sea-going vessels, there are still many ships that are showing up a little, and the raised sails are faintly connected, forming a "sea" White wall." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My God..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a gray-black hull enters the field of vision Almost covering the original appearance of the sea, White also tried to figure out how many ships came to the ship, but after counting to fifty, he found that his eyes could not keep up with the speed of the ship. hundred? Two hundred... No, I am afraid there will be much more! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many huge three-masted ships, but more are white-boated paddle steamers - for this new type of sailless ship, He has seen it occasionally, but now it is so much more than he imagined. He vowed that even if he was a sailor living in Hong Kong, he had never seen such a huge fleet! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other people in the harbour also noticed this incredible scene, whether it was a trader, a sailor or a worker, they couldn’t help but let go of their work and watched the mighty fleet Approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original noisy dock was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ship approached, the flying flag became clearer--on the bottom of the gold, White faintly saw the emblem of the tower lance. All the seagoing vessels are hoisted with the same banner. When hundreds of flags are welcoming the wind and forming a new sea-air antenna, anyone can feel the majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirited ghost sucked a cold breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this the king of the gray castle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White is incredulously Muttered, "You mean... the king of the gray castle, come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Shenchi Bay can’t stop so many big ships, most of them The ships all sailed down the port, while the ten steamships drove straight into the port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just landed, a group of people wearing the same color uniforms rushed out from the springboard, quickly assembled on the trestle into a series of regular teams, neatly Stepped into the dock. These people are expressionless, with a chilling glow in their eyes, like a veteran warrior, but they don’t have the kind of ambiguity and publicity that are revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
