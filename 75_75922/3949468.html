			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa has maintained a day-to-day contact with His Royal Highness the Prince. <br /><br />############################################################################################################ <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel the attack on the palace of Wangdu as Roland Wimbledon’s punishment for Tefco Wimbledon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the militia team that attacked the West was defeated back to Wangdu, he did not hear the "warnings" carried by this group. Tassa thought it was only His Royal Highness. The bluff, or the slap in the face, screams at the time when Tiefko puts his attention on alert and defense, sending troops to attack other cities, as Garcia did, looting opponents before winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the follow-up orders from Bianbu Town made him feel wrong, and His Royal Highness seemed to be planning to attack Wangdu and asked him to prepare for the publicity. The latest order clearly tells that the attack will be launched on the first day of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which is exactly the same as the time notified in the "Warning". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at this sentence, "Improve the attack on the palace of the kingdom as punishment", that is, the Highness will directly attack the inner city of Wangdu - - But how is it possible? Wangdu has the strongest city wall of the Grey Fort, and the thickness can accommodate two houses side by side. Even the artillery under the temple is difficult to destroy. Together with the Knights of the Kings, the guards, and the militia recruited, it is difficult for the army without more than 10,000 people to break into the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting a raid with a witch is also a nightly talk. The stone of the gods in the palace is like a cow, and there are giant gods in the halls and palaces. The witch will be taken away from all abilities as soon as she steps into the room. This is also the reason why Tefco screamed and killed the witch, but no one retaliated. It would not be possible to spur a royal family in the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is a hidden danger in this method. If Feikeke. Wimbledon really died in the hands of the witch, the biggest benefit is the church... With a little guidance, the four princes will be able to take the throne and the devil's minions to take the throne, and the nobles will unite to resist his power. However, with the talent of His Royal Highness, Tassa believes that he will certainly see this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how can you break into the inner city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, what are you asking me for?" Pushing open the half-covered door, Hill Fox walked into the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for a new order," Taza said, "You sit down first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"...Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the strange expression of the former Acrobatic troupe, he can only smile helplessly, usually It was he who received the exact order to inform these people, but this time he was not convenient to inform the mission of His Highness in advance - if the palace of Wangdu was not attacked, this seemingly absurd instruction can easily reduce the trust of the other party. degree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the contrary, if His Highness really did this, it would be an unprecedented shock for them, and it would greatly enhance the confidence of this group of people - In particular, if you witnessed your Highness a thousand miles away, you will be able to pose a real threat to the throne of Tefko. This kind of propaganda effect is more effective than his consumption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Tassa chose a compromise, first calling Hill to the inner city, waiting for His Highness to fulfill his warning. If it succeeds, nature will be happy. If it fails, he only needs to lie that the messenger may be delayed on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink some tea," Tassa laughed. "Don’t hang your doubts on your face all the time. As an intelligence officer, the most important thing. Yes-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hide yourself, adults." He took the teacup. "Right, there have been a lot of patrols on the streets recently, even the walls. The guards on the garrison have also doubled. Is it that these moves are related to the orders of His Royal Highness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is true, Tiefko-"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa’s words were just halfway through, and a thunderstorm suddenly rolled over the mansion, and the sound of the sound made the window glass tremble. At the same time, the ground shook slightly, and the shock was short and clear. Hill couldn't keep up, the teacup in his hand fell straight to the ground and fell into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me," Tassa looked serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two rushed out of the garden house and immediately attracted the sight of a black smoke column in the direction of the palace. Obviously, the thunder was just from there. He saw the artillery and the musket under His Royal Highness. Naturally, only the alchemy powder can produce a raging sound. Moreover, such a violent tremor is not caused by the shelling. It is more like the original use of the evil spirit. The explosive package of the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill Zhang opened his mouth and could hardly believe his eyes. "Is it true that His Highness is in the warning?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Tassa finally let go of his heart. He turned and pretended to be deep. "This is also the new order that Your Highness wants to give you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco Tieqing Looking at the face, looking at the chandelier that fell in front of me, I couldn’t speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, Keke... Your Majesty, are you okay?" The former Prime Minister coughed in the dust that was flying all over the sky. "Hell, what happened outside?" ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco did not answer, only felt that the throat was doing a good job. Under the chandelier, a silver armor was pressed. At the time, he was reporting to himself about the recruitment of the refugees, but now he was cut off by the falling chandelier. If you take another step forward, I am afraid...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I think of it, he feels cold and straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this an earthquake?" The finance minister was shocked. "We have to leave the castle and go to the empty place."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s not safe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me shut up!" Tiefco shouted until the opening He only found his voice hoarse, like the one who was pinched out of his throat. "Sir Weis, take me to the basement immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty." Although the Steel Knights looked a little nervous, they were quite calm compared to the performance of several other ministers. He came over to help Tefco and walked downstairs. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, the new king saw the broken glass on the aisle, through the broken window, the temple on the side of the castle no longer exists. Among the soaring smoke, this magnificent building now has only a few solitary pillars left. This is not caused by an earthquake, but the effect of a large number of snow powder explosions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now leaving the castle is undoubtedly a dead end. God knows whether Roland Wimbledon has buried snow in other places, only the basement of thick stone walls is enough. Safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, Tiffco hated to think, why did the four brothers also have this alchemy weapon? It is difficult for Jiaxia to give him the formula when he left the clear water port, let him use snow powder to fight with his own defeat! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, how did he bury the snow powder in the palace? Even a superb witch can't do this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You bring the Knights and thoroughly search the entire palace area, especially the sewers, gardens and warehouses that are easy to hide snow powder!" Step into the basement Tiefco immediately ordered the steel knight to order, "I found suspicious people, whether they are noble or not, all arrested first, all the attendants and servants entering and leaving the palace, they must thoroughly search, one can not let go!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following, squatting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Sir Weimas left, the new king discovered that he had The back was wet with cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland actually did this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how he did it, this time he can hide the snow powder in the palace. Is it easy to put it in the castle next time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The location you are in is far less secure than you think. By then, everyone will see that your throne is already faltering."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
