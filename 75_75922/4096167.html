			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the situation has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the rehearsal, four people were brought out of the crowd by the new king’s guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobles can't help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, guess it’s right, they are four It’s the truth.” Roland said, “I’m willing to try it on the train. In the face of change, the courage to try is the most valuable.” Then he looked to the elected aristocrat, “Do it well, don’t miss it.” The opportunity to get there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yes... Your Majesty!" The four were flattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nonsense, George couldn’t help but sigh in his heart, courage? qualifications? Do not make jokes! These guys are just the barons on the edge of the fallen, the territories are poor, the output is meager, the business is not good, and the man is lacking. This is their true portrayal! The land that can't be used is naturally reluctant. The only reason to keep it is to be a fig leaf for identity. If you take a step back, you won't even receive the dinner invitation. Can you still receive the attention of the new king? Or to say... These people have already colluded with Roland Wimbledon to match the absurd scene of the show? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait... He suddenly thought of a rumor, a tales from the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few witnesses to this matter, but it is indeed related to the Four Princes. It is rumored that this person had conducted a trial in the Temple of the Twin Towers after the capture of the king. To rule the crimes of those great aristocrats. As a result of the post-production, the nobility of the king who controlled the real power was almost swept away, and Tiefco was also sentenced to the sentence of the first sentence, so it is better to say that it is to eliminate the dissident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the process is full of strange colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that Roland was guilty of a "question and answer game" for everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten questions, as long as there is a mistake, they will be sent to the prison - and the basis for arbitration is the legendary reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, George dismissed this statement and thought that it was only a rumor that the aristocrats who had escaped the punishment to cover up their guilty conscience and timidity, the so-called reading The heart is nothing but Roland's decision to let the other person decide. Even if the other party does not stay in the kingdom, it will not give the chance to return to the old ministers of Fei Keke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he finds himself somewhat uncertain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this rumor true? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next sentence is the third sentence, listen well," Istis’s voice rang again. "I don't want to give up my land and power at all. But in the face of overwhelming power, I don't want to take their lives for them." She compared the gesture to everyone, "Now it's your turn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the hall has gradually changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were people who had indifferent attitudes and reinterpreted their comments inadvertently, but when the first batch of nobles got the approval of the new king, they took the lead and left the crowd. There is a strange emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the answer is no longer neat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this round of guards still selected more nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sudden sinking of George Narri, and the Count of Delta is also included. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is going on?" Gay sneaked to him and whispered, "Did they be convinced by the new king?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George counted in secret, a total of twenty people were brought out, and even a few people stood in his mansion two days ago, discussing How to fight Roland. Together with the attendants and servants of these nobles, the crowd was instantly reduced by half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, impossible... If Roland has contact with so many people, I can't be unaware," he gnawed. "They should be temporary." Selected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What to say?" George glanced at the other side. "You have made a mistake. I see the land as more important than anything else. I will not hesitate to give up my life. If it is you, would you say it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s an idiot, he’s annoyed, the problem is not being picked The person who went out, but the remaining aristocracy - Roland Wimbledon can choose someone with his eyes closed, and then the last remaining one is classified as a suppressor, but how can he ensure that there will be no red water? The person on the side of the city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selecting the wrong object will only push this part of the force to the side of the opponent. This set of games is almost meaningless except for the horror of the snake, or that he just wants to be in the crowd. Show off your mind reading in front of you? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George looked around the hall and once again determined that the new king had only six guards, even though the latter narrowed the number to one or two and wanted to kill the chickens and monkeys. As long as the public is up, these six people may not be able to hold down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, he and the Three Rivers Count will not sit idly by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Submission of power is not an embarrassing answer," Roland smiled at the second group of nobles. "From ancient times to the present, the strength of power has always been the decision of the human class." According to the basis of sorting, the importance of judging the situation is not much less than courage. Your ancestors can occupy a foot in the gray castle and pass on their own blood, instead of annihilating in the long river of history, which is itself a kind of strength. Proof, I am very glad that you can inherit this. In addition, I also promise that you will not be treated differently from the first group of nobles, as long as you remember today’s answer in your mind, if you encounter similar problems in the future. Think about the power I have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he looked to the North Pearl, "Read the next sentence."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis nodded. "The fourth sentence, I don't want to give up on both sides, I don't know how to choose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This statement is short, but only five or six people are left in the remaining nobility. Mouth, most chose to remain silent, they have realized that they were being open to differentiate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the people who retelled, the guards only picked out three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, squat, we believe that you can see through the hearts of people, so stop here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, this is a welcome banquet after all, you see..." Earl of Delta and Earl of Three Rivers have discouraged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The neutrals are less than I thought," Roland did not hear. "Swinging and hesitating is not a good quality." Especially in the ever-changing wave of change. But you belong to the category that can be transformed. Let's stay here first. Maybe after a quarter of an hour, you will change your opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused and faced the remaining nobles. "The next sentence is the last sentence, but I think you should have guessed its content, or the thoughts in your heart. In this case, this sentence I personally said it well-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In any case, I am not willing to hand over the land and power. For this reason, I will not hesitate to take risks - as long as When the king is defeated, the family and wealth will last forever!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, the bonfire seemed to have no wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no opening in the hall, the air is solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if you don't answer. I said before, this is not a suggestion, but an order." Roland slowly said, "No repeaters, no more peers." Qualification, your way will stop here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean," George also sank, "no evidence, no trial In one sentence, do you want to condemn us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still twenty-seven of the remaining nobles, which is far more than his It is expected that, according to the title, each person will take two to four followers, adding up to at least 60 people, and there are still many reserve knights. What are the benefits of pushing them to this new king? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not afraid of getting burned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
