			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book knocked on the door, and there was a quick response from the door. "Please come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She pushed the door inside, Anna was sitting at the table by the window and flipping through the thick books. The sun shone from the window and pulled the woman's figure. Her soft cheeks and neck were white and glaring, and the long, linen-covered hair covering her shoulders was almost dyed in pale gold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week of getting along, the book has basically figured out the temperament of the other party, such as having a blunt voice, never turning around, calm and quiet, especially eager to learn... In short, It is difficult for a child born in a civilian home to be like Anna, and the mind is pure and peaceful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't play that...card game?" The book took a stool and sat next to Anna. In the last two days, the sisters will quickly return to the castle as soon as they practice, squeezing in the room of Soroya to play the so-called Quent card, and competing for each other to collect the pieces of paper, it seems to be happy. Even Nana Wa. Pine, who came to Anna every day, rarely reduced the number of appearances after learning the method of battle. Unlike a few days ago, she always saw the little girl with magical healing ability in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to read more books," Anna turned to the next page. "I don't have the ability to do that. I only have to spend more time on it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reads almost everything, from historical biographies to long poems, including various folktales that I have heard from the streets and lanes, as long as they are compiled into books. She can see it with gusto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book touched her head lovingly. "No need to worry, I will tell you a book."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the child who changed the fate of the survivors of the Communist Youth League. Without her, the nightingale would not go to Bianbu Town halfway, nor would she know the four princes of the Grey Fort, and would not have everything that happened next. In a sense, she is the savior of all witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason why I was very fond of Anna at the beginning, and the latter quickly accepted myself after seeing the book of magic and expressed great envy. Love, this makes the book feel a little ridiculous. In the co-sponsorship, no sister has ever envied her own abilities. In contrast, Anna, her magic capacity is the largest of the witches seen in the nightingale, and the green flame that is freely sent and received is also very aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your hair is a bit long," the book smashed the bangs that Anna was about to cover her eyes. "No one has helped you cut your hair?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head. "It’s all my own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book suddenly came to the fore," It’s not good to wring out the hair. Let me help you trim it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do you still do this?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I was assisting, most of my sister's hair was cut by me," the book smirked. "Wait a minute, I will take the tool."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly walked back with a cloth bag. Spread a layer of white cloth wrapped in a layer of bronze scissors. The scissors are V-shaped, and the grips at both ends are covered with fine scratches, which give off the luster of the infiltration, which is obviously used frequently. Before the book was added to the co-help club, it was this pair of scissors that made a haircut for a man in the pub in Haifeng County. In addition to buying bread, the rest of the bronze eagle was handed over to a broken captain, and the captain taught her to read and read until she passed away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book is skillfully unfolding white cloth, tied around Anna’s neck, and began to help her trim the long hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...some questions I want to ask you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The scissors are constantly separated in her palms, giving a crisp squeak. A cluster of flax-colored hair slipped over the fingertips and landed on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The book you showed me yesterday, the many stories recorded above, almost all have the same ending. Will the prince be a princess as a wife?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hand was a little paused, and the storybook was not a real book, but she was listening to sailors in Haifeng County for more than a decade. A collection of folktales that are sung. Only the book has specifically screened the content. There is no story of a happy ending. The prince is not with the princess. He finally made up a book and turned it out to Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
