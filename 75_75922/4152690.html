			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right, four o'clock direction...two!" The warnings of teammates and the sound of machine guns mixed together, seemingly intermittent, "attention - cast ! spear "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Goode suddenly putt to the left, the biplane suddenly flipped half, tilted downward fall to - <br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咻-!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone spear swept through the head with a howling, one of which directly penetrated the wing There was a big hole in the skin on the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t look at the enemy and continued to accelerate down, making the aircraft reach its speed very quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the method of warfare summed up by His Royal Highness, since the Air Knight and the enemy have played against each other. The beasts have the flexibility that the biplanes can't reach at low speeds. They can hover in the air or perform the turning and inverting movements in a very small radius. This makes the simulations use tactical actions to get rid of the bite. The tail set is hard to work with, and the rear seat shooter can hardly predict the target's route within the effective range. The combination of the two is extremely unfavorable for the fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the same, the beast has a very obvious weakness, that is, its only attack is from the spearman behind the rider, and flying and climbing The speed is not as good as the skyfire. The throwing magic stone with a maximum of two consecutive forces is sufficient threat only in close range, both in terms of distance and power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when being targeted by the enemy, the safest way to play is to use the belly to face the enemy while pulling the distance between them as soon as possible, and then Climb up again and use the effective range of the machine gun to kill the opponent. The biplane has a protective plate in both cockpit positions, which can effectively protect the driver from being directly penetrated by the spear. The wide wing seems to be a very fragile target, but as long as it does not hit the main skeleton, poke a few on it. The hole will not have a fatal effect on the aircraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If today’s fire is a major improvement over the training machine, the airfoil roll operation is also incorporated into the main joystick. The driver only needs one. With one hand, you can easily control the pitch and direction of the aircraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the full speed is reached, it takes only a few tens of seconds to open the enemy. During this period, the madman throws two bone spears at the top, and hits the fast-moving plane. It is no easy task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and many actual combats have proved that the method is effective. So far, the empty knight has lost several planes, but no one has been killed on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the roar of the engine screaming, Goode flew out for hundreds of meters in an instant, even if the madman behind him wanted to throw a spear at this time, there was no chance. I got to his side. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; but after he pulled the nose did not turn around to look for the first time these two eyeing his demons, but set his sights on another plane The bitten tail friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the enemies behind, Heinz is waiting for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the height and vision advantages of the accumulation to attack the enemies who are chasing after the teammates, while giving their tails to the teammates to protect, that is, empty The Cavaliers' second major doctrine! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two times behind, Goode got his fourth victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers began to take advantage of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning and McMug also joined the battlefield at this time--all the devils were horrified to discover that when the air didn’t know when there was one more In the same way, it looks very powerful, and the target of the attack is themselves. Under the huge mouth of the bloody basin, the fearful beasts showed obvious fear. Even if the madman was angry and pulled the reins, their actions were not as good as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This confusion further exacerbates the devil's disadvantages. Lightning is like a ghost in the battlefield. Short-distance sonic flying makes the madman unable to parry, often waiting for them. At the time of lifting the bone spear, the lightning guns were already on their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every few minutes, a beast was shot down, and there was a "devil rain" in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These movements of these giants falling on the ground naturally fall into the eyes of Farina. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
