			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said this stuff is the kind of weapon that can break the ground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A brief introduction to the Ice Witch, Elena’s eyes widened and her anger rushed. “Don’t they think about it, what if this thing is blown up in Fran’s belly?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worm body next to it can not help but shake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After touching it, it is a prototype in the laboratory," Ai Gesha found a pack of copper tubes from the iron box and spread it out. In front of the other party, "Do not insert these things into the explosive container, they will not respond to the general impact and burning."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other gods I immediately came to the interest. They heard about the artillery drills from Felice, that is, on the 76th. After moving to the west of the gray fort, they also witnessed the first army to resist the invasion of evil spirits. Fighting is no stranger to gunpowder weapons, and this is the first time they have been so close to such weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if it's really baked on the fire? It's so loud when it explodes, it should be very violent at ordinary times."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It looks no different from bricks..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you use this? Insert the copper tube Will it explode immediately?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who would dare to use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha She also felt a headache. She only knew a general principle about the firearms that slammed the drums. It was not much better to say how the operation was better than the Thames compatriots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The red mark is the fire detonator, it must be ignited to take effect," at this moment, the lightning suddenly came over, as the family said, "blue The drawing is to pull the detonator, just pull out the string wrapped around it to trigger the explosive. There is also a yellow mark that can be detonated with current, but it doesn't seem to be in the bag."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha was surprised, "How did you know this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I am an explorer!" The girl touched her nose. "When the First Army trained and tested new weapons, I basically went to the scene to watch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we should put these The stuff was buried in the hole, and an escape route was blown up. Or was he plucking Fulan back and throwing explosives backwards?" Elena said, "If it can replace us to stop the enemy's pursuit, the ten gods should be witches. I can beat the Fran."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s no good to leave me here. ——”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t say it!” Alena interrupted. “We are not afraid to sacrifice, but we will not give up our partners at will, don’t forget. "The teachings of Eleanor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every witch is equally important." The rest of the people nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But...the two methods may not work," said the lightning whisper. "If you put it in the hole, even a small space ignites a pack of explosives." It is enough to tear us into pieces; it can be replaced with an empty hole, its power will be much smaller." The little girl glanced at the iron shovel and shovel on the ground. "This is probably the first army used to blow holes or block The tools of the channel are not really weapons. It is estimated that the flames and airflow alone can kill the evil beasts within ten steps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is inevitable to silence. If you deal with ordinary beasts, you can scare them away by the sound of the explosion. But the evil beasts are obviously summoned by the dome monsters. If they don’t kill them, they are afraid. It is not easy to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There may be another way," the nightingale suddenly said, "That is to kill the enemy's leader."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean...the monster hanging from the top of the hole?" Elena frowned. "We can't fly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s too dangerous to fly!” 趁Lightning has not yet received the call, and Ai Gesha has already said first, “This is not a defensive battle of the city wall. There is support at all times behind it. It’s not unusual to see flying species in a mixed species of evil spirits. If you carry heavy loads, the speed and altitude will be seriously degraded. Once it is besieged by the enemy, she is likely to have no chance to rush into the monster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
