			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough cough...cough..." The dust tumbling, and Cuda coughed slowly from the ground. At the moment, there is still debris falling from the top of the head. The building that is still tall is now only half the bottom. Fortunately, the collapsed beams and columns form a narrow place to live, and he survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is anyone still alive?" he shouted laboriously, but the raging dust quickly blocked his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously teammates are unlikely to hear his voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tingda had to cross the gap between the beam and the stone and climbed over the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the light, he could see several broken pieces of wood on his arms and thighs, and the leached blood stained the military uniform. The retarder has undoubtedly played a key role again. If he does not block the pain, he does not know how long it will take to recover from the fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to get rid of the ruins, and Sudda suddenly found that several devils were less than ten meters away from him – the other was clearly the same as the clock tower The troops coming, if the spiders’ blows come later, it’s just a matter of time, but now the situation is reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the enemies’ enveloping is self-evident, and it is intended to eliminate the possibility of escape from this robbery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;裘达 did not hesitate too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the possibility of leaving him alive is negligible. The rifle can only shoot one bullet at a time, and the madman’s hand is enough for him. Tear him into pieces during the bolting time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, he still decisively raised the musket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sand people, death is not terrible, it is terrible not to see hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His death can be exchanged for the continuation of the clan, to allow the wife and children to eat, this is enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment of shooting, I couldn’t help but think of the moment when I was carrying the heavy pressure of the Iron Casserole’s clan and resolutely invested in the Grand Chief – that night, He also took the determination to die, and launched an assault on the anger and the bone-cutting clan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A madman crashed into the ground with a gunshot, while the other three quickly rushed toward him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this distance, the claws are more effective than the spears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, an open big hand has reached in front of him - if you grasp it, I am afraid that half of the face will be crushed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Minda suddenly felt that his body was not under the control of his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned back and escaped this deadly attack with an incredible bend angle, then used the handle as a fulcrum and slammed backwards A leap, with the help of the upswing, completed a beautiful back roll. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When landing, the second bullet has been pushed into the gun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tingda is completely stunned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a side effect of a retarder? But he not only did not feel the pain after the superposition, but the action was more flexible - except that it was not from his will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he is worried, his body does not show any signs of stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil screamed and rushed over, the hands of the sandman holding the gun were lifted steadily, and the muzzle of the gun was almost already on the other side. On the brain! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“嘭——”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy’s head bursts open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Trent thought that everything would be over, the body made another unexpected move. He stepped forward and slammed into the arms of the madman, pulling out the bayonet at his waist with his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This knife is from the bottom to the top, piercing the enemy's helmet from the chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red fog suddenly sprang up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the enemy’s hands clasped and wanted to bring him with him, Trent had already left the other’s cuddle as muddy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madman slanted out of two steps and eventually fell to the ground softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil who defeated the human strength in close combat and was far from human beings was never thought of for Tatsu, but now he has not only done this. Also killed two in one breath? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last remaining madman finally raised his bone spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the target that it is aiming at is not the Trent, but a broken wall in the ruins of the bell tower! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear penetrated the wooden window on the wall like a light, and a short figure exclaimed and fell out from the broken wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the law! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madman completely ignored the shrinking arm and strode toward him, and Trent involuntarily turned his direction and rushed to the enemy. The two rushed to the front of the law at almost the same time. At the moment when the madman shot, his saber also pierced the other's throat from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red mist spattered from the wound and sprinkled on the arm raised by Fa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The partner made a scream of screaming, and Trent was shocked to return to his own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you be--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the opponent's fast festering arm, he suddenly understood <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why... are you here? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the churches in the North, the Mojins did not regard the witch as a symbol of evil, but as a goddess with extraordinary power. Because of the scarcity, A clan who can have a goddess is also a potential substitute for the Iron Sands City.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;裘 has heard that a tribe named the sandstone clan is in its goddess Under the leadership of the Bishui Queen, the expedition to the far north, the last rumor that he will never return. And the goddess is called Kabbah, whose ability can instruct others to work for themselves.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they did not get the rewards they deserved. The departure of a large number of young adults made the sandstones slump, and the women and children who stayed in the extreme south were annexed by other clans until the great chief re-established the law of the desert and After the rules, this clan name was preserved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superior combat skills, uncontrolled body, and the background of Mo Jin......... After the incredible scene, except for the sand Outside of the goddess, he couldn’t find any other reasonable explanations.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now obviously not a time to think about it. He took a bandage from his pocket and made it into law.菈 菈 胳膊 , , , , , , , 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈 菈Speak this up..." There was a soft whisper from the teammates behind him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please. The other party broke weakly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hesitating for a while, he nodded slightly. "Well, I don't say it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunfire around is still coming, but the frequency has slowed down a lot.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw that the spider devil who had broken into the city had been bombarded by the field and had been completely paralyzed.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
