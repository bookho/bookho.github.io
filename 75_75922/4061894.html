			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Witch Alliance welcomes you to join."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty will have already prepared the contract At the table, he smiled and said to the wolf-hearted witches, "After reading the vows on the back of the contract and signing the name, you can formally become a member of the alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This process should have been completed as early as possible - if not for what hunting contest is proposed by His Royal Highness. No matter who loses and wins, she has been worried about the days of the game. The day of the hunting is more than a year, and she blames her for a while. Together with the artillery exercises that followed, the result was postponed. But what surprised her a little was that Anne, who seemed to be calm, would take the initiative to find the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When Wendy, don't you test our abilities first?" Amy asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week and a half without winter city, this lively little girl won the love of most sisters, and her innocent and trustworthy personality made her quickly and everyone Getting familiar with it, it’s quite easy to call Wendy’s sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The test is usually arranged after signing the contract," Wendy said softly. "If you have any questions about the terms of the contract, you can ask now." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only person who can read the text is Amy, three companions By her side, listening to the terms while exchanging views. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty looked at the witches who whispered in a hurry, and couldn’t help but recall the scene when they signed the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first she felt that the above rules were too "unbelievable", and it was probably just that the lord deliberately showed mercy, and it would take a long time to change it, or A set of dark rules is imposed on the back to restrain the witch's actions. However, she later found out that she was wrongly wrong. Until two years later, the basic framework of the contract has not changed. At this point, Wendy felt that the choice at the time was the most correct decision in his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, we can get a Golden Dragon every month!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" What can I buy if I want to buy something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The part of paid leave...can't it be true?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the majesty cannot provide security and food security, the witch has the right to suspend the contract... Is this really not betrayal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Wendy smiled and answered their questions, just like answering the original self. She can almost guess at what moment Anne and others will be amazed, because she was so surprised to read the complete contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Majesty gave the witch the most desired thing, freedom and recognition. The Witch Alliance has been closely linked to the fate of Roland Wimbledon, and Wendy believes that even if he is in crisis and can no longer provide security and food and shelter, they will not leave him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This connection is not written on the contract, but is stronger than words and language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is foreseeable that there will be fewer and fewer scenes of fun and memories, and the newly awakened witches have a very different living environment with them. ——No need to be threatened by the church, nor face the hostility of the people around you, or even relatives. Naturally, they will not be grateful for the hard-won new life like them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the finalization of the terms, the oath and signature are read. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no mandatory provision, just that there is no hostility towards Roland and the Witch Alliance, and they join the Alliance on a voluntary basis. After the four people finished reading, Wendy received the fingerprint of the nightingale to confirm the authenticity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, we are sisters." She smiled and hugged four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the Witch Alliance has four more members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
