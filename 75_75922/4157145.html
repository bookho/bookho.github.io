			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a very grand scene in the morning glow city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the watchful eyes of thousands of people, the church parade held a series of flags and slowly passed through the gates. Walking in the forefront for them is the Knights of the Royal Family. This has been a serious treatment that has not been reproduced for a long time, and everyone’s eyes are placed on the woman in the middle of the team wearing a Chinese costume and a crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is the new pope in the rumor, and the key figure in defeating the insurgents and leading Hermes back on track. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the church’s aggression against the wolf heart and the winter has once tarnished its image, it is undeniable that they still have some influence, and recently this parade often Walking through the front line of the battlefield, the relief of the evacuees while encouraging the world to fight the demon, won a lot of gratitude and gratitude. The news was also transmitted back to the city through the various channels, which made the people curious about the new pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the pope was a high-ranking presence, even if the king wanted to see them, they had to get permission in advance, they were willing to go to the danger, and even cared for every civilian. The pope is rare. And whenever the woman smiled at everyone, it always caused a burst of excitement - in addition to the identity of the other party, the extremely outstanding appearance is also one of the factors that caused a sensation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team eventually stopped in front of the inner castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope rolled over and stepped onto the ladder, and stood at the door to greet her, it was the king of the Grey Fort, Roland Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two reached out and simply clung together - although most people saw this novelty for the first time, they could See the meaning of equality. This also disguised the rumor's rhetoric, the new pope's superior position was supported by the Grey Fort, and the relationship between the two sides has been reshaped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the warm applause of the crowd, the two walked side by side into the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I am rude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman leaned over after the door closed. When he was preparing to kneel on one knee, he was pulled up by Roland. "No, I think it's quite good. Not to mention that you are not a pure lord of the past. The Witch Alliance does not need such a cumbersome etiquette. Have you stayed in the Holy City for too long and forgot this?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is transferred to Hermes, taking over the Holy City as the Pope’s agent, responsible for the placement of nuns and orphans, and Isabe to prevent the madness of the pill. Pull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course...no." Isabella suddenly stopped after she said it, and she looked up in surprise. "Your Majesty, you just said..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't get it wrong, Wendy had proposed to accept you as a member of the league, and I agreed with her proposal." Roland nodded, "though The penalty is five years, but if you do a good job in Hermes, it is a reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella stayed for a while Reacted, "But your Majesty, I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After joining the Witch Alliance, there is a fixed chaotic beverage release every month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃-" The latter's "but" suddenly stuck in the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know what you want to say, really..." Roland sighed. "You pure people always like to stick in the inexplicable place, or say Torture yourself. Besides, redemption does not require shackles and chains to achieve. If you want to prepare these things for you all the time, I will feel a headache. So at this time, thank you to Wendy like everyone else." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Isabella bit her lip and slowly lowered her head. "I understand."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that you have been living in responsibility and command in the past, but it doesn't matter, one day you will get used to this new way of life." Roland changed the subject, "This meeting It’s a rare promotional opportunity, it should have been more grand, but I don’t want to waste time on the ceremony and banquet. You should know that no winter city has been attacked by evil beasts.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, after all, in the past 100 years, Hermes was the main force against the evil beast. I think the church must have accumulated a lot of relevant information."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Isabella did not hesitate to say, "I will tell you everything I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When four days ago I learned that there was no winter. When the city was suddenly attacked by evil beasts, Roland didn't care too much at first—he had experienced many evil moons in the West, and several years ago people had been able to deal with them with wooden guns and firearms, not to mention the current army. Although there are a lot of evil beasts in the seasons other than the evil moon, the first army is fighting the devil in many areas, and he has no time to consider the reasons behind this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect the development of things to be beyond his expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night he received several telegrams from the North Hill Tower, and the situation became a sharp turn. A large number of evil beasts crossed the Takira line and launched an attack on the pioneering land. The garrison troops also resisted, but failed to stop the enemy's offensive. If the armored train was not put into support in time, the loss would be even more alarming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the report mentions that there are several witnesses who claim to see ghost-like monsters that move quickly, quietly and almost undetectable to the naked eye, only The body shape will appear after the blood is stuck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Roland realize that he might seriously underestimate the ability of the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Isabella finished, Roland found that his guess was confirmed - Compared to the holy city of Hermes, the evil moon in the west of the gray fort is just a tributary in the sea. The type of evil beast is much more than that of the devil. Some mixed species are even hard to find prototypes in the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, with a very long body, a wild animal that can cross the surface, climb the wall, and a horned bird, a great threat to ordinary people. Birds, etc., are monsters that have never been seen in the West. At the same time, he also had a basic clue about the reason for the attack. The large group of evil beasts suddenly appeared in the back of the pioneering land, and in all likelihood, it was the wild animal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This still does not explain why the winter situation will become so severe. Even if there is no huge wall like the Holy City in the rear, the First Army is also a newcomer with no experience, but the gap in the weapons is enough to make up for it. Perhaps people will fall into chaos at the beginning, but after the emergency plan is launched, the military should be able to stabilize the situation quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, he noticed that Isabella never mentioned the kind of ghost-like monster, which also caused him to wonder - that is new The enemy, or the false report of the people in the chaos? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a waiter walked into the room with a paper bag. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty, no winter city sent a new letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a telegram? Roland was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, this was shipped by the empty knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take it apart "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stack of pictures in the paper bag, and Roland spreads it on the table, only to find out that it is all true of the attacker. Portrayal. Obviously, these pictures are all from the hands of Soroya - the latter is undoubtedly more accurate on the intelligence level than the text report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that even if they have no fighting ability, they are doing their best to protect their homes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, one of the pictures of the monster's body caught Roland's attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be killed by the train, most of the body sticks to the iron plate, its shape can not be compared with any kind of evil described by Isabella The beast is connected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This hybrid, have you seen it in Hermes?" He pulled the drawing out and placed it in front of Isabella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked through it carefully and then shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
