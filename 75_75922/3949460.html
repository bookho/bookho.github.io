			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷,嗷!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McGen plays with wings in the newly renovated castle backyard and Tail, turn around for everyone to enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have already learned about the things from the witches, when Roland first saw the "evil beast", I still feel it. Shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brown-skinned bird has a tail length of ten meters and a wingspan of nearly fifteen meters, similar to the bat's flesh, clear to the sun. See the blood vessels and skeleton under the thin skin. Probably the body is too long, the giant bird has four limbs, the thickness is similar to the adult arm, and the claws at the end are used to support the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most compelling opponent's head - three eyes are triangularly distributed on the top and sides of the head, except that the entire face is full of blood Instead of the common cockroaches of birds. When Mai Mai spoke, his mouth would be one by one, revealing a sharp circle of teeth and a long tongue, and the other witches would make a burst of exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the devil's mount?" the leaves exclaimed. "Fortunately, we are not in such a wild land, or we can't run alone." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it wasn't for her evolution of new abilities, I wouldn't be able to come back at the time," said the nightingale, touching the smooth neck of McMug, "I A bag of char-grilled fish fillets will be prepared for you every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷-!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "I know, I need to pour more honey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tail of the giant bird is more cheerful. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These fish are obviously mys, Roland sighed and took the kitchen food to reward others, don’t be so grandiose! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then follow the old rules and test your new abilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good嗷!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a morning of toss, Roland got the McMug version The detailed ability of the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the previous zooming convention, the brown-skinned giant bird she changed was a little bigger than the original version of the devil riding, and the load-bearing ability was also improved a little. It is possible to carry two witches to take off at the same time. However, at full load, the flight speed can only be maintained at around 80 kilometers per hour, which is much slower than lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the advantage of McMug is that it is long enough, lightning will not only reduce the altitude when carrying heavy objects, but also the magic consumption will increase, and the giant bird will only change. Whether flying high or low, back one or back two, the magic cost is extremely slow, the only need to consider their own physical problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical power contained in the wheat scorpion has also grown dramatically, from the countdown position of the Witch Alliance to a medium level, enough to change seven or eight times a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Roland also confirmed his previous speculation through Mai Mai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evolution of a witch depends on an understanding of one's own abilities, whether it is through learning or sudden epiphany, which may lead to a change in ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also means that witches have the potential for natural evolution - as long as the time is long enough, there will always be one or two lucky winners out there. The post-evolutionary ability and the initial ability are completely heaven and earth, and even have the effect of turning rotten into magic. Is this the reason why the church is trying to suppress the wild witch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch, the Lord’s Castle District ushered in a major event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly four months of construction and renovation, the Witch Building was finally put into use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at this residential building with only three floors, including less than 50 suites, and sighed at the top of the house in the later generations. Building level, but here, it is the representative of the highest level of architecture in the mainland kingdom - not scale, but technical. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
