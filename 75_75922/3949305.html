			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Tassa restores consciousness, there is a sting in the back of the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, this woman is really sincere. He opened his eyes and tried to move, finding that his hands were firmly tied behind him, and his feet were tied to the legs of the two chairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He woke up," the voice of the woman came from the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your name?" One person walked up to him and provoked his chin. "I suggest you not lie, or you will become a moat tomorrow. With a floating body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa blinked, and the woman wore a veil on her head, and her body was covered in a robe, apparently not wanting to be seen by herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tasa." He replied truthfully, while quietly looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a narrow house surrounded by dusty plaster statues, finished, and obviously only half carved. The accumulated dust stained the plaster into taupe, as if it had been abandoned for a long time. There was no window in the room, I couldn't see the sky, and I couldn't guess the time. The only light source came from an oil lamp on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the Longling Ridge to the Silver City, so tireless," the woman whispered. "Are you looking for us?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not that I am looking for you, but I am looking for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the total aid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A witch organization like you, I was commissioned by them to spread the news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "A nonsense," she snapped. "I don't know where you heard the name, but the co-help club is far away from the sea breeze in the east. Do you think that if you just use a name, will we believe it?" A dagger was taken from the waist - Tassa found that it was his own use. "I will give you a last chance, don't challenge my patience!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "All I said is true!" he said with a repressed voice that shouted and dared not shout. "They originally planned to go to the desolate mountains to find the holy mountain, such as Not only did I find the holy mountain settled in Bianbu Town, but the demon phagocytic symptoms also disappeared, so they wanted to save more witches. I swear I didn't lie!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Why did they find you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I helped them, a member of the Aided Society was chased by the church trial army, I Helped her to lead the chase. Their mentor is called Hakala, and Wendy and the book, they asked me to come!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;masked woman listening After a moment of silence, insert the dagger into the waist and walk behind him. Soon, Tassa heard the buzz of two people coming from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chick, he commented in his heart, the two men are quite accurate, but the trial is completely outspoken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most taboo of the trial is to give only one choice. If you don’t answer the question, it’s easy to push the interrogator to the road – kill or not? If you kill it, you lose the possibility of obtaining information. If you don't kill it, it is equivalent to failing to realize the threat that you personally say. This will seriously damage the majesty of the interrogator, and the effectiveness of the next threat will also drop significantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you change him to interrogate, you will definitely start with a finger--every time you lie, cut a finger, even if there is a judgment error, Not a big problem. Threats that are necessary to make the enemy collapse quickly, and it is difficult for people without professional training to pass such an interrogation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a frightened look and dump it, let the other person be suspicious, and expose the fact that they simply can't tell if they are lying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information of Hakala, Mount Athos and the Communist Youth League is true and reliable, which will further strengthen the persuasiveness of your own intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the masked woman appeared in front of him again, "When did they arrive in the West?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many people do they..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forty? I don't know too much, except for Hakala, other witches rarely appear. "Tasa decided to add a little more chips. "The snake magic Hakala, have you heard of it? Her ability is to summon the magic snake, there is a kind of "nothingness", which can quickly remove any toxins, I have seen it with my own eyes. magical. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not afraid of witches? "The woman's tone seems a bit confusing.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why are you afraid, the witches of the co-help club are very beautiful...not the evil beasts of the claws, they are not hurting." I am an ordinary person. If I am afraid, I will not go so far to help them spread the news. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If someone goes to Bianbu Town, how can I contact them?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some of them can perceive the magic, and when the witch arrives there will naturally be found by them." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shadow, what do you think? "The masked woman looked up at him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," the witch, known as the shadow, hesitated. "If you don't wait for your sister to come back, do it." Decide, she must know what to do. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...also. She nodded, looking for a clean chair, sitting in front of Tasman.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is the sister?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leader," the attitude of the masked woman has softened a lot compared to before, probably because the sentence is not afraid of the witch to make her feel a lot, "She Will take us out of here. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave, where to go?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party shook his head and did not answer.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not the witch of Silver City? Tassa continued to ask, "Your accent is not like Wang Duren. Yinguangcheng is very close to the king, so the residents here are proud of the imitation of Wangdu accent. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said for a moment, "I...from the South." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women from all over the Kingdom gathered here, and soon they will be taken away by the guides... Tassa is thinking, no doubt, this again It’s a witch organization, they are recruiting companions, just like they did before the co-sponsorship. But where are they going to go?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the house The footsteps sounded outside.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister is back! "The shadow cheered, and as the wooden door slammed open, Tassa's heart also held his breath.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the one who has been using the underground channel Who is the message? The voice of the newcomer is mature and steady. "What have you asked?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What he said seems to be true. The masked woman said both the content of the inquiry and her own opinion. "If it was not for deep contact with the co-help, he could not know so clearly." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, that's right," she passed by Tassa and stood in front of him. Unlike the masked woman, she had no cover on her face. Long black hair is almost the same as the waist. The appearance seems to be around twenty-six and sixteen years old. The most interesting thing is her eyes. Tassa discovers that her pupil outer ring is golden, even if she is standing in the backlight. She can clearly see her eyes like stars.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taza thinks that she has seen many witches around her Highness, but the appearance of this woman is still counted. On the top of the class, her left eye has a scar that runs through the brow bone and extends down to the cheek. This scar not only does not destroy her beauty, but adds a chill to her. When she saw her first sight, Tassa felt that the woman was a full-fledged warrior.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the co-help club really found the holy mountain It should not send people to spread such news. She shook her head. "This will only make the church feel like the wind. If they don't leave the border town early, I am afraid that it will be a big disaster." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
