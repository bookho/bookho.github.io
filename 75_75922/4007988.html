			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Roland saw Iphi in the office again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her temperament is better than before, and her eyes seem to have more complex emotions, which are more lively than before, and more like a " People". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hetty Morgan wants to see you, but she is not convenient to come over, so she will ask Tilly Wimbleton to marry us," she said. The opening remarks after the ceremony made Roland a little surprised. "Herti does not like His Royal Highness. She thinks that the fighting witch is the core of the sleeping island. The bloody teeth should not be treated as ordinary witches. So she hopes from You open the situation here, and promise that Tilly can give, she can give more. Of course... I know you don't need these."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell me in detail about the bloody meeting," Roland held on his chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story is half an hour, and his brow The wrinkle and deeper, the last time, he couldn't help but ask, "Do these things, does Tilli know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Iphio shakes Shaking his head, "Herti is forbidden to disclose the past of the bloody meeting. She rarely talks with her Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other witch organizations joining the Sleeping Island? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They and the Grey Fortress are getting closer, especially after the establishment of the Sleeping Curse. Although some fighting witches secretly agree with Hert’s remarks. However, most of them are unwilling to confront the ashes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure on the shoulders of Tilly is not much smaller than himself. Roland is secretly feeling in his heart, and he is The rulers of the West are justified. The witches on the island are more like a loose covenant. Although Tilly is the caller, but for those who go for it. The small group did not abide by regulations of the authority. This is also the case, in order to see her ability to excel – unite most of the auxiliary witches, and actively establish contacts with the secular rulers of other islands, especially the establishment of the “sleeping curse”, which gives her a management The opportunity for all witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, "the auxiliary witch is equally important" can not be just an empty talk, the witch bounty guild will give an excellent show stage for those eccentric witches. When they complete a mission to get a large amount of rewards, and these rewards are used to improve the quality of life on the island, this mindset will gradually form - after all, a powerful fighting witch, do not want to chew the salted fish all day. And the status of the auxiliary witch is improved, and the heart will naturally be more toward Tilly. At that time, as the master of the guild, Tilly will undoubtedly gain a great voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably this is why Heidi Morgan can't wait to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the bloody teeth itself is equally suspicious. How can Heti, the daughter of Morgan Grand Duke, not be able to afford a group of non-combat witches? It can only be said that she did not intend to take in those "useless" people from the beginning. Unlike the purpose of warming up the group, she just wanted a team that could fight for herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her obsession with the kingdom of the wolf heart, Roland is more vigilant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be necessary to write a confidential letter to Tilly, when she is careful to watch the movements of the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Herty is not forbidden to talk about the inside of the bleeding?" He tapped the table and asked, "You are not going to take orders from her again?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iphie bit his lip, "I want to join the Witch Alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patter Suddenly stopped, Roland looked at her in surprise, although she knew that the military display of the hot weapons would be a serious blow to these powerful witches who were proud of their power, but did not expect the effect to be so... significant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you hurt McMug," he thought for a moment, "I can't temporarily -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "On this point, please punish me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iphie unbuttoned the robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
