			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland returned to the castle when it was late, and the snow outside was big. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went into the bedroom, took off his coat, shook the snow at the neckline, and hung it on the hanger by the fireplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, don't you think this is too urgent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night Shows the figure in front of the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nanawa?" Roland poured himself a glass of wine with himself, even though the ale was much bitterer than the beer of the later generations, but he gradually Used to this taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale took the cup and held it in his hand but didn't drink it - she was waiting for the prince's answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no more suitable period than now," Roland will drink the wine and fill it with himself again. "I want to play in the demon month." With Nana's ability, it is impossible to conceal the identity of the witch. It is impossible to instantly heal a fatal injury. It is not something that ordinary herbal medicine or bloodletting therapy can do. This can be imagined by everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take this blessing to the small town outside the border of the West, the church has a limited impact on it - I will not be willing to put Jinlong Squandering in this place that can be abandoned at any time," Roland continued. "There is no church in the town. The missionaries returned to the long song fortress with the nobles. What do you think of Bianbu Town? The outside world has severed the island of contact."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is what you have planned for a long time?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded. "The heavy snow will bury the road leading to the Long Song Fortress, and the shipping of the dock is in my hands. We have at least three months, To reverse the idea that "the witch is an evil person." If it is just propaganda, the effect is extremely limited, and it is necessary to follow the distance contact to quickly eliminate this misunderstanding. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why he wants to leave Nanawa anyway. He wants to create a far-off version of Nightingale.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legendary nurse has been trying to look after the wounded, so that the casualty rate has dropped from 42% to 2%, so that the soldiers will be the goddess of the lantern, and the entire nurse will be brought together. The prestige of the profession has been raised to worship.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanava’s ability is even more magical, healing the wound through magic, as long as it’s not on the spot, you can get back Life. This is probably more effective than any weapon for the morale of the militia.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, thanks to her father’s name, the aristocrats, often with hunters and farmers on weekdays. Dealing with the attitude of treating civilians is very peaceful, and even allowing Nana to go to the college run by Mr. Carl. In exchange for other nobles, even the baron with the lowest title will not be willing to have a relationship with their daughters. - In their eyes, these people are all so-called untouchables. <b r /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These... can you really do it? Even the nightingale, in the face of a huge monster like the church, is particularly powerless.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't go out of this step, never know the answer." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not expect the entire town to change his mind, but at least the new team he formed should be firmly in his hands, and later Rely on these seeds from within the people to promote their ideas.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months, enough to change a lot of things.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale was silent for a moment before whispering: "Why do you want to do this for the witch? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to liberate productivity, in order to gain more powerful power, there is a place in the future kingial order - of course, these answers are not suitable for this time. Although Roland is a mechanical dog, but various GALGAME have also played a lot, it can be counted as a battle, see more. Two years of experience in more than 20 years are reminding him, at this time they are facing a The answer to the key question.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He deliberately used the word and said slowly, "I haven’t told you earlier, Bianbu Town does not care about the birth. I hope that one day, even a witch can live like a free man on my territory. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
