			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime City Entrance Square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a continuous roar of machinery, and a spotlight shines like a white. The rescue work has been going on for nearly 16 hours. The "guard" rock surface sinks into the water and is in the tent of the temporary construction center, waiting for the final message to be delivered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people say that his heart is like a stone, and he will not be disturbed by emotions at any time. This is actually a misunderstanding. The embarrassing sacrifice made him feel sad, and even secretly blamed himself for not leading the team personally, but he was more able to distinguish the priorities of the matter. Before the situation at the bottom of the city was not proved, he was not qualified for sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the attack on the 04th evacuation well, the 01 and 05 wells also met the demon, but fortunately these people have already learned the squad The attackers were all annihilated at a small price. However, the statistical results still make the meteorite feel weak - everything is the same as that in the No. 04 well. The enemy is the lowest level of the association. At present, more than 320 bodies have been identified, which are close to the day. The total number of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the bottom of the whole era is already a foreseeable result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t know why these people chose to blend with the fallen core in just a few hours after the disaster – Prism City has a complete emergency system Even if the supply to the upper layer is interrupted, it is enough to persist for a while. They should be clear that the association will never give up any trapped person easily. As long as not all evacuation wells are destroyed at the same time, they will not be able to see the sky long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rock has no idea to guess what happened at the time, he just wants to figure out what the current situation of the central containment is - even if all the people on duty It has become a demon, and there are three hundred, and there are more than three thousand cores in the library. This is more than several times more important than his life. If it is leaked, the consequences are simply unimaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Shishi," At this time, a suit man walked into the temporary command center and whispered a few words in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it so unlucky?" The meteorite could not help but frown. According to feedback from the search and rescue team, when the erosion suddenly expanded, there were two martial arts tour teams from the Kajid Peninsula in Prism City. The mid-section support was engulfed, causing structural damage to the city's vertices, causing the entire slab closest to the erosion to slide into the flat cavity, just as the two teams were near the collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the current rescue situation is concerned, this group of people may not be optimistic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" The suit man has a difficult face. "One of the teams also has Kajiad’s star martial arts. If it is not handled properly, I am afraid it will cause Diplomatic crisis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Try to search, save one is one, what else can you do? This is not something we can control."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can follow the town to guard the short personality, and you won't necessarily appreciate it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;磐石沉默For a moment, "I know, this one will go down in advance, I will ask the president of Yunxiaocheng to coordinate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suit man just left, one The liaison officer suddenly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No. 01 has new news! They have opened the blockage of the pipeline and are entering the interior of the city!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Connect the signal to the home screen." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a snowflake noise flashes, the front line appears from the front line The returned image, the shaking lens should be from the leader's head-mounted camera. The illumination below the city vertebra is good, but the lights are a little flashing. Obviously, the emergency motor is still working. It is inferred that the transportation equipment such as the elevator must be able to be used normally, which can save a lot of time for the rescue work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one in the command post cheered, everyone’s eyes were attracted by the abrupt "red spots" on the screen - its outlines were irregular , but perfectly embedded in the reinforced concrete, as if a deliberately created such asymmetrical art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the two parts of the prism city that is split up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry about the damage at headquarters," he ordered. "I will go to the bottom immediately, and I want to make sure that the central containment is safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rescue team that received the instructions went all the way down, and did not encounter any enemies again, but the meteorite also did not see too many traces of fighting, all around were quiet, furnishings It still maintains a well-organized appearance, as if it was not a disaster place, but was deliberately abandoned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the team arrived at the door of the treasury, a sound of cool air was heard in the temporary command post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the meteorites couldn’t help but clench their teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of another "guard" angry flame was broken into two pieces. The upper body was stuck on a steel door that was several tens of centimeters thick. The clothes were almost burnt. ash. In the center of the steel door, there is a huge hole. From the irregular edge, it is forcibly drilled by a certain high temperature object. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid that at that time, the angry flames used to be the last barrier to resist the invaders. Unfortunately, even this did not stop the enemy from entering the shelter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is by no means what the Devil can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team took a lot of effort to open the library door, and the area where the fallen core was stored was empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The command post was immersed in a dead silence, and everyone looked at the big screen, and their eyes seemed to lose their looks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough... The squeaky fist of the rock squeaked, and he knew that the people on the lower level could not accept the fallen core for no reason! "Tune the video - I want to see what kind of monster this group of invaders is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blasted in the tent like a thunderous sound, awakened Everyone. The timely switching of the emergency power supply did not affect the entire monitoring system. Most of the data was preserved except for a few probes. The technicians who subsequently entered the well were quickly connected to the spare storage hardware. A video recording was continuously transmitted to the ground by the temporarily connected fiber optic cable, and the executives in the command post also saw an incredible scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the erosion expanded, several thick "blood" dripped out of the red cavity and squatted on the floor below. After the moments of the liquid-like things, they turned into human figures one by one. One of them seemed to have the ability to melt everything. In the blink of an eye, it burned through the floor and went straight to the bottom of the city. There is also a monster that is even more terrible. Almost one face can control the martial arts that follow the sound, making it a dreamless doll, and it looks like a low-level demon who is lured by the power of nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than half an hour, the entire lower layer was declared to be disintegrated, and the still alive people were stagnation and the core of the fallen, becoming the enemy's embarrassment. After the monsters swallowed the remaining cores, they directly melted a passage from the containment and disappeared into the lens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way of using power, the Rock is still seen for the first time, not to mention the enemies born from erosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t help but recall the monsters that appeared in the “artificial erosion” in the survivor’s report when the last association organized the joint annihilation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that...the idea that erosion can engulf everything should be changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there may be changes that may be eroded by good and evil - as far as the current situation is concerned, these are from erosion inside, and obviously do not belong to the demon The monsters of the people are full of unabashed hostility to humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the meteorite is also clear that even if the enemy is hard to deal with, as long as the martial arts players work together, they can always find a way to confront. The most important thing at the moment is to inspire people. If there is fear because the enemy is too strong, everything will be finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone, as you can see, this is not a simple accident, but an invasion of invasion!" He stood up and looked at everyone. High-pitched, "It sounds counterintuitive, but the truth is in front of us - let me make it clearer, this is a war! Their goals are clear and well prepared, just to seize us. The world! I will immediately contact the martial arts associations around the world and concentrate all the power to help Prism City destroy the enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
