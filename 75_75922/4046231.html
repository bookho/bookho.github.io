			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the next few drinks made Roland open his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some like coffee, slightly bitter but exudes a strong smell, some are like soup, delicious and warm stomach; the most unique one he even Can not find the corresponding taste in the memory, if you want to say, he can only create a word to name: Fire Dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a dragon fruit wine, but a fantasy dragon flame – the entrance is a burning sensation, like a lava pouring into the cavity, followed by a mouthful Jiaoxiang, as if the tongue has been cooked, and finally the scent of juicy fruits, mixed with a slight wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer you stay in the mouth, the longer the finish will be. If you put it in the winter, it is definitely a drink that you can't stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, is there really such a good drink?" Probably seeing Roland’s intoxicating look, the nightingale couldn’t help but show his figure and licked his lips. ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You will know if you try," Roland handed the cup to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a satisfying snoring soon after the night, and both eyes became a seam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have tasted it," Wendy said with a feeling of empathy. "It tastes really hard to resist."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking the full fire dragon wine, Roland tried to make a sigh of relief. "Is there any such drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eve Lynn shook her head. "I can't repeat the last result... The new ability is completely irregular."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't repeat?" Roland was a little embarrassed. After Wendy made a detailed statement of the test, he realized why the other party was upset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability can turn water, wine or other liquids into beverages, but which one is uncontrollable, or every time the finished product is Not the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It consumes much more magic than the conversion of alcohol, and it is only enough once a day, and the amount of conversion is quite limited, almost equal to the capacity of a barrel. - Roland saw the kind of barrel in the pub, about a barrel of wine can be stored in a barrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, Evelyn has used five new abilities in total, and he has received five different flavors of beverages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland feels full of regrets when he thinks he can't drink the dragon's wine again, or may never be able to revisit it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Eveline lost is probably here too. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the witch, the high-level awakening can be called a new life, and even have the opportunity to jump from a non-combat witch to become a fighting witch. Although he has repeatedly stressed that each witch's ability has a very broad potential for exploration, Evelyn from the sleeping island still can't completely reverse the mentality so quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows that she has always felt that her winemaking is very bad. Now it’s hard to evolve. The new ability has not changed in essence, but it has changed from drinking to more. The drinks, even the results are beyond control, the mood is even lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as a good way for him. Changing the intrinsic concept usually takes time to polish, and when a large number of auxiliary witches shine in the winter without the winter, the witch Their mentality will naturally change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to say that this ability is useless, he will never think so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voyage era that was once opened for the pursuit of spices, and the Silk Road, which flourished by the trade of porcelain and silk, have proved the demand for luxury goods. Desire, and these drinks are the undisputed luxury – the beauty of the taste, the unique feelings, and the brilliance of adding a touch of color to this boring world, no matter which era, it will be sought after. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it has almost no cost! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the dragon wine, if sold to the fjord and other kingdoms, it is not unusual to be a heavy golden dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
