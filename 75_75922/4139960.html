			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After skimming the position, the lightning climbed to the sky again, then... stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" McMillan raised his head and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn’t answer, but turned and looked down on the direction of Takira - in the dark night sky, two hundred meters is almost the limit of her visual distance If you want to find a demon in this condition, it is tantamount to finding a needle in a haystack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she can't see it. It doesn't matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning knows that the other person can see her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the direction of Tacila, she should be facing the moon at this moment, as long as the demon person looks up, it is impossible to ignore the black in the moon. Shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it didn't catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reason may be that the other person has realized that her speed is far from what she can. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gave up the unnecessary attempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This game is her win! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning took a deep breath and extended his right hand to the night. Although her fingertips were still trembling, she still braved the courage to erect the middle finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is what the maid taught her, a symbol of victory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she turned around and headed away from her camp, and told what she saw to Sylvie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The regular stone of the gods of punishment... I know." The latter recorded the approximate size and handed it to Aegis. Estimating the shape of the shadow and the position of the stone column according to the volume of the stone, it is a basic skill for the high-level members of the Quest Society. Soon, the corrected data is transmitted back to the observation room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are visual errors in this, it is better than a random fire. After Hilley used the eye of the magic to determine the position, he picked up the phone at the artillery battalion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, the first roar broke out on the fortress's position! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the flames that emerged from the fire are flashing like fireflies, they are still striking for the darkness of the plains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when more artillery was added to the attack, the brilliance of the muzzle even faintly reflected the outline of the position. Sometimes the flame tail brought out by the warhead will draw a short trajectory, as if it were a meteor leaping from the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end, the reverberation of the explosion continued, and the fertile plains in the sleep were finally awakened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good beauty..." Mai Hao looked at the hidden artillery position at a glance, and muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning stands in the wind and clenches his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Now, only the last level is left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esluck floated in midair, watching a group of mud indifferently The column rises up and down in front of its forces - this is the most threatening attack by mankind, and as long as the projectile falls into the army, it can take away more than a dozen native lives in an instant. And its power does not need to be revealed through contact, even if it is tens of meters apart, the iron piece that the projectile shoots out is enough to penetrate the armor and tear the flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is, it is not sure to block a direct hit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the report handed over to the Lord of the Cangwu, it named the weapon "Fire Rain." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there is also a "fire" that can continuously launch a smashing arrow, a "fire branch" that can be carried by a single person... The evolution of this is undoubtedly derived from the element of fire. Compared with the "inheritance and promotion" that Maharaja thinks, it tends to be an accident. In the diversification of abilities, the witch is better. If there is a suitable awakening in these hundreds of years, plus the long-term human It is not impossible to achieve a large-span improvement in the study of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is really dangerous is the fire that happens to cross the stone pillars and break into the "tombstones" group. Their armor and guns are incapable of being attacked in front of the fire, as long as they are slammed, it is basically the end of the quarter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irony is that Wang had high hopes for this sympathetic, sympathetic body that has neither pain nor fear, thinking that it is from "inheriting debris The most valuable breakthroughs obtained in the project not only greatly enhanced the replenishment ability of the front line, but also enriched the means of warfare of the ethnic group. Only one hundred tombstones are needed to completely destroy the human beings, that is, the lower worms in the eyes of most tribes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not many tombstones that Dajun has handed over to him, just one hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the battle for half a year is not only annihilated, but the tower is already crumbling. The tombstone that Ursuk can now drive is only less than 40%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Lord of Scorpio was not trusting the king at this point, how could it be so stretched now? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these symbionts are consumed on the road, it can only let the original body resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not much different from sending death. The impact of fire and rain on the pillars of God’s punishment is not the same as that of the original body. Even the blackstone of the tombstone Stone claws have the possibility of being shaken, let alone the flesh? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Erskuk doesn't care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these sacrifices are worth it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And humans... will pay for their sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 pm, underground command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle has continued for nearly three hours now, every five minutes, the iron axe will hear the dull shelling sound from the top of the head, while falling, still There are sparse dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, there is no movement on the position, as if the devil did not launch the general attack, from the beginning to the end, the first army was firing in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is quite different from previous war experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to save ammunition and protect the barrel, he has allowed the artillery battalion to extend the shooting interval and align most of the firepower behind the shadows. The problem is that even if such a blow caused a real kill on the devil, it could not be observed through the magic eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that can be confirmed at the moment is that the 152mm fortress can't destroy the stone. Although the intensive shelling can minimize the movement speed of the shadow, it will always recover, and it is not known how the spider magic has made such a big guy roll over the crater. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn," the iron axe hammered the table with an annoyance. "If it is daytime, these monsters will not live now!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest trouble that the First Army is currently experiencing is that no one knows where the projectile is - the artillery wants to hit the target, it has to be corrected by multiple test shots. Falling, but facing two blind areas that are more than 150 meters wide and are nearly infinite, each shot is equivalent to a test without feedback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Hilli’s observations, the demon did not break into the camp, but had been swimming above the shadows, apparently alerting for lightning. Although the speed of the latter is above the enemy, the high-speed flight consumes a lot of magic power. It is still okay to intersperse with the cold. It is always necessary to lie on the black shadow and get rid of the demon person while providing the location of the drop. The danger is real. Too high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to give feedback means no additional blows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, the rapid destruction of the enemy’s vital forces through intensive firepower has become difficult to achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation at the moment is like a bet. He can pour all the shells into the shadows, so that they can stop moving completely, but the enemy only needs to withdraw the spiders. The first army is equal to wasting ammunition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
