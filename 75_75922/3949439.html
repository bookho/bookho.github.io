			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe went into the hall and followed a standard military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tefico's troops are expected to arrive at the Chishui River Pass four days later, so the First Army will leave this afternoon," Roland said bluntly. The team in Bianbu Town will meet you at the meeting place, and I will rush as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the town not have to be fortified?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All the enemy's movements are under the control of lightning and wheat, and it is no longer necessary to split the defense. Just hit one side and defeat it." It was said, "And the long song fortress needs to leave a hundred people to guard the nobles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave here...here?" The iron axe glimpsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland will briefly explain the orders issued by the five people before. "The reason why I gathered them together is to facilitate the guards. After attacking the western realm, it is impossible to allow anyone to move their minds. The Second Army’s weapons are old and their combat experience is insufficient. When they encounter unexpected situations, they may not be able to respond. But with the 10th First Army soldiers, they can ensure that they are not I don’t want to be in the back of the Chishui River.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Follow, Your Highness.” He responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to go?" After the iron axe left, the nightingale appeared from behind the main seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course," Roland said, "If I don't go, who else can use the power of the lotus? I may not be able to command the battle, but the bunker." Road closure, tank face, that is my unique life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bunker I understand, what is the tank?" Nightingale confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...the carriage that dragged the artillery," the prince coughed twice. "But we don't have enough horses, so the artillery needs to be transported by the township." "You can't call it a tank."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you picked the honey?" She blinked. "As far as I know, she can Tame the tiger and the leopard to be docile to the horse. But can the artillery pulled by the beast be called a tank?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course," Roland I couldn't help but raise my mouth. "It can also be called Tiger and Leopard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Carter walked with a white-tailed pheasant. Come in, "His Royal Highness, there is news from Bianbu Town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolan clap your hands and see the white-tailed owl spread its wings like a spirit, freeing the Cavaliers’ arms to vacate From the gliding distance, he landed firmly on his shoulder. He took a piece of dried meat from his pocket and swallowed the bird. The latter also consciously lifted a paw, allowing him to easily untie the cloth tied to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This eagle is not a change of wheat, but one of the air messengers of honey training. They can remember five or six different appearances, as well as hundreds of flight routes, and by bringing them to a strange place, they can be connected with homing. This time Roland went to the fortress and brought in four messengers. They could travel to and from the two places in one hour and fly all day long without stopping. In the absence of a radio, this is the quickest way to contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland spread out the stationery wrapped in the cloth and quickly browsed it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sender is Wendy, who has carried Shanglian, Sylvie, leaves, hummingbirds and Nanawa to the Chishui River Pass according to her own requirements. There were also some artillery team members and eight artillery pieces on board the ship - this is also the maximum number of artillery pieces that can be accommodated on the town deck after lightweighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince estimated in his heart that when Wendy pushed the sails at full speed, the cement boat would take a day to reach its destination. Despite the fact that Sylvie is a navigator and the ship can drive at night, Wendy's magic is far less than that of Anna, and it can't be used without interruption. Therefore, if you rest at night and transport during the day, you can only go back and forth in four days, and transport up to 16 field guns to the river pass. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the number is not as good as the last time, but considering the unexpected surprise attack and the other side can not quickly counterattack on the ship, the gunfire is barely enough. Roland took the pen paper from the night and wrote a new order - ordering the garrison to carry weapons and ammunition to start immediately, and the large army of the iron axe meet at the river branch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
