			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After confirming that there are no signs of devil activity in the camp, a new investigative team is very Quickly set up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 is carrying Ai Gesha’s first departure to search the camp, and 50 First Army soldiers escorted Soroya and Axia, who lacked the ability to escape. The people followed closely to find out why the red fog dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are coming," Lightning gestured to McMurray, "lower the height."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"嗷!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha poked his head and saw that the rocky beach appeared a little bit in front of his own eyes. As the little girl said, the dense red mist has disappeared without a trace, revealing the dark brown earth. Unlike the dark green forests around, there is no tree in the camp, like the ground is torn off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time she has been close to the devil's home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the original secret society, Ai Gesha is a little excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning is about to land, repeat, lightning is about to land."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful, encounter Any possible danger, remember to flee immediately." The other side of the stone came Roland's voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning understands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheat smashed its wings and swooped toward the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenery under the foot has changed from the blue sea to the grayish white stone wall, and finally the wet brown earth. Ai Gesha felt a shock, and the huge beasts fell steadily on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The devil lives in such a place?" The lightning bolt is amazing. "I didn't think it was when I looked at it from the sky. It is really strange to see it now." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha has the same feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empty land is lined with dark stone towers everywhere, like a patchwork of black forests. The dark spots seen from the sky are basically from these alien buildings - The height is almost three or four floors, and the short one has just not over the top. In terms of intensity, it far exceeds those frontline camps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that in addition to storing red fog, these stone towers have other functions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although it is not clear what kind of changes have occurred to them, it should not be too far from the present," she judged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why do you say that?" Lightning asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the stone tower has not completely withered," Aegusa pointed to the nearest Blackrock Spire. "They just changed their surface, and they were still rough and fragile." Far away, this is completely different from the absurdity left by the Federation after capturing the frontline camp. It only shows that the devil is not planning to retreat, or that...the decision is very hasty." She paused. "We first Go to the center of the camp and look at it. It is the tower that the eye is waiting for. Maybe you can find something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that Axia can find out the reason - - Ah!" The lightning in front of him suddenly screamed and instantly sank into the ground, scaring the wheat stalks into a dove immediately, and Ai Gesha also summoned the ice to stand in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm fine," and the two girls did not wait for the next reaction. The little girl flew out of the hole and smacked the dirt on her body. "Who is here to dig a pit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a shocking little devil, Ai Gesha sighed, just preparing to disperse the ice wall, the other The next words let her heart come up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, there is a devil inside!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really," Falling on top of her head, "it seems to be dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
