			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... is this? I know." Hearing the front line The news came, Roland only felt that there was no sinking in his heart. After a while, he whispered back. "Your injury, what happened now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;After that, there is silent silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he spoke again, it was a few minutes later, "No, it’s not your fault. There should be no such thing at this time. Since the threat of the front line Has been lifted, come back for a long vacation, take a rest for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hanging up the phone, Roland leaned back on the chair and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale seemed to have expected something, not flashing to the table as usual, but step by step to him. "Is the phone call from the leaves?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah." Roland closed his eyes. "The war is over. The First Army captured Takira at a very small cost and was at the stone." In the pit, half of the tower was found. Although the ambush plan failed, the enemy slayers were confirmed to have been killed, and the curse no longer existed. It can be said that it was a blessing in misfortune, but..." Don, "Ember and Elena didn't survive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That - fool?" The nightingale couldn't help but slammed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Listening to the lightning, the ashes became the supernatural in the end, and died with the devil. There was nothing left in the scene except for a small blown hilt. Roland said slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before seeing the location of the ambush by the phantom instrument, he knew that the plan had a deviation, and from the arrangement of the devil, it seemed to be waiting for it. The witch is the same. It is a pity that the light curtain can only see the corner of the battlefield. The special action team decided to disappear into the field of vision soon after the west withdrawal, so that he was in a hurry for the next day and a half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at that moment, Roland had the worst plan in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final result can be said to be much better than he expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even then, when he was really informed of news of casualties, he found himself unable to relax at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he passed the ambush plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although the ash guy is arrogant and arrogant, at least every choice he makes is serious..." The nightingale put his hand on his On the back of the hand, "Erina is even more so, I believe that they have been prepared for this, you do not have to put this responsibility on yourself - the words to the leaves, the same applies to you."<br />< Roland nodded. He still doesn't understand why the devil can see through the whole action ahead of time. Even the goal of destroying the witch is more important than the holy city of Tacula, but the fact is no longer possible. Change - As the leader of the Grey Fortress and the united front, he must not reveal any depressing look in front of everyone, no matter what difficulties and setbacks should be encountered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If even he is caught in a trough, how can he support those who are more sad? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the problem that Roland is currently facing the most difficult to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the words of the leaves to the lightning, the relationship between the two is probably much closer than he thought. Although Tilly did not show grief at the time, she still placed the injured in the first place, but the disappointment in her eyes could not be concealed - it was like a sudden loss of words in the words of lightning. The gloss is average. As for why the little girl secretly conveyed the last words to him, it is estimated that he hopes that he can comfort Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Roland is least good at. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can only take a step and look at it, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The afternoon, the Seagull returned to No Winter City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland personally took the rest of the Alliance to the airport to welcome their return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna, Ai Gesha, Molly, Felice... Everyone walked down the ramp and hugged them with books, nightingales, and Xuelun. And the common clerks in the league, such as bells, gray rabbits, and pearls, are among them - whether they are fighting witches or non-combat witches, whether they are survivors of the new generation or the federation, or whether they are awakened or ordinary people. At this moment, they have no difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one is Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland walked over to her, "that..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can be alone with you Talk, brother?" Tilly Yang began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the castle office, Roland confessed to the nightingale and closed it with his own hands. The door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what do you want to say..." He just turned and felt his chest suddenly tight, and a figure leaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't move, please," Tilly hugged him, his voice trembled a little. "Let me stay for a while, just for a while..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of the back, her voice has been crying, and the fingers on the back are getting harder and harder, almost like being embedded in the meat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is also like herself - as the guide of the sleeping spell, she must not be overly sad in front of everyone, and the deeper the feelings, restraint The more painful it is. It is not easy to stick to it now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland gently patted her back and said, "No need to endure anymore, crying with confidence, no one here can hear..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜...呜......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly first issued a very depressing sob, followed by The louder the voice, the last cry he had never heard of - even when he was maliciously bullied by the Four Princes, the other party was not so sad. It is like a person who has lost the treasure, and the cry is full of sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for verbal comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he can do is to accompany her to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, frontline camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tent was opened and Sawyer came in with a bowl of fried potion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to drink this stuff again?" Andrea was vague. Her legs were tightly covered with gauze and her cheeks were covered with ointment - although there wasn't much healing, the cold touch at least compensated her for some pain. "I can't drink without sugar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... I am going to ask the medical team points?" Sawyer hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where the medical team will have sugar, it is not in the winter city. If you forget it, help me up."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia took it up and took the bowl to drink the bitter and painful painkiller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Cough, Nana is still busy, how long will it take me to get her treatment?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have asked, almost three or four days, she said that the witches who suffered the punishment of the gods are much heavier than you, and said..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yewei whispered, "I also said that your leg injury just looks scary, but not Deadly, just drink medicine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
