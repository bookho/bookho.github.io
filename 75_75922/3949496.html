			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, as the large hot air balloon was assembled, the ruins were explored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new hot air balloon is named Yuanwang. The huge hanging basket can accommodate more witches and is surrounded by canvas enclosures to avoid cold winds. The invasion of heavy snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the whole operation is safer to implement earlier, after simply saying goodbye to Roland, the witches boarded the hot air balloon and took off from the back garden of the castle to the stone tower. Progressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to meet the enemy quickly in the face of danger, Yuanwang was flying very low this time, almost passing through the roof of the town house. Most of the people who have witnessed this "miracle scene", many people are shocked in the same place, and some people shouted for the long live of Roland's Highness - probably in their eyes, such a miracle can only be created by the Bianbu town lord. When passing through the western section of the city wall, the first army soldiers were saluting in the air, whether they were flying with lightning or wheat stubble, they were all familiar witches, especially the little girl who often directed the artillery team to direct the shooting direction. The enthusiasm of the soldiers cheered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, in the scattered fluttering snow, Yuanwang threw the town behind him and entered the hidden forest area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly stood by the basket and looked at the boundless forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow season that lasted the entire evil month turned the world into a white one, and the branches at the top of the giant wood were all covered with snow, so look at it as if it were a prominent ground. The platform is flat and wide. On the other side of the perspective is a layer of mountains, showing a touch of blue and gray in the mist of the mist, invisible to the foot of the mountain connected to the earth, the peaks in the distance are like floating in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful scenery," Sawyer exclaimed. "I was the first time I saw the West under the snow."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a witch in the West?" Wendy curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I originally lived in the Dragon Ridge, there was a little near the south, and there was very little snow in the winter. Later I heard the news that Tilly’s adult came to open the island, I Only sneaked by boat to the clear water port to meet other witches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out," Wendy smiled and shook her head. "Our prince, my prince has been complaining. Why did the rumors of the Bianbian town settled in the town, but there was no witch coming... He was always a slow step."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you also have Let's release the message to summon the witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They have it, but unfortunately the man is not very old. I just noticed it when I arrived at the Dragon Ridge," said the ashes. "I am still catching him in Silver City. It seems to be called Tasa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also a witch, of course, will notice this strange Rumors, "Andreia grinned. "If you don't meet the adult of Tilly, you might have already followed Bentham Town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not be your lord of Roland-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh," she imitated the voice of the other party. "His Highness... is very skilled." "Well," <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Tilly couldn’t help but laugh out. She saw her face sullen yesterday, and now it seems to be recovering. The normal state. On the island, I dare to look for troubles at any time, and only the Andreas who is born in the world. "Whether it is in the island or in the town, it is our compatriots, don't separate each other."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and looked at the many witches in turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you leave, everyone has already understood each other's abilities so that they can assign tasks more reasonably when encountering enemies. It can be said that the fighting witches in Bianbu Town are far less than the sleeping islands, and even most witches are not suitable for fighting. But it is also their unremitting efforts to build the town into what it is today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly’s eyes stopped on Anna. If you want to choose one of them that impressed her the most, I am afraid that this woman who is awakened to the border of the land and has a deep influence on Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as I stand by her side, I can feel an indescribable weight and peace. This feeling is the first time I have encountered it. It is like lying on a vast field, and the softness and solidity behind it makes people feel at ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
