			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks after receiving the Shaun emergency, the sun once again appeared in the western boundary of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon moon ended without warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the most peaceful moon in centuries. There are no evil beasts and guns roaring. The snowfield outside the wall is empty and flat. The thick snow reflected the dazzling golden light in the sun, like an innocent mirror. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this year’s Victory Day has been particularly lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many residents did not wait for the snow and walked into the wilderness. They took a group from the deep snow and took it home to boil and drink. To celebrate, it is also a commemoration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a small number of people know that this is a submerged undercurrent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third side of the city, the library of books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland received an expected response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No documents are mentioned in any of these documents, even if the literature left by the underground civilization is the same." Celine leaned against the corner and piled around Full of open ancient books, "And the first record of the extreme south, about 860 years ago. It is a travel note, probably from the hands of a convenient witch, describing a few words, but can Confirm that the endless cape is desert at that time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first time he saw "sarcoma" showing such fatigue - three high-level witches are very Sitting down, usually relying on the main must hang on the dome, the thin whiskers on the body are always dancing. But now, the other's tentacles have fallen down, covering the surface like a fur, and at first glance it looks like a radish that has just been pulled out of the soil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You may have to take a break."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also think, the body can stop "It won't come down," said Serin. "Your discovery is too amazing. It can be said that it has subverted the federation. It is not true. It is the history of human history!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Roland has long expected the answer - if there is a relevant discovery in the Federation era, it is impossible to leave no words. After all, it involves a war of divineity. Even if it needs to be kept secret, at least the entire high-level should not be ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ethnic group in the mural may be more ancient than he imagined, and 860 years is only a well documented evidence, not representative of the extreme south before It is full of life. From this point of view, the myth of the folk songs of the Mojin folks, the "Three Gods Messenger" and the "Millennium War", have a bit more credibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the first battle of divineness has not yet begun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, not afraid of your jokes," she sighed. "We have made a big step in cognition, but why do I feel so confused?" It’s like losing something.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This is normal,” Roland said comfortably. “The more you know, the more you will find yourself. Nothing to know. In the end, all doubts can be attributed to three questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Which three?" Pasha curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where am I, who am I playing, who is hitting me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... ..." A sense of silence in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, well, I just want you to relax," Roland coughed twice. "The real answer should be who I am, where am I from?" Come, where to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where do I come from... Where are you going?" Passa muttered again, "Really These three questions seem to be very simple, but if you think about it carefully, you don't answer it very well. If you change your position slightly, you will have a completely different answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, have you checked the book?" Ayr couldn’t help but interject. "I have something wrong with this. I am Aer, from Takira, and I will Go back to Taqila - isn't that okay? I think you are being held by him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
