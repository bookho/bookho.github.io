			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hermes, the holy city, the underground temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefron has not been able to sleep for more than two months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as he closes his eyes, the ear will ring back with the tragic cry of Archbishop El. She was dragged back by the trial army. The enemy's weapon shattered her abdominal cavity, and the intestines became a pot of porridge. Even if all kinds of herbs were used, it could not stop the deterioration of the wound. After two days of struggle, she died in extreme pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Soly Dahl led the Pioneer Army to face the headache, Teflon had doubts about the strength of the Grey Fort. He repeatedly asked Mayn to think twice. After that, we should try our best to find out the details of the army and then make plans. However, Mayn was not moved at all, and he insisted that the main force immediately attacked the gray castle defense at the foot of the Cold Wind Ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the church may pay a lot of money, but he did not expect the price to be so heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is not expected is that the most elite power of the church, the unstoppable God's penalty force is actually defeated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the news of the Arabian Nights came, Teflon directly spit out a bloody foam and fainted at the top of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the incredible thing goes far beyond this one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure one did not return, and Mae’s majesty did not know where he was, until he gnawed his teeth and forced a group of people to break into the shackle. I learned an incredible news from the mouth of the agency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean is not the successor to Oberlin’s fancy, and the scepter and crown are the pure cleansers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City suddenly lost the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing Teflon can do is to keep the news underground forever - the group of people he brought, all joined the Privy Council. And he also became a temporary pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next month, Tefron spent all his time maintaining the order of the Holy City and reading through the secret history of the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the secret of hunting witches, the creation of the gods, the source of the church, the disintegration of the witch empire is also a little bit in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old bishop felt that the worldview was subverted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he exhausted all speculation, he could not imagine that the church was actually created by the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even the witch empire that has spread all over the wild has not stopped the devil's attack. Whether the gods are punished or the magic stone is printed, they are nothing but the legacy of the exiled witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the toe of the night, Teflon’s spirit was quickly drained, and in just two months it seemed like two years later, the wrinkles on his face. It has been as deep as the old bishop, and it has also brought a bit of sluggishness in the gestures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he knows he can’t stop, and once he falls, the church is really finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of trial warriors were selected from the reserve team, and the new archbishops and degraded middle-level believers completed the appointment and dismissal as quickly as possible, plus coexistence with the Holy City. The call for the situation has temporarily stabilized the precarious situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Teflon knows that this is the appearance, the damage of the gods can not be quickly replenished, and the young reserve warriors are fighting and the older generation. The difference is very far. If in peacetime, he still has the opportunity to make up for it slowly, but now the evil moon has arrived, and the attack of the evil beast cannot be stopped, and nothing can be said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the church alone cannot do this. He must unite the wolf heart and the aristocratic forces of the eternal winter, just like the four kingdoms of the past. The Hermes defense line is the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy to let the nobles who joined the church on the face of the church be obedient. Tefron can even imagine that when the church lost, the news spread to the wolf. In the heart of the winter, the aristocrats who still hold the territory and the knight will jump out and fight against him. Therefore, when most of the Grey Fort Army troops were evacuated from the North, he sent the last one hundred Gods of Prisoners left behind in the Holy City together with the Heralds to use them as a means of forcing the nobles to obey orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
