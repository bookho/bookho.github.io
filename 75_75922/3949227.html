			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A funeral is being held on a wasteland southwest of Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not appropriate to say that it is a wasteland. I don’t know when this uninhabited land has been blocked by Mao Shi’s short wall and covered with walls. The thick snow, as far as it looks, is like a layer of silver. Although one foot can cross the past, but to see it, Fanner can't help but think of the border walls - they are all the same color, the same shape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only heard of this ritual in the mouth of a traveler. When a great aristocrat or a member of the royal family dies, the family of the deceased will concentrate on the cemetery. Play the sadness, accept the mourning of others, and finally bury the coffin underground. The more noble the identity, the greater the momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the dead are better than the living, he thought enviously, what if the people in Bianzhen died? Go to the forest and dig a pit to fill it. I don’t know if the evil spirits have come to eat the corpses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death is no stranger to the residents of Bianbu Town. In particular, every winter, I went to the Long Song Fortress to take refuge. Everyone shrank in the slum shack, died of hunger and cold, and died of disease and pain. That is the norm. No one has time to go to sorrow. It is better to wait for the day to go to the center of the city to ask for more bread. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, His Royal Highness is going to hold a funeral for a soldier! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that he was unfortunately thrown to the ground while chasing the mixed species of evil beasts, and was bitten off half a head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna knows this unlucky guy, he is also the old face of the old district, no name, everyone called him Aji. He has a wife and two children. The big one seems to be six years old, and the small one just can walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is normal, this home is definitely over, the woman can find another man to live, but who would be willing to bring two oil bottles? Do you want to throw these two little guys on the side of the road, let them fend for themselves, or raise them, go to the bar to recruit the flesh business, and finally die from all kinds of strange diseases. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the prince of the prince seems to be really planning to honor his promise in recruiting the militia. The deceased will not only receive the full salary, but also an additional compensation. What is this? Fanna thought for a moment, ah... yes, pension. And this money actually has five golden dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, a certain amount of food and charcoal will be distributed every month, which means that Aji’s wife can raise even if she does not go out to work. The two children are alive. Well, these seemingly beautiful sayings are probably just comfort words, but Golden Dragon is real. He saw with his own eyes that His Royal Highness handed the pension to the chief Cavaliers and then transferred it to the Aji wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, how did he suddenly feel a little envious of Aji? No, no, Fanna shook his head and expelled these stupid ideas. He didn’t want to die but he was cheaper... and probably would be someone else’s wife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the payment was made, His Highness gave a speech, very short, but Fanner listened. In particular, the phrase "to protect the loved ones and the innocents, we will always remember", let him feel that there is a surge in the flow of hearts. It turned out to be the case. He thought, it is not difficult to find that in addition to bread and silver wolf, I always feel that there are more pursuits - at least this winter, they can survive, relying on their own hands, not the long-song fortress. Give alms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final link is to bury. Aji's coffin was placed in the dug pit, and the chief knight allowed everyone to line up. Every militia member, whether formal or substitute, took turns to fill a dagger with a shovel. For the queuing, everyone is familiar with it, but more than two hundred people immediately lined up in four columns. When it was Fenna's turn, he suddenly felt that the shovel had become a little heavy, and the attention of the surrounding players slowed him down every movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he stood aside, his eyes passed on the feeling to the next surrender. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aji’s tombstone is a pure white rectangular stone. The word above is not known, and he is not the first to live in this wasteland. People. Next to Aji, there is a block of identical stone with the top covered with snow. As everyone left, Fanner saw the new captain of the Second Militia, Brian, pouring a pot of ale on the tombstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is his last destination, it doesn't look bad, he can't help thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
