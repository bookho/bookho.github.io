			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later, Roland officially launched the steel bridge construction project. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean, let me raise two pieces of land in the middle of the river to fill the foot of the pier?" Lotus looked at the rolling river, surprised Q, "Don't you plan to build a real bridge instead of using a pontoon to connect the ends of the river?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Roland spread the paper in his hand, "Considering the impact of the river, the two pieces of land need to have a certain volume, and in order to slow down the impact, they need to be processed into this way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is... ...the appearance of the ship," Lian moved his gaze back to the drawing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, exactly the spindle type," he nodded. "As long as it is parallel to the direction of the water flow, its front is minimally impacted. The problem is, The Chishui River is nearly ten meters deep. Can you raise the river bottom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is not difficult to do, His Royal Highness," Lotus replied crisply "Give it to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of insurance, the vessel responsible for carrying the witch is the township, and the large cement hull is flat in the river. The helmsman is still lightning, and the sail power is provided by Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the past week, when the latter saw the prince, they would slightly look away, which seemed uncomfortable. To this day, Roland only saw that she looked up and looked at herself as usual, and when she passed the board, he heard a soft "thank you". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have to remember this credit on me," the nightingale in the fog whispered in his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The township quickly left the dock and headed towards the center of the wide river. Carter had pulled the twine on both sides of the river, with two reds on it. The tape is the location where the pier is expected to stand. After the cement boat traveled to the first point, the lotus stood on the edge of the ship and began to exert its capabilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw that the river suddenly seemed to be boiling, and they all surged upwards, forming a “mountain pack”. In a short while, gravel, grass roots and silt emerged from the raging river, and the water gradually became muddy. So, Roland thought that her ability could not only transform the solid ground, but also the water, and it would be easier to raise the water surface than the loose gravel. Although the rising river immediately rolled around, the riverbed had been lifted a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, a group of blue-gray soil floated out of the water, it looked very soft and gave off an unpleasant smell, and everyone couldn’t help They have caught their noses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in Roland’s eyes, this is a good fertilizer. For centuries, the bones of fish and other aquatic creatures, aquatic plants, and the dung of the inhabitants, Just a little bit deposited in the mud. If it is not inconvenient to transport, he would rather use the soil for fertilizer. Unfortunately, it can only be shoveled by hand and thrown directly into the river. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the first layer is cleaned up, and he finally sees the solid yellow-brown soil. The next step is to repeat the process until two pieces of land are All trimming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland expects the process to last at least a week or so, but lifting the land out of the water means it can be used directly, and the flowing river will continue to take away the sediment. If it is not protected, even the spindle-type land will not last for more than ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called Carl Vanbert to his side, took out a charcoal pencil, and painted while telling how the ground should be cured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean by digging a groove at the edge of these land and pouring it into the cement?" Today's Minister of Construction asked more than a drawing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No loss is an outstanding member of the Wangdu Stonemason, Roland is satisfied with his thoughts, he simply reminded a few words, and he immediately understood his intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, each length should not exceed five meters, and the depth should be controlled at about one meter. After filling the cement, let the witch lower the groove. Rice, so repeated, can form a cement wall that is directly inserted into the bottom of the riverbed." This plan was thought out after Roland saw the ability of the lotus. Since she can control the ground to descend straight, it must be able to build the structure on the ground. Bring them into the ground together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
