			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella looked at the map for a long while, "The madman is not a god warrior. Although drugs can affect their minds, they will not be given to them." Invincible will. In the face of a truly horrible enemy, they will still be afraid, and even turn and flee - the collapse of a million people, enough to crush us into powder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it won't be so easy. Most of the madman's candidates are the bottom believers of the church, and the judges will be the backbone." Jerry returned to the window, "and wants to get so much Believers, the unification of the four kingdoms is a necessary condition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How many successes does it have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Three percent? 50%?" She did not take it seriously, "come with the enemies that have never met, all the information comes from the ancient books of 400 years ago, how can I know that the odds are several? Don't forget what I said before... enough luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, It’s ridiculously ridiculously--putting the fate of all mankind on this gambling table, using a small number of chips to make a desperate attempt to make a small bet... a battle that has won and won is not exciting, The harvest outside is the sweetest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of human beings depends on the courage, wisdom, faith and sacrifice they display in gambling. She thought, this is probably the scene that the gods hope to see... The weak can't welcome its smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope you are right," Isabella grinned. "I am more and more curious now."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you curious about?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What would he do if the four princes of the Grey Fortress stood here?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo frowned, "Why, do you really think he can win me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thai Bishop Fryen said that the pure man he sent to the Grey Fort has not heard the news yet, and it has disappeared for no reason—and the Westward outpost mission of the man is exactly what you set. In addition, we have lost. Afra of the kingdom, the bishop of the bishop, and the cathedral of the long-song fortress..." Isabella said that it was paused. "Do you think that the church has been since the four kingdoms started? Haven't encountered so many losses? It seems that after the relationship with the West, it is always us who suffer, just like...the god is blessing him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "enough "Jie Luo slammed down the table. "You don't know anything about the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella gave a slight glimpse, "I am just joking." And...when did you see the gods so important?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suppressed the anger of her heart, "He is just a mortal! Everyone can Relying on nothing more than strategy and knowledge, and these will become part of me. Even if he has a good way to fight against the devil, the Federation will certainly be able to do better!" Jie Luo turned back and stared at Isabella, " When the commander of the church drives straight into the west of the Grey Fort, you will naturally know who is the darling of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella sighs when he leaves the library Tao, "You are more and more like a "Pope". "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo sat at the table without speaking, and the mood has not subsided for a long time, which is not common for her who has lived for more than two hundred years. If it is not the other party involved in the gods.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows what Isabella means, but she can’t explain to the other person...no matter who becomes the pope, Regardless of the original idea, as long as you have entered the prayer room, unimaginable changes will occur.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God"...is really there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that his thoughts have been disturbed, Jielu simply closed the book and walked to the top of the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the highest point of the Pontifical Temple and the Temple of Prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the dark door of the bookshelf, boarding a narrow stone ladder, Jie Luo walked into a closed room without windows. The room is only a few steps square, not even enough for a person to lie down, the ceiling is conical, and there is a magic stone with a faint blue luster embedded in the apex. Under the dim light, Jielu can faintly see the four walls. And hard floor. Other than that, there is nothing inside, it is hard to believe that in this cramped place, it is actually the closest to the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
