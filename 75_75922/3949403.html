			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the moon rose to the top of the head, the hot air gradually turned cold. Tassa sat in the garden and could see the pubs, brothels and casino windows in the distance. The ignition point is coming out. In the night, like the stars in the sky, it shows the prosperity of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only in the inner city of Wangdu, can you see such a scene - even after the end of the epidemic, nearly one-third of the civilians in the outer city are dead, It will not affect the minds of the inner city nobles drinking and drinking. If you listen carefully, you can hear the slight cry from the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This house with garden and pool was purchased by him for 150 gold dragons, located on the hillside near the outer edge of the inner city, even during the day. Not many people are hanging around. In addition to interviewing informants and exchanging information, he does not usually live here, but chooses to stay overnight at the hotel, or go to the underground trumpeter for a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adults, they are all there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person walks out of the room with an oil lamp, It was Hill Fox, who was lurking in his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put the candle up," Tassa nodded and walked into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dim candlelight, Hill and the other five sat around a round table, and saw the guards appearing to rise and bow down. Tassa looked at them with a blank expression, hoping to see if it was reliable from the other side's expressions and small movements. Unfortunately, Miss Nightingale has followed the fleet back to Bianbu Town. If she is there, she can make the most accurate judgment immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the partners of Hill, the members of the "Dove and Hat" Acrobatic Troupe, the Avengers who are full of resentment against the new king. A week ago, the dock siege warfare happened to be a ventilated letter that was lurking in the dream water. Tassa was informed of the mouse's night attack plan in advance. Now that the plague has gradually subsided, he decided to see this group of people in the king. If, as Hill said, they would be good seedlings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Besides Mr. Fox, others will briefly introduce themselves," Tassa said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Yanshan, an adult," said the most powerful man in the head. He is nearly six feet tall and his muscles on his arms are full of strength. "Playing Lux in the Acrobatic Troupe, has now joined the blood sail."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a clown," the little man sitting next to Rock Hill pointed to himself The nose, he looks the youngest of all, about eighteen or nine years old, "of course, it is also a clown in the group, but I did not mix into the mouse, but performed some tricks in various pubs." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Jom and Neil," the next two are a pair of brothers, no matter from the appearance or dressing, they are no different from the typical civilians in the outer city. They dedicated all their property to the priests of the priesthood, and now they are the "sincere believers" in the church. Tassa couldn't help thinking about it. Could it be that both of them had a good impression on Hill's wife? He pressed his doubts and turned his eyes to the last person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They all call me a magician, an adult," the other party said again. "I used to pretend to be a frustrated person into the dream water, but unfortunately they Most of the dead deaths, escapes, even the "murderous" Tanis was killed by the church's trial army, everyone is busy looking for a new home. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Due to the hand of the Judge? Tassa picked a brow. "Are they not the object of the church's secret support?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also heard from others," he spread his hands. "Tanis was defeated by the besieged wharf and returned to the Eastern District. The ambush, only a few dozen people left. On the night of the night, he angered and took the hand of the left-behind nest to find the church. As a result, only two or three cronies came back the next day. Hearing those people said that he had quarreled with the priests of the priests, and then he was pierced by the gods with a gun. In short, the dream was gone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that Tassa thought, presumably because of the loss of strength that was hard to accumulate, the murderous leaderâ€™s status was in jeopardy, and he wanted to seek church assistance. Rejected, and then caused by disputes. But this is an insignificant detail, he only needs to know that dream water is now in name only. No doubt this is good news, he may take this opportunity to draw a lot of nowhere Can go to the mouse to expand their intelligence sources.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
