			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting from the West..." Margaret curiously said, "I don't know if there is a good harbor that leads to the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now not yet, but we can make one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has widened her eyes, "His Highness, you are serious "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I should be able to build it next spring." Roland smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this era, the seaport is natural without exception, and the man-made port, a huge project that needs to transform the natural landscape, is almost impossible to achieve. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he is now fully supported by Tilly, and after the construction of the house on the Sleeping Island is completed, the lotus will return to the West again, then the evil beast It will also recede, it is a day suitable for opening a port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got up and pointed to the map hanging behind him. "There is a shoal in the south of Bianbu Town. The water depth is ideal and the area is very suitable, enough to accommodate all the facilities needed for the port. With a little modification and flattening the coastal mountains, I will be able to transport the goods out of the West."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Renovating the Shoal...Take the mountains Why are these horrible moves from your mouth, I will have the illusion that they are not difficult?" Margaret said with great interest. "However, do you own a merchant fleet? You must know the sea boat." It’s very different from a riverboat.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not yet,” Roland said. “This is why I hope you can participate.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am coming out of the boat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the same time responsible for transportation and sale," he added. Westland only offers merchandise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is equivalent to the exclusive distribution rights in the Fiordland region, Korea's experience, it contains natural can see profits. Self-organizing caravans to go to the fjord to sell naturally can earn more, but Roland does not want to invest too much energy and manpower in this area, he only wants to exchange new funds as soon as possible to maintain the rapid development of the territory. It is a matter of time before the completion of the original accumulation and the implementation of the credit currency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the businesswoman blinked and asked excitedly, "All entrusted to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If the price is reasonable." Roland nodded. "If you are willing to represent the overseas trade of the West, we can talk about it in detail. The scope of sale is limited to the fjord and must not be lower than the current sales to the Crescent Bay Caravan. The price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is, of course, the steamboat that does not need to rely on the wind to sail uninterrupted, it is worth the high price competition I bought it," she said with confidence. "If I sell directly to the islands of the fjord, I am sure I will double the price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The extra profit, we can share it together.” Roland laughed. “In addition, the main product has this in addition to the steam engine.” He clap his hands, and the guards waiting outside the hall immediately took a dish and walked in. There are four or five crystal clear glass bottles, each with a thumb size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open to smell."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margaret curiously uncovers the cork above the bottle, sniffs in front of the nose, and the eyes suddenly shine, "Oh my God, you made a perfume!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know what the products are compared to the Wangdu Alchemy Association?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The scent seems to be More concentrated," she said, holding the bottle left and right. Obviously, she couldn’t put it down. "Is this made by Bianque Town Alchemy Square?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Almost," Roland also picked up a bottle and put it in the palm of his hand. At his own request, the perfume bottle was made of crystal glass with excellent transparency and a standard six-sided prism shape. Turn the bottle slightly, and under the light, the perfume inside will change into different shades of color, which is very beautiful. According to the sales philosophy of later generations, exquisite packaging can greatly improve the grade of the product itself. As a fist product to open the fjord market, he naturally has to treat it with care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
