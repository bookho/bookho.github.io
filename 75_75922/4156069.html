			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter is true! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiris is right?-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the pit is what they have been The source of the magic to pursue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very complex mood rushed into the heart of Shanghai Kzod, and even made it a bit stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some things happen to be true, then some things naturally become fake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the promotion of a group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the book of Revelation, the source of magic is high, and it belongs to the realm of the gods. In any aspect, it implies that it is mutually integrated with the Red Moon. Failure to achieve all the inheritance of the race is not qualified to touch the field. Therefore, the sky has a sacred meaning to the ethnic group, and the mobile city that can float is thus become the god of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the source of magic is not so different - it is on a hidden island, at the same height as all races, and even Be lower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, there will be no additional benefits when you arrive here, Hecksod has neither felt the magic of cockroaches nor noticed newness in his body. The change, if you take away the colorful magic stone, here is an ordinary deep pit, with a strong, sacred and other descriptions are not at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome the promotion of the ethnic group in the tiankeng? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it’s a scam, how can you pretend like a bit? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If everything is as Isis said, then the thousands of efforts of the ethnic group have not become a joke...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The Lord of Heaven?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the watcher interrupted his thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there is a monster claiming to be stationed here for thousands of years and can easily disguise as a high-ranking tribe - from its performance, very Maybe know something about the battle of God! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the war for inheritance is an endless cycle of reincarnation, and it is very likely that it has seen more than one ethnic group that has obtained the “upgraded key”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or further...All rumors and revelations about God's will are circulated from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod did not expect the other party to be honest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It decides to preempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two twisted doors flashed past the other side of the body, cutting the hands of the watcher shoulders, then the legs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter has not reacted and has lost limbs. Its expression was fixed in horror, and then fell to the ground with powerlessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod has quietly confirmed with the colorful magic stone before, the watchman has no obvious light column, which means it is not magical. Outstanding, as long as you go to the hands and feet, the threat it can pose is very limited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, the Lord of Scorpio stayed in midair and observed for a while, confirming that the other party could not do anything except the painful low-lying, and then returned to the ground. A grabber in the pool of blood was caught. At this moment, its white yarn has been dyed blue by blood, no longer before it is soft and elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You'd better answer my question truthfully, so I can save you a life." Heikezod threatened, "What is the final outcome of the upgrade? What is it? Does the god really exist? Why does it have to set this scam? My patience is limited, and I immediately say everything you know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected Yes, the watchman’s face did not reveal the emotion of fear and hatred. It took a slight breath. “Why... you want to do this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remains buried in the ground are left by the competitors of a certain battle of the past. Now my family will follow the same footsteps and become the dust of destruction. You actually ask me why? The beasts are competing and dying, and the world is hard to exist just to please the gods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watchman stared at it, and there was a sorrow in his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that...you are not a lost person, but are prepared. Unfortunately, compared to the disappearance of ignorance, sometimes the answer is even more Desperate people - especially in the case of inability to change. The world does have a lot of deficiencies, but for you, it is already the best cradle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Shake... Basket?" The Lord of Heaven did not expect that he would hear such words from the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breath of the watchman is getting weaker and weaker, it lifts the shoulders of the blood, as if you want to touch Hekezod’s cheeks, "You all It is a child of the gods, how can it treat you as... please your own props? Now... it is time to leave, let's go... Don't go back to the island before you get the keys. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You haven't answered my question yet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not waiting for Haekzold After that, the watchman’s figure suddenly began to fade, as if he could no longer support the present. In just a few short periods of time, it disappeared without a trace. And with it disappearing, there are those stone monuments - very soon, surrounded by only the dense green grass and the marginal crater, everything that just happened is like an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the little blood left in Hexzod’s hands tells it that the female “high-ranking promoter” does exist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes it even more puzzling is that the other party is clearly disguised as an image, but after it really disappears, it makes it feel a sense of loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod shakes his head and pushes the lingering thoughts into his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least it confirms that Wakiris is still alive and closer to the truth of the battle of God than anyone else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing to do is to find a channel that can be connected with the nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has too many questions and needs to ask the other person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod stood up and was about to leave, and there was a sudden tingling in the chest! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end...what happened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It bowed its head and saw a prismatic break in the armor, and a sharp bone claw gradually emerged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "blade" of the Tianhai world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are almost transparent in their actions, and they are extremely concealed, and they can only be perceived by magical perception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn... When he was walking away, the Tianhai world actually sneaked into the island? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod feels that his power is rushing, and that he has all his attention focused on the watchman, plus the latter The unexpected answer distracted its vigilance, so that it was not the first time to find the enemy hidden in the thick fog. But what it doesn't understand is that in the past, such an enemy could not break the barrier of the high-ranking promoters, let alone pierced with the armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Edge" is only the claw used by the nest for hunting. When it is hidden, it is almost useless. When can it threaten the Maharaja? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tingling at the wound quickly turned into a burning sensation of burning. Obviously, in addition to sharpness, the claw was also stained with a certain toxin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod slowly turned back and saw a huge monster standing behind him, except for the sickle-shaped claws and the abdomen used to hold the prey. Outside the deputy, it is already difficult to relate to the blade of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the distant mist, there are many similar black shadows that are learning to climb towards this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original "watch time" in the mouth of the watcher refers to this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
