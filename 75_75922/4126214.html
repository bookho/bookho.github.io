			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian walked out of the camp and the winning fighters were coming back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the team that was fairly neat at the time of the expedition, they are like a group of refugees at the moment - bloodstained on the body, clothes can not see a good, not here Broken a hole, that is, there is a missing piece, obviously it will only be left behind after the extremely intense close-knit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the number of fighters is even more alarming. The ambush team of two thousand people can still stand back less than half. In order to transport the wounded, all horses and camels are no one to ride, and one ride basically has to live two to three. Together with the escorted prisoners, the whole team was very scattered and looked far away. It was not like a well-trained army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the faces of the people did not have a sense of depression, but they looked like they were stunned, and they were judged when they went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of the small tribe, defeat the big clan in the iron sand city, this is the first time in the extreme south! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian knew that after the war, they really turned from a hunter to a soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more satisfying to him is that although the ambush group is ragged and draped, it keeps his teachings in mind - no matter what time, the soldiers can’t Discard your own weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of people have lost their water bladders and food bags, and even some people have lost half of their new shoes, but the guns and sabers are still Hanging behind them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Army cannot always guard the Saudis for the South, they must rely on their own strength to make the tribes operate in accordance with the order established by the Grey Fortress - this is only gray On the superficial command of the King of Fort, Brian knew that what Roland had hoped for was not only that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needs more sources of troops, and the Mojin people need to be invested in the battle of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, these people have further qualifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunman’s captain turned around with satisfaction and nodded to Minda. “Now you can talk about the details of the battle.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the battle itself is concerned, there is no such thing as a slap in the face, but it is full of mistakes and mistakes. According to the plan, two thousand sand people are divided into two groups, and one group is pretending to be The bait continued to sneak back to the Yinchuan Oasis, and then went north and west along the Yinchuan to create an illusion of trying to sneak into the saline-alkali land. The other group ambushed in the last unmanned oasis at the end of Yinchuan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angry waves and the bone-cutting clan who got the news naturally would not allow the little tribe to provoke their majesty. A cavalry of more than 800 people departed from Tiesha City and followed. The footprint has caught up with the "defectors." Despite the large number of baits, they are not in the eyes of the small tribal Shamins who are not even watchdogs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two teams escaped and chased, and soon entered the ambush circle - this part was still implemented according to plan, but everything went wrong Set. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "bait" should first be dismissed and deceived the other side, and then find the opportunity to stun the horses and let the ambush group start. However, the sand people responsible for the road closure ignited the firelights in advance, and the fire immediately shook the sky. The enemy immediately realized that the situation was not good and began to break out in the direction of the past. If you don't prepare a lot of black water in advance, the ambush will probably fall short. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the battle became a chaotic fight, the bait group slashed the knife back to the enemy who had returned, and the ambushed troops could only join it. - Many people have only fired a shot from start to finish. The techniques of training the wheel row and alternate loading have never come in handy. The way to decide the outcome is still the most traditional melee of the sand people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Brian said, they are not just a weapon of the musket. Under the humming and blazing fire of the horse, this piece is already shrinking. The small oasis has become a battlefield for both sides. Flying over the rider, or being hit by the horseshoe, is a common sight in the sand. When the two are clinging together, the teeth can also take away their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little tribe is not without a warrior. From the time of birth, the sand people have to face the extremely harsh living environment, people who can survive in the hands of sandworms and poisonous donkeys. Basically mastered the best fight skills. It can be said that in terms of individual strength, the gap between them and the big clan does not reach the level of hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
