			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s now, guys, get off! Act on the content of the drill, fast, fast!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shouts from behind the carriage made Farina return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We also go to help!" she said to Joe, then pushed the door out of the cockpit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short period of time, the crew of the team’s counterparts are already busy. They hold the book and write and draw on the ground. A few bizarre instruments. Judging from the dialogue, those instruments seem to be used to position the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Farina is even slower and knows what the First Army wants to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They plan to bomb the enemy a few kilometers away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she has long known that the Grey Fort is best at using firearms to attack enemies from a distance, I understand that when she witnessed this scene, she still felt a touch. Sincerely shocked - any throwing weapon will be affected by the wind and its own weight, and the further the distance, the greater the impact, a little bit of disturbance will make the result change. How did they ensure that the warheads fired by the firearms were still flying as far as they could? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't that seemingly simplistic instrument predict the future? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is the case, it would be no surprise that the church’s fiasco in the Cold Winds was a battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this kind of technology is not enough for Farina, she consciously walks to the rear of the team, hoping to contribute to the unloading of goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the confidentiality requirements, the driver did not know in advance which people were on board and did not know which goods were loaded, but the team must have dragged it. Less things, this time more than one person can help at least speed up the preparation speed - she may not be good at others, but the strength is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation behind her made her stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a bunch of burly strong men carrying long wooden boxes with great efficiency, and those heavy towed firearms in their hands It didn't look so cumbersome. After the restrictions on the connector were removed, several people pulled the belt around the long steel tube and dragged it down the hardened road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised Farina even more was that she saw several familiar faces in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait... Isn't this the god fine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not wear armor, but from the strength, skill and appearance, it is clearly the outstanding warriors of Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, we met again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone patted her on the shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listening to this familiar voice, Farina jerked her head back, "Zuo...Zou?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect you to remember my name." Zoe grinned. "I thought you would still call out the leader of the Ainova Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath, "These people are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, they are all witches of Takira." Zoe said, "Look, I didn't lie to you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are hundreds of people like me in winter city, all used It is the body of your contribution. If you meet a familiar person in the future, remember not to make a fuss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party's words reappeared in the ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina didn’t know what to pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qiao went down to the latter deeply, "Miss Zoe, I didn’t have time to thank you last time. I have always felt very sorry, I can see you again now. It’s good. Thank you for saving Miss Farina.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That..." Looking at the back of the line, Farina couldn't help but open her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm?" Zoe stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you. And... I am sorry for the mistakes the church has made... I am very sorry..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The fault is not with you, you are just a blinded person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved her hand and did not return to the position in the erection Go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina opened her mouth, but in the end she only made a sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what she didn’t see was that Zoe left slightly tilted his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is like the iron axe said, as a driver, she is finally too busy to help, less than a quarter of an hour, first The army is ready to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Report, the first, second and third artillery pieces have been filled!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open fire! The commander decisively ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a loud bang, a gauze-like snow mist rises in the lower part of the base, and the roaring sounds in the mountains, just like rolling over The thunder of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot shell is discharged into the snow, making a sizzling sound, and the new shells are quickly filled in, waiting for the next shot. The whole process is flowing, and the tacit cooperation between the artillery is like the same person. From this detail, we can see how much their usual training has reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina realized that the gap between the First Army and other armies was more than just a firearm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten interest rates, she saw that the hills had finally raised a bunch of snow pillars! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ground forces began shooting!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi on the Seagull is more clearly seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three rounds of artillery shells crossed a long parabola, all falling near the fortress-type beast, the nearest distance is less than three hundred meters. The sudden explosion caused the devils around them to suddenly become confused, and several beasts fluttered into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After telling the correction information to the underlying artillery commander, she focused her attention on the enemy's movements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the reaction of the devil?" asked Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The main goal has not yet moved. There are only a few beasts that are currently taking off. It should not be long before they will find the truck team."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good luck." Andrea whistled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, luck is good. Hilli Wei nodded and nodded - in accordance with the plan made by the staff, the counter-attack team was prepared to be found before reaching the fortress, and continued to fire on the target with the patrol of the beast. The basis for this program comes from the experience accumulated in the Battle of Fertile Plains and the Devil's Pioneer. If the opponent is Erskuk, 20 to 15 kilometers is already a high-risk area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have just experienced a big battle, a large number of troops have been sent to Shenchi Bay, but as a very important "mobile obelisk", the fortress remains nearby There are fearful beasts and many defenders stationed. However, their warning circles did not make dripping water. For a long time, there were no fearful beasts flying over this area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the enemy did not find the counter-attack team early, Tilly allowed Hilli to continue to direct the truck forward until it was eight kilometers away from the target. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This only shows that the enemy has slackened after capturing the four cities! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a moment, the second round of shells also roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
