			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina accidentally discovered that the straw was still there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is only a few feet away from itself, it has not been pressed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background of the story of the Shadows is almost the same as the "history" in the mouth of the Taqila ancient witches, but it does not completely negate the church, when seeing the people in the drama In order to turn the tide and fight against the enemy of hell, she even felt that there was a heat flow that had not been felt for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the shadow of Hermes’s mortal high-level squad suddenly came across the opposite side, she clenched her fists, and wanted to go up and knock them down . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is these people who have led the church to forget the original intention of its establishment, from being needed to becoming a behemoth against people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most hateful thing is that those who know the inside story are tight-lipped in the face of the devil’s presence, but they cultivate the congregation with the idea of ​​salvation – which makes countless Soldiers like Master Tucker Thor died with lofty beliefs, but did not realize that they were only acting as a tool for their power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her loyalty should not be such a Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is, why does the king of the Grey Fortress show this aspect of the church... Is he really not planning to take this opportunity to completely break the church into the abyss? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, he didn’t take these things to heart? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Farina’s emotional turmoil, Hermes’s chase attracted her attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is a few quarters of an hour, she will not react - for the desperate, no matter what happens in the surrounding area, it has nothing to do with her. But now, she has a wave in her heart, and the power of the past seems to be back again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina itself is an elite in the trial army, and this change is enough for her to discover the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ground trembled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the voice of the trial army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been in Hermes for five or six years and has been very familiar with such movements. Even without her eyes, she can judge the number and distance of the people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16 rides, two squads - and the number of pursuers in front of them is exactly the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the touch is there from the beginning, she may ignore it. But the shadow is just a fictional illusion. Even if the performance is real, it can't replace the real. For example, you can't see your body, the touch still depends on the surrounding environment, etc... Because of this, suddenly feel more It is especially obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She realized that there was something - changed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina saw her body as this thought came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the hell is this...what? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However more incredible is still behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding viewers also appeared in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farina, we are..." He turned his head in a blank voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very unpleasant feeling came to my heart, and Farina slammed back, but did not touch anything - sitting still at the beginning The chair is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please help us, please!" The guardians and witches seem to have discovered their existence and rushed to the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The defectors are there, take them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrow flew and shot several people in the front row to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filmmakers are mostly the council members and the family members, and they have almost no experience in the battle, facing such a sudden change, all in the same place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn!" Farina whispered a curse, what the witches are doing, is this still an illusion? If it was before, she had already shouted "This is the evil trap set by the witch, everyone with me" to stabilize the hearts of the people. Resist the urge to subconsciously, she pushed Joe away and rushed to the crowd. "Stop! I am the captain of the Judicial Army Pioneer, Farina, who are you!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unexpectedly big drink allowed the chasing to grab the horse. "Pioneer Camp? How have I never heard of this team?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, who is your commander?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main sect of the Privy Council, Master Teflon." Farina said, At the same time, her hand back to the back, the keeper of the defection than a "give me a weapon" gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Hearing this answer, the warrior who led the team showed his color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, the guardian who was the mastermind of the rebellion heard of the name of the Privy Council. Any high-level who can touch the core secrets of the church should have a lot of influence in the church, but she also knows that this can only make the other person hesitate for a while, but can't make it change. The rebellion is now successful, even if it is big. The main sacrifice is higher than the weight of the new pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She must seize the opportunity and take the lead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the guardian did not fully understand her gestures, just cautiously raised the sword to her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why didn't you wear the armor of the trial army?" Probably made the decision, chasing the head of the army and turning over, with the men slowly coming up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because special tasks are being performed." Farina replied calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, because the defector is too important, I must bring him back to Hermes, this is your command. In addition, your people are best. Also take a trip with me - the Master of Tefron will be able to understand his will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to be?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The opponent's hand rested on the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, then I will take a trip with you," Farina said with a sigh. "As for Taiflen, he..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened to him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Already dead--" while she spoke, she was in rapid thunder In the cover of the ears, the spare dagger from the guardian's waist was taken out and inserted into the gap of the leader's helmet, "- after more than three hundred years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The blood suddenly sprayed her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Team, Captain!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kill them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina won the leader’s weapon and battled with the chase. At this time, the guardian also swept the sword as if she was awake and joined the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This woman - good, strong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell, what? Quick winding ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't let go of the witch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene is chaotic, from time to time someone is bored Falling down, and the rest of the audience has been in a state of sluggishness, and they are not afraid to bounce in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Farina, this is a battle with no chance of winning. Armored against armor makes it difficult for her to even kill if she can knock down the opponent. The damage, plus the difference between the number of people in the sixteen to two, she was cut off by the chaos is sooner or later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina felt a long-lost satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How dare you be enemies with the church!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Church? No... you don't have to mention this name at all!" She glared at it. "It shouldn't be like this. You personally destroyed it." You have lived up to the expectations of too many people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, she will soon die here, but Farina found that this is the best for herself. The ending. Even for just a short moment, she finally became the kind of person she wanted to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But death did not come as expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid gunshot broke the sword's crossfire, and she went back and found that the black man who was originally outside the courtyard did not know when it appeared in the shadow. in. Their reinforcements reversed the situation - the enemy seemed to be scared by the helpers who appeared out of thin air. They left their companions and fled, and quickly disappeared into the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you..." The guardian of the wound went to Faarina with the support of the witch. "I thought the church was completely controlled by the father. I didn't expect to encounter an upright warrior like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought there was no hope, but the gods did not seem to give up on us." Witch face There are still tears hanging, but at this moment it is broken into laughter. "You are not only saving us - all human beings owe you a love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I... ..." Farina opened her mouth but didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will go to the Grey Fort and tell the king about the changes on the Hermes Plateau, hoping that everything will still be available." The Guardian solemnly said, "You Let's go soon, don't go back to the holy city. If one day the church can get back on track, I think we will see you again. Take care, friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the two men slowly left, the view was dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light returned to normal, she found herself still sitting in the viewing room, and the seat behind it was still secure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the wounds in the battle have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So...the ones I just saw are really just hallucinations? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God...this is great!" At this moment, the audience finally came back, and the audience suddenly burst into a deafening sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three gods are on, I feel that I am changing history..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is The master of drama can see such a shadow, not to mention fifty gold dragons, one hundred are worth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you rushed up I’m scared to death, but it’s just a false alarm,” Joe patted his chest. “It’s incredible to think of such a scene and make the people in the drama alive...”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina did not answer, she noticed that the black man looked nervous, looked around with a gun, not like the performance of the pre-arranged. There are also two theater staff who rushed straight into the background and looked surprised and surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not like the performance of a show after its success. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she held her breath and further captured those details, she suddenly heard a faint explosion, as if it came from far away. At the same time, people's screams, crying and cursing sounded intermittently, but it was insignificant in the endless discussion and praise of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not right--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina realizes that something is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood up violently, ignoring Joe’s surprised eyes, crossing the head of the audience in the back row and running outside the cinema. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop! You...wait!" The black man who noticed this scene wanted to stop her, but it was obviously a step later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
