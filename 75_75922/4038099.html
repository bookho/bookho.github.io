			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After climbing a dozen floors, Roland only felt sore on his feet when he relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old building has no elevator at all, even in a dream, he is glad that his position is not the top floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that it must be Jieluo, but it is not exactly Jieluo--because no one will retaliate in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working hard to create a strange dream, the only role is to let myself witness her failure, not only depriving me of being a pure memory, but also becoming a Junior high school students who have no strength in their hands? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, Roland had a lot of evil thoughts in his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Jie Lu’s current appearance, no matter what she does to her, she has no resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this also considered revenge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can only say that what did Jielu did at the time, so that the memory has undergone an incredible recast, but the final result is not what she hopes. saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this large-scale package is a faithful reflection of Jielu’s memory, it’s just a building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the distance, the skyscrapers and the rushing vehicle pedestrians on the street, obviously belong to his memory - a soul from the modern world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo and the person she swallowed into the dream as a modern person, shows that her attempt has completely failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a more reasonable inference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what about himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland slowly walked downstairs and thought about the problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not belong here, at least, he does not belong to this loser building. One of the most striking features is that he still has a complete memory, knows that he is in a dream, and can leave the place at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he has to order a more convenient fall tool, hit the back of the sofa and hit the head, this time still feels a dull pain, indicating the dream The true degree of truth has reached a level of realism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, what step can it do in abundance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have all-inclusive or only one empty shell? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland returned to Room 0825 and carefully checked the residence again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standard one-bedroom and three-bedroom rooms have no balcony. The three single rooms are Roland's bedroom, Jieluo's bedroom, and a utility room. There are some large objects in the utility room, such as an old-fashioned bicycle that is not available in a speed-regulating flywheel, a sewing machine, an iron door that has been rusted, etc. It is estimated that it is worth a few dollars to sell scrap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he went to the door of Jieluo’s bedroom, and there was a clear notice on the door panel: no entry was allowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this kind of warning is nothing in the eyes of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed the door open unceremoniously, and a faint fragrance floated into his nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small room, the furniture is neatly arranged, the beds are stacked with quilts, the clean table and the floor are not stained, it is hard to believe This is what a junior high school student can do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Roland turned around, his eyes were quickly drawn to a cartoon diary on the corner of the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She actually has the habit of writing a diary? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, there is no psychological pressure to peek at a little girl's diary in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland picked up the pink book and found a plastic lock on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this kind of thing is completely difficult to beat him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the plastic lock is to add a heart to the child, and does not prevent the peek, Roland found two toothpicks, inserted into the keyhole After a few drums, the lock was opened a few times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the first page, the writing on the paper is immature, but there are very few ink spots and alterations. Obviously, when she wrote these things, she was quite seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On February 16th, because of the relocation of the school, I was pinned to a family in a different place. The owner was Roland, a very uncle who was not very particular. His Work is to work in the bar, often sleep during the day, go out at night, until the early hours of the morning, there is always an unpleasant smell of wine. I don't want to live here, but the family said that he asked for the least boarding fees, but also for food, I am not allowed to say a little more, otherwise I will send me to the country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this damn background? Roland couldn't help but lick his teeth. From small to large, he went to the bar a few times, not to mention working there. But the dream itself is an unreasonable place. It often splicing together multiple unrelated pieces, and it doesn't feel strange in the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he is too lazy to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On February 27, I started school. Uncle Roland seems to have lost his job. It looks very decadent, dinner has become instant noodles, or I bought it." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On March 2, the most recent pocket money was spent on the noodles. This will not work, the magazine said that the 12-year-old is a long body." When I have to ensure enough nutrition, I have to negotiate with my uncle. If I am detained, I will... I will bear it again. I don't want to go to the country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "On March 3, he agreed with my proposal, great! Every month he will give me some living expenses to buy fresh food. But as long as I am not at school, I have to come for three meals. Do, who is this who cares? Who do I think he should give me a salary? No matter what, I am used to doing these things at home. I am used to it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On June 8th, after three months in the new city, I have gradually adapted to this place. I have made many friends and my grades are also in my class. Ok, Uncle Roland, though not very particular about it, always does not trim the margins, but it is actually not a bad person, at least never hit me. Unfortunately, he still has not found a job, it seems that he is about to give up, this is not a good phenomenon. I can't support me and him by relying on the cost of living at home. I have to find a way to help him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"June 22, 唔... It’s hard to make money. I drew some cartoons and sold them to the classmates of the cram school, and finally I earned fifteen pieces. This is not enough for two days. Right, recently, the tone of the uncle is too casual. He is an adult after all, it feels a bit polite, but he can't control it. Is this a rebellious period?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"June 25, Day Where, I was scared to death today. When I entered the door, I saw Uncle Roland fall from the chair. Fortunately, there was a sofa underneath. The chair was so high, could it be that he wanted to commit suicide? It was so irritating, in case of bruises. Isn't it even more difficult to find a job? Forget it, ask him what he is going to do tomorrow."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save the insignificant details, Luo Lan went to the whole diary in half an hour, and also had a general understanding of why Jie Luo lived with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dream seems to have created a background that conforms to modern identity for everyone, which is undoubtedly an extremely complicated structure, and it’s impossible to rely on his own brain alone. Finished, it is no wonder that after the soul duel ended, he was in a coma for almost two months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the diary was locked back in place, Roland couldn’t help but groan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a stack of books on the side of the desk, which seemed to be a little girl’s textbook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swallowed and reached out and moved all the textbooks over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
