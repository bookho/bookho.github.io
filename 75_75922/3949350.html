			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer licked the lipstick tea and leaned back on the soft chair of the lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been more than two months since I took over the long song fortress, and he found himself more and more like this hall. The step-by-step structure that allows him to stand from the main seat overlooking the officials and attendants standing underneath, the feeling of being in the grip makes him satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first month, there will be some small aristocrats jumping out to openly question themselves, or secretly planning riots and the like - of course, provoke them behind the scenes There are ten major families from the elk and the wolf. Pei listened to his father's suggestion, and sent all the civilians or underground mice without the title to the gallows. The small nobles with the title were imprisoned and deported from the West after the family paid the ransom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of Thunder means, the situation quickly subsided. After all, except for the honeysuckle family, the knights of other people have been arrested in Bianbu Town, and it is impossible to resist Pei’s policy from the bright side. Afterwards, he divided the interests of the fortress into a part of the compensation for the loss of the big family at the time of arrest, so that all the nobles temporarily formed a relatively stable interest group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the income of the fortress is paid up to 30% of the border town, the remaining 70%, 30% is used to maintain the city's operation, and 20% to appease the rest of the aristocrats. The territory of Ermen received the remaining 20%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the portrait hanging behind the lord’s seat was replaced by the four princes Roland Wimbledon, and he is looking forward to hanging himself one day. Portrait of Pero Hermon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can have a long-song fortress completely, your own count will be able to form a piece with the fortress and become a veritable land of the Duke, and the 50% of the surrender and appeasement will also be Can save and invest in the business trade of the fortress, in exchange for a more generous return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the premise is that Roland can successfully climb the throne and become the king of the entire gray castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult," a guard went into the lord's hall and handed a letter, "It's news from Bianbu Town."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the word Bianbu, Pei immediately sat up straight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the envelope and smoothed the thin papyrus, as can be seen from the inferior paper, the letter came from his placement in the serf team. Eyeliner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the battle more than two months ago was incredible. Although Pei did not go in person, he heard a bizarre story from his father. In order to understand the reasons for the failure of the Duke, he arranged a lot of confidants in the hands of the town, they disguised as craftsmen, herders or serfs, and sent the information they saw back to the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that other families will certainly do the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But so far, except for the two men who pretend to be serfs, new information is still being sent every month, and the craftsmen and herders have no news, as if they have disappeared. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, did they betray themselves or were they discovered by the prince? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and focused on the secret letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the letter was written by charcoal, the text was twisted, and some places were still flooded, which appeared to be sneaked down during work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first paragraph says that an unidentified iron tower is being built on the bank of the Chishui River. A huge iron can is stacked on top of the tower. At present, three erects have been erected, each of which is close to the fortress wall. The blacksmiths seem to have finished the production of the tower in the town, and when it was transported to the river, it was a whole. Then there will be a first army soldier standing upright around the tower, and by the next day, it will stand up magically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Building"...This is the word again. Pei Luo thought, the last secret letter is also like this. If you look at the information, I feel that the prince is constantly building small. The town, the last time was the road repair bridge, this time is the iron tower. Is it necessary for His Royal Highness to take all the golden dragons that have been searched from the fortress castle for a sigh of relief? Moreover, the tower is still unclear... It is necessary to know that the spies in the hidden serfs are not true serfs, but rather well-informed guards. If it is a sentry tower or an arrow tower, he will be able to see it at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
