			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The scene sounded a sigh of cool air, and everyone looked at Zoe in unison - Camilla connected two souls Since one side has disappeared, the devil is unlikely to just lick his tongue, and then there is only one possibility left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aer’s reaction was even faster, and when the housekeeper exclaimed, she had already taken action. The master who was enough to crush the tortoise's torso swept away toward Zoe, and straighten her to the ground. The strength of the slate from the back of the other side can be seen one or two. Obviously, this attack did not consider leaving it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A blood spurted out of Zoe’s mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hall was in a strange silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that Elx’s move to prevent the devil from occupying Zoe’s body and thus provoke an upset – spiritual resonance compensates for the lack of perception control. Once the gods are allowed to open the field of banned magic, even if there is only a small gap, it can cause great harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially most of the witches present were not prepared to take Zoe as an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that Els, who used to be the commander of the Holy Brigade, is indeed much better than the crowd in the experience of the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Zoe did not make the final struggles as they imagined, or they did not hesitate to die. From the devil's screaming announcement, to the lord's need to press down, she is as quiet as a doll, and she does not see signs of being controlled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the devil's soul really moving into this body?" After a while, Roland broke the silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never encountered such a situation..." Camilla still has a lingering fear. "The soul resonance can be understood as a bridge, but it is Is another form of communication method - abandoning the intrinsic body and directly invading the heart of the connector, how can this be done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a way to confirm? ?" Tilly frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unless it takes the initiative to open it." Elsson loosened the main, but remained in a state of imprisonment. "It’s just that the possibility is not small, the soul can’t leave. The existence of the carrier, otherwise we will not rely on the underground civilization so much - self-annihilation awareness is not impossible, the devil does not have any benefit to it, so we have to do the worst." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I may have a method," Roland thought. "If you put Zoe's light column into the world of dreams..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I disagree!" Wendy immediately stopped. "For you, any risks should be avoided."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, what if the enemy encroached on your body?" The nightingale also echoed the road. "It is not the defeated soul battlefield, but a real high-order devil!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The risk is not uncontrollable," Roland slowly thought about the countermeasures, "if it can really enter the dream The place of appearance must be fixed. As long as a team of gods and witches are arranged to dream together, they can completely destroy it before it reacts. Moreover, the dream world resonates with the soul is not the same thing, no matter what happens inside, it will not affect. To the reality, as long as you wake up, the time in the dream will solidify, and any outsider who does not belong to it will be forced out. So even the worst situation, that is, Zoe disappears, the devil replaces her, we can also get confirmation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..." The nightingale bit his lip and turned to look at Anna. "You also advise him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't object to him doing this." Anna was unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Wendy and others couldn't help but see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I was saved by him like this." She replied earnestly. "If someone had discouraged him because of similar statements, I am afraid I will have long been I died on the scaffold. Now let me do the dissuasion. First of all, I can't convince myself. Besides, I believe Roland's judgment - he must be clear that he is no longer single."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
