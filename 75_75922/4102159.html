			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I saw this familiar city again, Isabella couldn’t help feeling a bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, in just over a year, the church has become the obstruction of the war of divinity from the only hope of mankind to defeat the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she has lived here for a long time, she does not have much affection for the church. The teachings of O'Brien's day after day let her understand that the result is always more important than the process. If it is impossible to block the devil, all gains and losses are meaningless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She carried out this teaching, chose the more promising Dilu than the Archbishop of Mein, and after the defeat of Jeolla, it worked for Roland Wimbledon. If there is a leader with more potential than Roland, she will still make similar choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interests of the individual, she put the continuation of humanity in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to say that, Isabella’s heart still has some unforgettable regrets - just she can’t figure it out for a moment, what went wrong . It was not until she returned to the old holy city that she understood it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels sorry for Jieluo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jielu as a pure person who has experienced a long period of time, should be separated from her; there are also many pure people secretly complaining about the moodiness of the winners, but unexpected Yes, she feels that the other side is inexplicably good. Compared with those who are self-conceived and who are involved in other demands in the battle of God, the idea of ​​Jieluo is undisguised, and its belief is far from others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella found that there is not much difference between Jielu and her, the only difference is that she is more accustomed to standing in the position of the assistant. And Jielu is the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably not related to nature, it is only an inevitable choice after the other party has lived for more than two hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can meet Roland in ten years, the Holy City should not become what it is today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately everything happened too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two rounds of circling, Mai Hao landed steadily in the camp outside the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are here, go on," said Ai Gesha behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella nodded, rolled over and jumped from the behemoth, and immediately the soldiers greeted him. "Itis is already waiting in the account. Please ask me to come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides her, Roland also called Mai Hao on the ice witch and told her directly Still in the "penalty period", it is necessary to act under the supervision of other witches. Isabella didn't care too much about such "straightforward". She didn't wear the lock of God's punishment, her hands and feet were innocent, and even her clothes were brand new. This is what she did not expect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the tent, a woman smiled and stood up from behind the table. "I am Itis Kant, a member of the Defense Department, and also fighting against the Holy City." The temporary person in charge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mortal with outstanding looks, Isabella thought. "I thought that you would first control the Hermes Plateau and then regain the old holy city in the west."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The plan is like this, but the people in the morning are coming. It’s too fast.” Itis told the situation roughly. “The command of His Majesty is to ensure the safety of the monastery. This is not a problem. It’s hard to transfer the orphans in a safe and orderly way. If I remember correctly, they all grow up in church education. If forced to drive, I am afraid that it will have a counter-effect, so I think you may have a way. After all, before the expedition, your majesty will give this task to You are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabella can't help but frown. "Wait... are you coming from the clouds?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, what's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is the main point of the church's focus on the defense, it should not be true It’s right for people to guard.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The church has been in this place for hundreds of years, and it has been clear that all the grass and the stone are clear. How could it be such a path that is not controlled by the city wall.” Isabella shook her head. “Let the smugglers pass only the gang.” People deliberately did it. It was originally prepared to deal with the evil kingdom of the four kingdoms. Its sentinels are set in the natural caves between the mountains, and it is normal to be ignored."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Will it be because of the collapse of the order of the Holy City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The warning order of the ladder in the cloud is still outside the wall Above, it is difficult to see such a situation." Isabella’s heart was quite surprised. Is this like a collapse of order? It’s almost like escaping from abandoning the city. "If you can, it's best to let me go to Hermes to see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First solve the problem of the monastery," Ai Gesha Remind, "Can you see the situation in the courtyard from the air?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed, Miss Lightning has already viewed all three major monasteries. And found a big trouble - the orphans inside seem to be organized, as if they are ready to stay in the courtyard, which is one of the reasons we have not taken action." Itisus, "I I don't want the soldiers to defeat the morning army unscathed, but they lost it here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is there someone organized?" Isabella indulged for a moment, "Let me Go in and talk to them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wanted to say one People are enough, but when they say it, they come back. "No, Ai Gesha will follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br />< Br />& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Isabella adults!" When I saw Isabella, Maggie stood up straight, and her right hand subconsciously pressed to her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking many times, you don't have to pay respect, just call the name," she said with no expression. "We are no longer pure." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, adults!" Maggie hurriedly nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabella sighed in secret, while her majesty prescribed her scope of action, but did not bind Maggie, vanilla and others. Later, they occasionally ran to the diplomatic building to find her, and by the way talked about the novelty in the Witch Alliance. However, they still carry the habits of the monastery, and they have not completely changed it yet... Fortunately, Gesha does not mind these details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take us in." She pointed to the city not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the First Army not going?" Maggie summoned the magical ark and looked at Itis after seeing her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will not enter the Old Holy City until security is guaranteed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ark quickly sank into the ground, leaving only a transparent ceiling – through the soil above the head, you can see lightning in the direction of the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are four monasteries in the Old City, it is actually equivalent to one. They are built around a reflection church. The ground is connected by a passageway and a secret passage leads directly to the secluded temple in the mountain, mainly to facilitate the delivery of new witches to the transformation ceremony. However, since the awakening of the extraordinary people caused a monastery to be burned, the connecting passage was closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Ark quietly sneaked into the West End monastery closest to the outer circle, as Lightning said, the vast courtyard is empty, the lobby door station Two girls with yellow-skinned skin, the long guns in their hands are taller than their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floor up, send it here." Isabella opened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't dive in and see?" Maggie asked in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are too many hidden god stones in it, there is no need to take this risk." The main place such as the monastery often places giant stone, covering more than 100 steps. Far beyond her scope of elimination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ark quickly jumped out of the ground, causing a panic in the watchers - in their eyes, the two almost suddenly appeared in the courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
