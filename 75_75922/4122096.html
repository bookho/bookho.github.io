			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Akima took a deep breath and pointed to Roland’s desk. "In your drawer, there should be an equal thing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly," the other smiled, and then placed another box on the table. "But I am a bit curious, why do you call it?" Is it "equal" rather than "identical"? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because...the reaction of the two is different, although they are all at the source level, the first one is more intense. Ajima described the scene she saw.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So can you find the third equivalent?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Please let me give it a try. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dive her mind and felt the green light in her hand again - because the previous goal was too close, she ignored other instructions. After the spirit, Ajima quickly found three other extension lines, which point to the east, west and north directions, which means that at least three sources are currently larger than the holdings in her hands. But what puzzles her is that those indicator lines though It looks very thick, but it is made up of countless faint filaments.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ability feedback message is given, the other person thinks about the location Nod, "That is, you can't know how far it is before you get close to the source." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So first east, then north," Roland quickly made a decision. "The west is going to enter the wilderness, and the danger is too great." If you haven't found the source at the seaside, it is not too late to turn north. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akima hesitated, still asked the doubts of his heart, "Your Majesty, is this thing... more expensive than gold?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not a fighting witch, the means to protect herself is extremely limited, if this thing is really so expensive, once the news leaks, can not complete the task, I am afraid even her The life is to be thrown on the road.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably seeing her worries, the young king laughed. "In fact, it is both precious and worthless. - For those who don't understand it, it's just an ordinary stone, no ornamental, and no effect. But for me, its value is far above gold, and it is also the key to unlocking the radiation mission line. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;璀璨 radiation? Is that what? Ajima finds that she understands it, but she doesn’t understand anything when she thinks carefully.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But taking into account the uncertainty of the road, I naturally won't let you find it alone. Roland pointed to a guardian around him. "His name is Sean, the protector of your trip." In addition, there will be an engineering team that has been taken out of the First Army and will be on the road with you. The mission is to give the source the first priority, so if you need other land officials to cooperate, you can let Shawn go. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean... let those lords do things for me?" "Akima is surprised.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is it? Roland shrugged. "They are no longer the owners of the past. Obeying the central order is their responsibility." He made a slight meal. "Because the source search time may be delayed, the salary can be paid 30% first, and the rest is issued once a month. This is the whole contract." So what is your answer? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akima thought for a moment, "Your Majesty, can you send these pays to Doris?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no problem in principle," the other side raised, "If you wish so." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I accept the job." "She is saluting. "I will be ready to go off tomorrow morning. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are still many things that don’t understand, but at least... she no longer has to worry about the dilemma of life, and the task can’t see what’s wrong. Reasonable place, let alone the assistance of the First Army, it is only a matter of time to find the source smoothly. Then with the reward of 50 Golden Dragons, the life of the partner can be greatly improved, she can’t wait to be more Lisi shares this good news.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
