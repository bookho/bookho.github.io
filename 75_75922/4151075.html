			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the difficulty of the two radio communication devices is not at one level, at least the core device of the latter, the engineering department is still in trial production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The works that failed have been piled up in the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the proposal of the Skyfire in the report mentioned by Itis, Roland is quite heart-warming. On a technical level, it is not difficult to transplant a 35mm sniper gun to a two-wing aircraft. Simply bury the entire gun body directly below the belly and cancel the shooter seat. If the number of bombs is controlled within ten rounds, it can be roughly balanced in terms of weight, and there is no need to change other places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that if you want to get a large-sized stone bullet, you must use the blood of the witch or the devil to ablate and separate the stone veins until you get the volume and shape. A moderate stone of punishment can be further processed. Big, the existing tools and lathes are almost helpless, small, and the stone will appear too brittle, and the process of screening the bottom material needs to consume a lot of magical blood, even if the witch alliance and the sleeping charm support his practice. That amount can not meet the needs of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To really solve this problem, you have to find a way out of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either figure out why they can process large stone pillars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either they are made with their blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If today’s fire has been able to return to the winter city from the front line in one day, and then supplemented with Aegis’s refrigerating capacity, deliver the fresh devil directly from the battlefield. Blood, it seems that it is not impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland silently put the proposal on the agenda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the night, he entered the dream world by convention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to speed up the project of the Graysburg Design Bureau, Roland has increased the number of dreams in the past month, which makes the original time lag behind the real world dreams. There are a lot of people who have been in the city in the late summer and early autumn. Now it is already floating in the snow, as if it is just a different area of ​​the same world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning of the village is still busy, the erosion and the catastrophe of the Prism City have not caused any impact on the residents, and the streets and the streets are still screaming. The breakfast paved, people rushed through here, and the snow that had accumulated in the night was covered with footprints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the nickname of the world is also facing a battle of gods, it is undoubtedly much more peaceful here than the battlefield of the wolf heart filled with red fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the long-term dream brings not only the seasonal alternation, but also the mentality of the devil's passerby has changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a period of surveillance and observation, Roland has basically confirmed that the devil who claimed to be Wakiris is not an aboriginal from the Kajid Peninsula. Although the registration data recovered by the martial arts association has been verified, there is indeed such a person in the delegation from the peninsula, but her behavior is difficult to explain with common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is no stranger to the fact that this identity is true and internal, but he himself is an example. Using "traversal" to describe each other is undoubtedly the most appropriate statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, Wakiris can still maintain camouflage, or try to act as an ordinary martial artist, such as looking through various books, can not speak Not talking, but as time went by, she gradually became irritable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially after the wound healed, she sneaked into the depths of the banned Prism City and stood in front of the erosion crack. According to Yan’s report, Wakiris’s face showed a clear anxious look, as if he was craving for something. She even thought that the other side had to jump into the erosion several times, but eventually she was patient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the move is to mourn the deceased partner, it is too far-fetched, because Wakiri has not stopped half a step in the place where the mission was killed - - She was rushing from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
