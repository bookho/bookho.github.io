			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland walked through the gates of several layers of guards and walked into the interior of the vault in the castle area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of Bianbu Town, all the golden dragons were added up and stuffed with a few boxes, and the basement of the castle was enough to hold the funds to keep the town running. Since the sale of steam engines and other magical creations, the income has risen steadily, and soon reached an astonishing level, which can not be overstated with the use of daily money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The site has become more expensive, and in order to facilitate the access of the Executive Office, he ordered a dedicated vault in the middle of the castle and the Executive Office. Although the rigor is strict, as long as the procedures are in line with the rules, the heads of various departments can enter the treasury to withdraw funds, which caused a hot discussion at that time. After all, almost all of the nobility who took out "their own family wealth" to build the territory was not, let alone allowed outsiders to enter and exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, apart from Barov’s knowledge, the rest did not know that Roland had not taken these hard-bones coins seriously, more or less. It doesn't matter, just keep up with the needs of the city. For a long time, the income of no winter is greater than the expenditure. He has not heard the report of the savings emergency for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty," Barov, who had been waiting in the warehouse, went forward. "Look... our golden dragon today, only the last ten Two boxes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the golden dragon in a box is about two thousand, and the total amount is 20,000, which is more than the past. The full warehouse, at first glance, seems to be somewhat empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the silver wolves and the copper eagle scattered in the corner, they piled up like a hill, but they couldn’t help much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long does it take?" asked Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the current trend...up to two months."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beyond my imagination "Also fast," he raised an eyebrow. "Is it mainly used for pay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this part accounts for more than 50% of the expenditure. - The population is growing too fast, and the expenditures of the engineering team and the smelting team are the most obvious. In addition, you hire a large number of seafarers from the Fjord Chamber of Commerce, and spend about four or five thousand gold dragons every month. Down, the Executive Office will be able to stick to the sales share of the next joint chamber of commerce -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing can stop the transport." Roland interrupted the boss if. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That..." Barov slammed his hand. "I remember when you said at the last meeting, there is a once-and-for-all solution... Really?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't forgotten it," Roland laughed, looking at the entire vault. Probably it was expected that there would be such a day, the treasury was quite spacious, and the windows were clear. After the iron railings and the shelves in the house were emptied, the basic and ordinary houses were no different, and they would not feel depressed for a long time. It is not bad for printing money. “When is the next pay?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A week later.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“These golden dragons Save it, don't move it for a while," he nodded. "You go to the office with me. I have a new department to build, and the specific regulations will be there."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this day came earlier than expected, he started preparing for this in the first half of the year. The tokens issued to the Witch Alliance and the Sleeping Curse are tests. If even the witch can't find loopholes and steal the banknotes, the basis for replacing the metal currency with banknotes is mature and ready for official use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty." Barov seemed to be relieved. He could see that he was really worried about the days when he had no money in the past. Now he has the approval of Roland. The wrinkles in the corners of the eyes are soothing a few points. "Yes, what is the name of the new department?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bank." Roland replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days later, the bulletin board of the Wintertown Central Square was replaced with a full version New notices and caused a great uproar among the residents. The Executive Office once again sent a special person to preach, which is a rare sight after universal education. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
