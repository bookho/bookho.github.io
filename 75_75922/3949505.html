			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Royal Highness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weird title...is like a word that will be heard in old stories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to turn her eyes and cast her gaze to her side, only to see a gray-haired man enter his own vision, and there were several women standing beside him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you feel?" he whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." She did not answer, but asked, "Where is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The Grey Fortress Kingdom West, Bianbu Town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good, things are moving in the direction she least wants to see, unknown location, unknown time Unknown person, she wants to roll out of bed, but finds that she can't make a little effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the four princes of the Greysburg Kingdom, the lord of Bentham Town, Roland Wimbledon," he said again. "These are all witches." Members, you...do you remember anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witches League? She frowned, they turned out to be witches? Although I don't know what this is an emerging organization, at least it is my own kind, but... Why do they look like the subordinates of this man? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, prince? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She recalled a little while, could not help but stunned, this is not the name of the secular regime in the first war of gods for more than four hundred years? Is it... I returned to the war before it started? Does the god give her a chance to come back again, let her prepare in advance to save the holy city and the people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, calm, she told herself that this unreasonable thing only happens in fictional pub stories. By the way, what did you end up with? In the basement of the lab building, a group of madmen rushed in. She released all the magic of the whole body and built it into the strongest ice barrier. Echo Magic Stone kept releasing the distress signal, waiting for them to return to the fertile plains, able to find themselves again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you saved me?" Yes, now that I have escaped from the ice barrier, it is only the witch army that is back! "Is the devil already retreating? Have we won? The Holy City... How is the holy city of Tacila?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This series of questions blurted out, she looked The faces of the other people changed and looked at each other, revealing a happy and excited look. A mature witch with a long red-brown hair couldn't help but ask, "We did find you in the basement of a stone pagoda. Are you really four hundred and fifty years ago?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrogator reminded her of the sacred warrior who was arrogant, and the hair of the man was like this, illuminating the heart like a flame. Compared with the gray-haired man, she is more willing to answer the question of the witch. Although she does not usually care about her identities, she is always offended by the inferior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed to the owner of the care, the man will be severely punished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My name is Ai Gesha, the witch of the Tacula Exploring Society," she paused. "What do you mean four hundred and fifty years ago?" Isn't it... you have been fighting the devil for more than four hundred years? This is impossible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have been sleeping for too long, things may come up with you. It’s a bit different.” The man who claimed to be Roland said, “If you feel that your body is not in the way, we can talk to you slowly.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Although the prince was very rude, she has no time to care about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the other party began to elaborate on the history of the Grey Fort and the evolution of the four kingdoms of the mainland, she felt a cold sweat on her back. In his remarks, Ai Gesha quickly found several corresponding signs - such as the fascinating forests, such as the desolate mountains... but put these signs into their own memories, and the conclusions made her shocking. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the place names match, the so-called four kingdoms are just the former wilderness - the narrow strip between the mountains and the sea, in their eyes A barren land with no development value. The wilderness area in his mouth turned out to be the fertile plain that he was familiar with. As for the holy city of Taqila, it has already become an unknown area, and it has been buried deep in the fertile plains with the long years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
