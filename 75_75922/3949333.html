			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days after the ashes left, Mai Hao unexpectedly returned to Bianbu Town and reappeared in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After asking the reasons, her return was warmly welcomed, and the Witch Alliance added another new member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What struck her was that the welcoming banquet was held in the back garden of the castle. The long iron shelves were covered with various meats and can be taken down at will. barbecue. Seasoning is also very rich, there are salt, oil, pepper, pepper, and Roland's personally prepared barbecue sauce - the mushroom produced in the fascinating forest and the whole chicken stew together, then add salt, sugar and wheat flour to stir, Can make up for the regrets without MSG. Mai Hao almost stopped eating his stomach before stopping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the afternoon, Roland tested her abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the nightingale, her total magical power is moderate in the witch, and her ability to behave can be changed into a variety of birds - provided she has seen it. When changing, the magic consumption is quite large, and it can be changed 4-5 times in a day. When it is in a state of deformation, it consumes very little magic. It is a summoning ability and is affected by the stone of punishment. The favorite bird is the pigeon, but Roland noticed that no matter what kind of bird she became, she would have a lot of body shape. For example, the sparrow, in his opinion, has the same size as a normal pigeon. As for being a pigeon, there is almost a sea eagle size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheat can't be turned into a fantasy flying beast, such as the Phoenix, Griffin and Kuang Peng drawn by Roland, which makes him feel sorry. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, there is something worth paying attention to in the plan of the ashes. What are the abilities of the many witches that Tilly has gathered? If there are auxiliary witches who can greatly improve the efficiency of farming, he does not mind using technology to exchange them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, Roland decided to write a long letter to Tilly, first explaining the natural allies on both sides, and then warning her that the church wanted to unify the mainland’s intentions. Finally, the olive branch was handed out, indicating the willingness to cooperate and cooperate with each other. When Mai Hao goes to the fjord next month, let her take it by the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the prince ushered in another good news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The factory for the production of steam engines was finally completed. The factory is located on the opposite bank of the Chishui River, close to the west end of the test field. The entire site has been fenced with wooden fences, and a simple road leading to the pontoon is also flattened. In Roland's plan, this place will be the industrial park after the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the need to expand the building space as much as possible, the factory is built from lighter weight wood and covers an area of ​​about 1,000 square meters. The machine tools made by Anna have been shipped in, respectively Two steam boring machines, two manual milling machines, a manual grinding machine and a manual lathe. Although these machines are simple in principle, the workmanship is first-class – except that the base or the pedal is made of wood, and the other parts are cut from wrought iron or steel. It can be said that at the level of existing materials, The highest precision machining is achieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers in the factory are only a pitiful ten-placer. They were originally blacksmiths and apprentices in the town’s blacksmith shop. They are now being used by Roland for fifty silver wolves. High salary is recruited here to learn how to operate high-end machine tools. Their iron tools and blacksmith shops have also moved to a brick house outside the factory. In addition to creating some unimportant parts, the steam engine will be produced entirely by machine tools. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland held a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the door of the factory. In order to strengthen his momentum, he recruited officials from the city hall and delivered a short speech. In the sound of the echo of the echo simulation, the Grey Fort Industrial Company was officially announced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, Roland, who is the company’s executive, ran to the factory when he was free, demonstrating the operation of the machine tool and the manufacture of the steam engine. Process. To let an illiterate blacksmith master how to process and assemble a steam engine, the best way he can think of is to solve the flow chart. Similar to the assembly instructions of the model, the part names, numbers, and dimensions are marked one by one, and then they are installed. The order and connection are depicted in the form of a graph. At this point, Soroya helped him a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few days of production, as he expected, almost none of the parts met the requirements, let alone spell out a complete steam engine. However, Roland does not care about the scrap rate. In the hands of Anna, these defective products can be recast into new plates in the blink of an eye. He believes that after repeated drills, it is sooner or later that these blacksmiths master the production methods of the new era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
