			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perro yawned and sat up from the bed, and the upper body immediately felt a chill. If he can, he hopes to stay in the bed, not only warm, but also Xue Lier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't sleep more?" The woman around turned over and snorted, "Is it still early?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned over and kissed each other's foreheads - Shirley's brown hair was soft and curly, the skin was as smooth as a baby, and a pair of cute big eyes . It was in the Long Opera House that she met her at the beginning. Almost one face, he was firmly attracted by these eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It should be almost noon, I have to go downstairs to see if there is any official business to deal with," Pedro whispered. "If you don't want to get up, continue." I am asleep, I will let the attendant send the lunch to the bedroom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I want you to accompany me," Shirley will arm Stretched over and grabbed his waist. "It’s snowing outside, there’s nothing to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is true, since After the evil moon came, the whole city suddenly quieted down, and the theater opened up once a week. The merchants in the market all evacuated and the pub closed the door. If you walk on the street during the day, you might even think it is an empty city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So...just sleep for a while? Pursuing Sherry's nearly a year, and now finally got his wish, Pei Luo is really reluctant to leave. The joy of one night yesterday made me exhausted, and now I am back to an energetic state. When I have had lunch, I may be able to linger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a knock on the door outside the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People, there is a blue letter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stunned, then Immediately turned over and got out of bed, picked up the robes that were thrown on the floor, and put them on his body. "I will come right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult?" Shirley Low Slamming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute," Pedro hurriedly fastened his belt and left the bedroom. After a while, he returned to the room and climbed into the bed again, with a letter in his hand with a blue cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this, who wrote it to you?" The woman was basically awake at this time, she yawned and sat up next to Pero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From Bentham Town," the latter responded. "It should be a personal letter from His Royal Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the cover and extracting the letterhead, he quickly swept through the contents of the letter, and his brow could not help but wrinkle. "His Royal Highness let me go to the town."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now?" Sherry was surprised. "Do you want to go this weather?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, probably what? "It’s a matter of concern." Pei Luo sighed. "I will be ready to go, and I will leave in the afternoon. Go home first, and I will find you when I come back." He couldn't help but think of it a year ago. I also took the wind and snow to the town of Bianque, and brought a warning to the Duke of Ryan to the long song fortress. Now, the reason for going to the barren land is because a letter from the town’s lord has to let Peirro sigh the impermanence of fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't you not see it?" She was a little displeased. "He even took a long song fortress, but you are the actual fortress." The executive, even the king’s order, does not have to be executed immediately?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s the Duke’s adult, it’s true, but Piro knows four The temper of the prince, he touched the other's head with a pet. "That's not the same, the king may not be able to control the West, but Lord Roland can... he is not only the lord of the town, but also the owner of the entire West." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After entering the evil month, the long song fortress does not have much official business to deal with, simply explain Some tasks were given to the men, and by the way, the father of Earl of Hermon was pulled to the castle to sit down, and Pedro left the castle. Different from the last time only one assistant followed, this time he was riding the Duke's exclusive "Lion Heart". The servants and apprentices brought more than ten people, plus two family knights, which can be called a huge momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a dozen people around the circle, it seems to be watching what, watching this group of people should be civilians, probably surrounded by the noise of neighboring households, occasionally popping out one or two sentences such as "Devil ""Hang her!" Such a sharp scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer said in his heart, said to the knight around him, "Go and see if they are ordinary disputes, let them roll back into the house."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers pushed the crowd out and walked to the middle to pull out the sword, everyone It quickly disappeared. He finally brought back a woman and two children, one of whom had a twine around her neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is going on?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult," women threw themselves in Pedro At the feet, "Hurry up to kill her! She has fallen into a witch!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This word makes Pei squint, "Witch?" He will The gaze moved to the other two, and the taller boy immediately stopped in front of the girl, making a fierce look that would come up at any time, but his face was blue and purple, apparently just being stunned, "She It’s not the devil’s minions at all. It’s played in the drama. The witch is also good and bad. Why do you deal with her?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you sure she is a witch? Pei did not pay attention to the boy and continued to ask the women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, you can't be deceived by the people in the theater. If the church is still there, you can't let them talk nonsense on the stage." The beast is also a little devil, I am punishing her for the church, adults, and strangle her, so that the atmosphere of hell will not spread to the long song city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Speak the point!" he scolded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After waiting for the other party to sneak through it, Pei Luo finally found out the cause and effect. After the church was burnt down by Felco, she and other believers spontaneously organized and continued to preach and pray in the outer city, waiting for the holy city of Hermes to re-send a new priest and build a western church. As for this situation, it is entirely coincidental that the girl used the ability to get rid of her when she was removing snow from the roof of the resident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the narrative, women repeatedly complained about the absurdity of the content taught in primary education, and the theater’s upside-down performances, making the nearby onlookers only dare to catch the boy. However, few people are willing to help to hang this wicked devil. Before changing, her body should have been hung under the roof of the house... These words of hatred have heard Peer’s eyebrows jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bring her back and have a good interrogation," he told the Cavaliers. "This time you stay in the fortress. When I come back, I want to see it." All believers who are related to her have been detained in prison."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What...no! Adults, how can you do this?" Women Before he finished, the protest was slap in the stomach by the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you really a witch?" Then Pei looked at the little girl who was horrified, "Show me a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter softly fell to the ground without any reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer shook his head and raised his voice to repeat it. "If you can prove that you are a real witch, I can let you go."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the girl sullenly put her hands into the snow, and soon, the thick snow of the palm gradually turned into a flowing ice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out," Peero nodded. "Follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Go?" The other person looked up. "Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A place suitable for witches to live." He signaled the servant to pick up the girl and continue to the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let her down, you liar! You promised to let her go!" The boy wanted to rush, but was stopped by several other servants, shouting The sound gradually disappeared behind the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
