			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please use slowly," the maid placed the wine on the square table, strangely I looked at the three people and said, "If you need to add wine, just pull the rope off the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know, let's go busy." Otto Waving his hand, the latter took a nap and turned away. As the door closed, the buzz of the lobby was blocked and the room was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, he still felt his heart pounding, his eyes staring at Andrea, for fear that she suddenly disappeared, "I thought this It was a dream. Belinda and Oro thought that you were dead. I didn't expect to see you again one day..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the market After shouting and yelling, the other person also turned his gaze to him - responding to the name proved that she did not just happen to be similar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it should be said that it must not be two people. Andrea’s voice looks so good, every move has a unique temperament, it is difficult to have other Women can compare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the reaction of the other party is not as pleasant as he expected, but the brow wrinkles, walks to his side, and lets himself follow her in the tone of command. Then hurried out of the market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably she didn’t want to cause too many people to watch. Yes, the nobility should not yell at the place where the civilians gather. It is too rude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two people walking into a single room in a pub, he will have the opportunity to look at each other again. For the past five years, she is still in memory. If this is a dream, he hopes to do it longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is your old lover?" The black-haired woman whistleed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you have to follow, you should know the value of silence at this time," Andrea gave her a look. "No one will talk." "You are dumb."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am trying to protect you," the other grinned. "Moreover, I started pulling me to buy Tilly’s birthday. Gifts, now I want to drive me away, too much to lose the noble style."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The noble style also has to look to whom," Andrea Tao, "It is not necessary for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Otto did not respond to seeing his own words, but he could not help but look awkward. To the same beautiful brunette woman, "Your friend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ember," waited for Andreia to speak, she said straightforwardly "Who are you, why do you know her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am Otto. Losey, from the morning kingdom," he heard the other person asking, he Feel Outside - the woman who claims to be ashamed is too straightforward and sharp. It seems that she is not a well-educated aristocrat. Why does Andrea stay with such a person? "I have known Andrea since I was a child, and my sister Belinda, Toro's Oro, and the eldest son of the morning lord, Anpein, we are friends who talk about everything."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like a bunch of powerful stories," Ashes shrugged. "Have you said that she is dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"That's because-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Enough," Andrea interrupted. "Belinda and Oro are not wrong." The Queen of Quin’s family you are familiar with is already dead.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But you are still here,” Otto shook his head again and again. What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning sun shines in the city, except for the royal family, the most prominent aristocrats are Tokat, Quinn and Losey, whose owners are It is the extremely trusted partner of the king and the minister of real power. This tradition has continued since the dawn of the morning, and it is still true for their generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them, Andrea is the eldest daughter of Quinn’s family, and both the appearance and the family are impeccable, and the number of pursuers is countless. No exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
