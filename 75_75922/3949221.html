			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The latest broadcast] Tomorrow is 515, the beginning of the anniversary, the most welfare day. In addition to the gift bag, this time the "515 red envelopes mad" must be seen, red envelopes do not grab the truth, set the alarm clock ~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; today this thing let Roland didn't bother to assemble the steam trampoline. For dinner, he deliberately prepared the chef to be extraordinarily rich, black pepper steak and omelet are not limited, eating Anna and lightning belly are supported. Nanawa tried to keep the etiquette, and finally the small mouth still chewed brightly. In addition to the restaurant, he also asked the maid to prepare the insulated porcelain, put it into the stewed pork and wheat porridge, and sent it to the nightingale room. As long as they wake up, they can eat warm food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used dinner, the next step is to arrange the room. Fortunately, the lord of the border town is very particular about the market, a town that was born for mining and early warning, and its castle is still built according to the standards of medium-sized towns. In the familiar words of Roland, it is a single-family villa with a living area of ​​900 square meters, a three-storey building with a tier, and a tower and an arrow tower at the four corners. A vestibule and a back garden are included. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland arranged the lightning room in Anna’s door, and next door was intended to be reserved for Wendy after rehabilitation. Seeing that Nanawa was wearing a candy-like belly and Anna entered the room, he could not help but shake his head with a funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the office, Roland poured himself a glass of ale. After all, the plan is not as fast as change. He thought that through the nightingale, he could harvest a large wave of witches, and light up the branches of chemical agriculture and other creatures in the technology tree. As a result, he did not expect the leaders of the co-help society to have such a big Hostility. Neutrals like nightingales and lightning are a minority. And Wendy... Listening to the lightning, she did not take the initiative to leave the Communist Youth League, just to save the nightingale, had to be carried by the snake magic Hakala attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two are two, he drank the wine in the cup, it is better than one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked the lightning about the power of her and Wendy when she was dining, knowing that the little girl could fly like a bird, flying freely in the air, Wendy could The power of the wind. These two abilities are of little use to Pantech, but if you use them well, you will still have much to do in the upcoming war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also inquired about the ability of other witches in the camp, and found that their abilities are diverse and completely irregular. Some effects can barely be explained by scientific theories, and some are completely unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the founder of the Co-Assistance Society, the snake magic Hakala, can make the magic condense into a serpentine--these snakes are not illusions, they can be touched, or Attack the enemy. Different snake patterns represent different toxins, and as far as lightning is concerned, there are at least two effects of paralysis and lethality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Roland found that Anna or Hakala, the magic of the witches mostly only produced at close range, such as Anna’s green fire, five meters away. Will suddenly disappear. Hakala's viper can't leave the body too far. Nightingale and lightning have a shorter range of abilities, and when they want to affect foreign objects, they must be contacted to take effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when they faced the church army equipped with the stone of bows and punishments, they only fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, the fire in the fireplace gradually darkened. Roland sneezed and planned to go back to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the bedroom door, he found something wrong - the scene in front of him was familiar, a woman sat on her bed, half of her figure was covered In the darkness, the fire reflected her back on the wall like a mural. But there are many differences. She did not wear the robes that were unchanged, but instead changed into ordinary casual clothes. Her appearance is no longer a strange look at first sight, but familiarity can be seen at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was a little nervous, this battle, is it... your good fortune is coming? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale also saw the prince, she got up and walked slowly. Just resting for a long time, her face was much better than when she first saw it. The rosy sides of her cheeks replaced pale, and her hair was no longer dull. It must be said that the witch's self-recovery ability is indeed amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have worked hard," Roland coughed and broke the silence. "Why don't you take a break, lightning has told me everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
