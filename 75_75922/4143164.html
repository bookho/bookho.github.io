			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guard put the handle into the nose, forced a few turns, then slammed the valve, and the violent tremor suddenly spread from the nose to the machine. tail. In this tremor, the engine made a series of squeaks that drove the propeller to run quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the roar became a constant hum, Gude slowly pushed the throttle stick according to the manual requirements, and the plane seemed to be pulled by the general The runway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow..." there was a burst of exclamation in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really works! Goode is also greatly encouraged. It is listening to his own command and he is driving this big guy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but look at the princess sitting on the left side of the wing, and saw the gray hair of the other side fluttering in the wind, with a smile in his eyes. Princess... Is this complimenting him? Goode's confidence is a little more, and then just follow the instructions of the other party, flying up should be no problem! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, after ten days of interest, there were still no hints on the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode looked at Tilly frequently, but it was always the expression of laughter and laughter - when the plane crossed the center line of the runway, he suddenly realized One fact: I won't get any instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But considering that you are the first to go to heaven, I will fly as a mentor near the driver's seat, step by step to remind you how to do it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence does not include him. The Princess is caring for ordinary students, not against the regulations and making mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the other students failed, the next time, he only had one chance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancients felt cold in their hands and feet, and yesterday’s loss and remorse came back to their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is undoubtedly the best performance that allows me to say nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He Vaguely guessed the idea of ​​His Royal Highness - if you can't fly by your own ability, if you can't get the best results, then the college will not leave him. This is the price of making mistakes. Only by showing enough talent can he have the value to stay here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but can you really let the plane fly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one third of the runway at the end, and at the end is a meadow, and further away is the flight fence - if it hits straight, only I am afraid that Miss Nanava can do nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No...it’s too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode subconsciously wants to pull the throttle stick, which seems to be the only way to save lives, reduce the speed and avoid frontal impact - face avoidance When avoiding high walls, this is almost a human instinct choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next moment, he felt a hand on his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you like flying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel's voice is like an ear side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flight-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, if it’s a bird, there’s still a way out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is to fly up and cross the barrier from the top of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing left now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems as if for a long time, it seems that after a long time, Goode’s hand gripping the pole has been re-moved – but not recycled, but Push on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nose suddenly made a roaring roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall is like a face-to-face collision! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faster, faster! Goode's eyes widened, staring at the wall that was getting closer and closer, and the body was even ready to meet the impact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that moment did not come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plane almost passed over the wall and rushed to the sky. When the obstacles in front of the eyes disappeared completely, a scene that had never been seen appeared in the eyes of Goode. The outline of the college, the shape of the coast, and the distant winter city are all reflected in the field of vision, and as his movements rotate, the morning breeze blows up to fill the last vacancy in his feelings, day after day. The practice also found the benchmark at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This free experience made him want to shout out loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human being able to fly is really great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the plane landed, Goode fell to the front of the Princess Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for giving me this opportunity, you let me see the sight that I only saw in my dreams."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the nearly half-hour test flight, he basically completed several standard movements such as pull-up and hovering in the manual. Although the process was awkward, it was finally done one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the final score, you can only listen to your fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he still does not meet the requirements of the other party, but at least left an unforgettable memory, as long as you close your eyes, the world will suddenly expand a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you join the Air Knight Academy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly's voice from the top of the head It came from above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gude hesitated, and finally decided to tell the truth, "Go back to the temple, at the beginning to earn more rewards, and later want to get ahead, now ...the flight itself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can give you whatever the fee, reputation, or flight - as long as you can kill enough devils "The princess's statement is not fluctuating, just like the ice." Fighting for the Grey Fort, driving the plane to kill every demon appearing in the field of vision, using their blood in exchange for everything, this is the duty of the empty knight. It is also the purpose of the establishment of the college. If you can do it, go to the eagle to recover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gude excitedly raised his head, "His Royal Highness, What you mean is --"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are qualified." Tilly walked back to the line without returning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until 5:00 pm, the first round of test flight came to an end. Two of the sixteen were eliminated, but fortunately they all survived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finkin and Heinz passed the assessment after Goodyear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dissolution, the two grabbed Goode and dragged him to the sidelines. "Are you crazy? Your Highness Terry said that if he succeeds in flying, Passing the customs, you are good, began to hesitate not to speed up, almost hit the wall, but also flew out of the college area, turned around the sea, not afraid to fall into the sea and drown?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an accident, and Goode rolled his eyes. "Isn’t the predecessor before taking off, isn’t it all for everyone to do their best and go all out? I know that as long as I finish pulling and falling, I’m qualified, just thinking. The scores of several actions are always higher than one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's good luck." Finchem shook his head helplessly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't care," he grinned. "Without pointing, the takeoff is so decisive."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey? What is the point of no guidance, isn’t your Highness telling you the timing of the drawbar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s better than other There are fewer people," Heinz agreed. "After all, we all made a mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
