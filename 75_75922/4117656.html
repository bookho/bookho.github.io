			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other directions? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the state of spiritual resonance, the communication process between the two is simplified, and Andrea can get an answer right away with a question - even Say, it’s not Sylvie that answers her, but herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting rid of the initial discomfort, the rest is free and enjoyable - she already likes this feeling, whether it’s a sight or a sight Blending with Sylvie's consciousness has made her perceptions broader, as if she is living with the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not know how it feels to resonate with Your Royal Highness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flight group communication, here is lightning. Ark group, can you see me?" At this time, another pair of hearings printed lightning the sound of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia converged the spirit and pulled back the vision. "Found you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “How is this height?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “There should be no problem, just look for the clouds to hide.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the entire sniper battle, lightning and McMillan will serve as the final remedy. Once they fail to achieve effective killing, or if the number of enemies exceeds expectations, they will swoop down from the enemy's head and complete the final blow at close range. When the little girl swoops at full speed, the speed is almost three times that of the beast, and with the unexpected transformation of the wheat, the success rate is almost 100%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this trick can only be used once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are other devils on the field, they can only choose to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Andrea did not consider letting them take the shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has enough confidence in her abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of hundred, this is her pride as a shooter, but also to overwhelm the ash of the ash by one's own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants these little girls to see what is called a real profession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six kilometers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi’s voice rang again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, I am aiming at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia closed his eyes and completely disappeared his vision, then placed his attention on the first goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five kilometers is not the limit on the range, nor the limit of ability, but her personal limit - in theory, as long as the bullet is within the scope of the bullet, see It can hit, but the upper limit of magic restricts her play, so that she can't really achieve this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the magic is exhausted at one time, the witch will fall into fainting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five kilometers can be said to be the optimal solution from repeated tests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the drive of ideas, the magic of the body rushed out, wrapping her whole person, the fictional guide line appeared soon, and was undetected The beasts are connected together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to be associated with the bullet’s trajectory by looking at this silver-like thin line—it’s really exaggerated, it’s like an arch bridge. Rising high, pointing straight to the empty sky, and then as the distance grows into a undulating line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had asked Roland down, and her answer was somewhat unexpected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that this ability is not an aim at all, because the aim can not measure what has happened, but has not yet arrived. After the bullets are out, the speed will continue to drop, and will be affected by the external environment. For example, a pair of cross winds can deviate from the drop point of hundreds of meters, so the precise sight can not make the shooter do To the hundred and hundred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After being extended to five kilometers, Baifayizhong became a luxury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is my ability?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I guess the coin." The other party seems to have been waiting for her to ask, although she is suspected of some pretense, but she does not hate it, "if the external conditions It’s exactly the same, then the result will be fixed. Think about it, as long as you shoot, then the bullet will definitely fall somewhere, so how can you let it fall on the enemy’s head? It’s like throwing it up in the sky. A coin, but you can pick the one that stands up in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are sure? But I can’t always touch myself when I play cards. The card you want..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, these two are not the same thing. In short, do you want to be stronger? There is a discipline maybe It is possible to greatly increase your ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really? What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;陛下笑笑笑,“Probability Theory.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the conditional probability is to analyze the combined effects of different conditions on the outcome, and your ability is These conditions become constant, or simply erase them. This ability has unlimited potential, as long as you can master it completely - until now, Andrea still clearly remembers the smile and handed the book to her. scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she was also very uplifted at the time, as if a supreme and smooth road was slowly unfolding in front of her, over the extraordinary is now! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this feeling only lasted until the evening, after she opened the book Probability Theory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not something that normal people can understand! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咔""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the moment when the silver line is integrated into the world background, Ander Lia buckled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roar of the rifle far more than a hammer almost slammed into her chest, the flames flashed, and the impact of the airflow was a huge impact. . The butt can not be restrained back, but then hit the shoulder, but the multi-channel flexible cushion coating specially designed by the tail helps her to remove most of the force, and the gun frame with the cushion back further spreads the impact to the whole body. Not ready for the dust to land, she is ready for the second shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strange magic then flooded into Andrea's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is arranged as a drill, except for the witches and Maggies necessary to attack the sniper, others can provide her with magic to complete the shooting and protect The responsible witch is no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, hit?" The crowd asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, this blow will determine the success or failure of this mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The bullet will fly for a while," Andrea replied confidently. "But it has already hit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, as you said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has selected the inevitable lucky coin among ten million coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if Sylvie catches the bullet, she can still silently tell its life - after four kilometers, the height of the warhead is already lower The height of the devil's flight, although its speed still has terrible lethality, the head has deviated too much, and as it goes on, it will only plunge into the mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
