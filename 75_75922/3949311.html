			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain outside the window has basically stopped, and the clouds are dyed red by the sun that is about to fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pushed the door of the first floor room, Margaret walked around in front of the fireplace, and looked quite uneasy. After seeing the prince, Shaun, who was on the sidelines, saw her hand and left, and she hurried forward and hurriedly asked, "His Royal Highness, how is lightning?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned, he envisioned each other's reactions, from calm to anger to indifference, but did not expect her first sentence to be this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She's fine...just tired."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? That's good. "She looked like she was relieved." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You seem to care about her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She looks like her father. Especially her narrow eyes and pointed nose... I can see that she is the daughter of Thunder."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she sighs With a sigh of relief, unbutton the neckline, lower his head, and take off a string of gold ornaments hanging from his neck. "Is the verification you said before...Is it judged by the ability of the witch? If this proves mine If you are sincere, can you let her join this conversation? I don't like the feeling of being secretly peeped."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pendant is made up of a chain of gold chains It is made up of a large, light blue gemstone—the jewel that has been cut into a hexahedron, which should be a high-quality stone of punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is thinking about how to open up to reduce the other party’s resentment and doubts. I did not expect her to take the initiative. To be honest, he was somewhat admired by the fjord woman, and despite the extremely unfavorable situation, she was still trying to grasp the initiative of the dialogue. Whether it is negotiation skills or acting style, she is in line with the identity of a successful businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the stone of the gods handed down from the other side and hung it on the hanger by the fireplace - this quality of the stone of punishment is estimated to be about one meter The magic range is comparable to a huge black hole in the nightingale. Maybe in order to avoid the effect of the stone, she has already escaped far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's talk to the living room," Roland said. Since the other party shows sincerity, he should not be too stingy. When the two entered the living room, the nightingale had already appeared in the main position, holding his chin with his hands, deliberately posing for a long time - it seems that her thoughts are the same as her own, the prince thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking the seat, he first introduced: "This woman is called the nightingale, she can judge the authenticity of your speech."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Miss Nightingale." Margaret nodded to her, and the latter also returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said before, you are not malicious to the witch, why?" Roland raised the first question, which is the question he most wants to know, "as far as I know." There is also a church power in the fjord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But its influence is far less than that of the Three Gods, or that most of the fjords’ beliefs and sand people Similar, worship the sky, the ocean and the earth. As for me..." She paused. "I once had a very good partner. On the way to a sea fishing, we encountered a storm, and the sailboat was interrupted by huge waves. She became a witch in this disaster and could breathe like a fish. She found me who lost her consciousness and dragged me to the shore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Later?" The nightingale was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After I woke up, she left...maybe she was more eager to be in the sea* than with me," Margaret Sorry to say, "I have never seen her since. The people in the village often say that she will appear when the fog rises in the sea, and use the song to guide the fishing boat to avoid the reef. In any case, my partner can not It’s the evil, not the devil's minions.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded, the witches were awakened by ordinary people, if they were awakened before They have a deep contact or understanding, and the impression they form is hard to change by the unilateral rhetoric of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You seem to have a good understanding of the witch's ability? I guess in one sentence that I may have more than one witch here."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
