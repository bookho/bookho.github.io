Nanawa turned her head back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy walked out from behind the curtain, smiled and licked her head. "You have made a decision. Can you ask me not too late now?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because I don't know if it's good or bad," she muttered. "I'm not as clever as Anna's, what to do." "Everything is full of confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can be like her, there are not many people." Wendy softly said, "So you choose not to regret it." The answer is just fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the little girl's thoughtful look, she couldn't help but feel a little emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that the first time I saw Nana Va, the other party was still a naive gimmick, and saw the birds going up and saying the last two sentences, seeing the blood Fainted, don't talk about thinking for others, even your own problems are not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just over four years, she has learned to stand on the perspective of others and has her own subjective judgments. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, not only her, lightning, Luo Jia, Lily, and even the mystery month, have changed significantly compared to before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether their choices are correct, at least they dare to make choices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is probably the character of the younger generation...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty slightly smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And myself...there is no such courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabbah walked all the way to the theater - she didn't need road signs The guideline, the lights and the vocals under the night are the best signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her pace is getting faster and faster, and she gradually turns from walking to running. I don’t know why, she feels that her body is as light as it is, and the past has never been like In this way, I can't wait to get back to the first army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mobilized her magic and gave herself a small order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Find the Tat in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is done to find the team as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the survivors she identified were the only ones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body passes through the crowd as fast as a cat, eyes constantly capture the surrounding scene, and correspond to the memory in the mind, after a quarter of an hour, Kabbah looks Got a familiar figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, the other party also noticed her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"裘""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great, you are fine!" Didn't wait for her reaction Come over, Tatsu has already hugged her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabbah suddenly became a stalemate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s changed to normal, she’s already shunned and said, and she will take a slap in the face, but she’s more excited than herself. Tatsu, her raised hand finally failed to take. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, only maintained the number of interest, Trent will react. He panicked and lost his hand, stuttering, "Hold, sorry... ...I forgot that you are...that, I am just too happy, and nothing else, anything else..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabbah noticed that there is still Two familiar faces are also coming towards this side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the survivors in the clock tower are not the only two of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are in Iron Sands, your thin and light goddess' behavior is enough to be dragged out to feed the sand." She said in the other's ear, "But I am not a goddess now, but a Saudi soldier. Do you understand? Do something in the play, don't let others see the flaws, otherwise, I will not spare you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I, I understand ..." Tatsu did not dare to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, don't forget this. By the way, if I pull you first, then it is your honor, naturally you don't have to feed the sand. "Oh," Kabbah paused. "Now, celebrate with other teammates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's great to be discharged so quickly! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does the injury on your arm not matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people who have been surrounded Come over, everyone embraces each other and shares the joy of survival. On the set-up stage, the drama is nearing the end, and the rain-like applause is connected. No one has noticed this little episode in the Nine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the first commander of the first army, the iron axe, boarded the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his opening, the crowd quickly quieted down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that in the past eight days, you have experienced a hellish test. There has never been a war before, and it will be harsh to this point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because it is not for territorial, power and wealth, the devil has only one purpose, that is, to destroy us, except that they do not need Any compensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the enemy will not care that we will not surrender, nor will we care about our own wear and tear, even if their casualties are far greater than ours. Will not stop the attack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even so, you still resist the present and survive this hell test, which is enough to explain, The devils who do their best are powerful, but they are limited—they are not as invincible as the legends describe! The eight-day test can be said to be no less meaningful than the Battle of Takira!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where we defeated a devil army In the wolf heart, we are faced with six or seven devils! The enemy is coming out of the nest. From the west mountain to the east bank, they can be seen everywhere! But until now, we have not been eliminated!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a stir in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe paused a bit and then raised the tone. "Yes, in order to avoid its edge, I ordered the temporary withdrawal of Jinshiling and Fengshaobao." The same may be true for the fine sand city and the sinking pool, but this is not a failure, but an opportunity to launch a counterattack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know what you are worried about, but Don't forget what I said before—this war has nothing to do with territory and wealth. It is the only purpose to destroy the opponent. We are only giving away cold and cold stones and empty houses, but the devil has paid tens of thousands. The casualties!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the key to winning the war. As long as the strength of the First Army is still there, it is only a matter of time to recapture these cities! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The war will sooner or later spread to the Cage Mountain area, and it will become a battlefield, but before that, enjoy this night!" Relaxation is to meet the stronger challenges. After the test of hell, we must be repaid in hell! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long live the gray castle, long live Roland, long live! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the iron axe shouted the end of the sentence, the camp began to boil.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Everyone repeats the same slogan, and the doubts and worries in the bottom of my heart are also disintegrated.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, an inspiring piece of music sounds <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Echo step by step to the stage to mark the final ending of the drama.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the melody of the song, Kabbah seems to have seen the scene of the army sweeping through the devil's position.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
