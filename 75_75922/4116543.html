			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into 0827, Garcia seems to have just taken a bath, the sportswear used for morning exercises has been replaced with a set of red and white martial arts gowns, and can still be seen on the cheeks. The rosy that has been soaked in hot water; the excellent appearance of the Wimbledon family and the gray hair of a wet shawl seem to make people feel bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want something to drink?" She shook the cup in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the first time I went to her house, there was a kind of indifference on her face that refused to be thousands of miles away... Of course, there is no soft now. Where to go is. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; ". No, thanks," Roland curiosity, "you have a game today?" <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; “Which athlete you have seen is changing clothes at home? Pre-match insulation is one of the most important preparations for the players.” Garcia poured herself a glass of milk and sat down opposite him. “A shabby movement. The pavilion, the locker room is always necessary - sometimes I really doubt whether your common sense is "eroded" to swallow. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha..." Roland covered it with a sly laughter. "I thought the martial arts would be special." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In the eyes of the public, it is no different from other sports, but the process is more exciting and the bonuses are more generous. She shrugged. "The reason I wear this trial gown is because I need to use the influence of the martial arts." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Shoot an ad? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" is going to protest! "Jiacia didn't have a good air. "You don't read the newspaper?" The Sanye Group is about to dismantle the wall of the North Street. If we don't stop it, the next goal of the group will be the package, and your home will become ruin by then. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃...he almost forgot to have this thing, "That... I wish you all the best." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You-! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a newcomer who has never played a game, has zero popularity, and even has no trial robes," Roland said with a regrettable expression. "Even if you go, it will not work." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things are understood by people!" Garcia took a list from the coffee table and photographed him. "Look at the people above, how many are martial arts?" They are all residents of the bottom of the building, but still willing to protest with me! If you choose not to speak because you are not famous, then everyone will ignore our existence! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the stubborn Garcia, Roland can't help but be touched, whether it is facing the erosion of the outside world, or ordinary life, this seemingly indifferent The woman’s heart is actually more enthusiastic than most people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does she have a place to live? Of course not, the background of the big family, the star martial arts, the nature The master of power, no matter what, can make it easy for her to buy a house in the city center. What she did is not for herself, but for other residents in this old community - most of them All ordinary people, with a modest salary every month, can enjoy the benefits brought by the surrounding developed facilities. Once they are moved to a new area in the suburbs, the quality of life will undoubtedly drop several grades.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he knows that these are the illusions associated with the dream world, the residents in the cabinet building are all defeated by Jieluo, but as the world changes to the unknown, he also Not sure if your initial thoughts are correct The indistinguishable illusion is in no way different from the facts. For example, it is difficult for him to regard the radiant woman in front of her as an illusory empty shell. The longer she stays in her dreams, the more she feels. Strong.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a book that has been brought back, it is considered a thank you, it is no problem to go shopping with her.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland is ready to agree, a familiar name on the list suddenly comes into his eyes -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Barorotsheim "." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the name that is unique to the Devil's Residency at 0510. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
