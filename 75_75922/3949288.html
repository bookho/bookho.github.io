			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The injured soldier quickly got a cure for Nana Va, and the fracture of the joint was very handy for her. After Roland let the first army return to the camp, there were only the chief knight, the witch and several guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gloomy face, walked to the side of the body, and directed Carter to cut the bullet in the back of the opponent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood hole is about one finger and a half deep. After the incision, the lead pill has been broken, and the trauma is basically the same as that of ordinary people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think?" He asked Carter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter also seems a little annoyed, probably did not expect to let a person who has never received sword training to shake a move, "empty power and speed If you don't want to see what he can do, the first shot will cut his head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the other party is a knight "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Carter thought for a moment. "If it was the kind of knight under the Duke, I would probably be able to cope, but change to king. I am unable to parry the Hurricane Knight or the Steel Knight of the Knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is undecided, everyone is due to skill and swordsmanship, Carter said perhaps That's right, but with the equipment, the situation will turn sharply. Suppose the prisoner is wearing heavy armor, armed with an iron helmet, and with a huge sword in his hands, he can't easily win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of powerful power is multifaceted - it can carry thicker armor and weapons, can burst faster, and can last longer Combat. Roland feels that he has to correct the idea of ​​a long song fortress, adrenaline? No, this stuff is much more terrible than adrenaline. The hormones stimulate the body's potential at most, and the red pill has clearly made the prisoner break through its limits. In particular, the speed and momentum that he showed when he ran was almost comparable to that of heavy cavalry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black pill is equally astonishing, and the slashing of the ribs and the close-range shots can't stop him. If it is an ordinary person, it has long lost its fighting power because of pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange force without fear of violence is already so powerful, if it is a group of well-trained soldiers? Thinking of what the high priest said, Roland couldn't help but frown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness," said the nightingale, "You look at his skin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoner's hand After the epidermis faded from the original red color, it turned gray and there were a lot of wrinkles, like snakes that were molting. Roland poked with a hilt and found that the skin was no longer a solid muscle, but an empty touch. After the incision, it was found that the subcutaneous fat was completely mucoid, and the muscles also shrank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This phenomenon is the same as after the swallowing of the stone of God's punishment," she looked at the prince. "The pill really contains the ingredients of the stone."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ability to swallow stones does not produce the effect of increasing strength," Roland thought. "How did they make such unscientific things?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pill seems to have strong side effects, and it is not clear whether it is permanent or recoverable. Roland is more inclined to the former. If it is the latter, this kind of medicine similar to the enhanced version of morphine and adrenaline is a war medicine. It is not surprising that the church uses it to dominate the world according to the recovery time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it lasts for a short time and has side effects, it is enough to be vigilant, Roland thinks. If the church turns to support Tefco or Garcia, it will be possible to face a drug-sending army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes him even more uneasy is that the church is willing to take this kind of thing out for sale. After considering the unification of the Grey Fort, the new king used the pill to bite them. ? The grey cannon can recruit more cannon fodder on the battlefield than the old and new holy city. If it is consumed, the trial army will only be consumed a little bit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless...they have stronger cards in their hands, they don’t care what happens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland thought of a sigh here, he originally intended to solve the problem of the town’s population and insufficient funds by attacking the long-song fortress, and then focusing on education, production and agriculture. Strive to expand Bianbu Town into a city in a short period of time, as for weapons research to temporarily put aside. But now it seems that the construction of the army can not be put down, the first army must expand the number of people, the guns will continue to be produced, and the new weapons research must be listed as early as possible - for example, the two guns and the fixed bullets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
