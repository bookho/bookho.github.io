			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a scream in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The army is almost always selected among the formal residents, and the conditions are getting stricter, open recruitment to everyone, or the battle during the war, how suddenly today Open? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is a new migration of Gu Gude, I heard that the uncle mentioned how good the military treatment is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you join the First Army, you will have no worries in this life, not only eating and wearing all-inclusive, even if you can get a pension after death, the family will also get Benefit. And they eat more than just porridge pancakes, fish fillets, dried meat and butter are common things, and not limited! In addition to the possibility of ruining life, it is almost a perfect job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it is the perfect job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can change so much, how much is your life worth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode has been in exile from the wolf heart to the Grey Fort, and has seen too many sufferings and disasters. A group of people fell on the side of the road like a beast, and the crow danced happily on it, enjoying the feast... Sometimes life is not much better than grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, the Hermes Church, which swept the majority of the wolf-hearted kingdom, lost in front of the King of the Grey Fortress and joined this mighty and mysterious army. It may be safer than when the knight is a slave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also good to join the Second Army. Although all the conditions are almost the same, it may be sent to other cities, but the security level is higher, basically not listening. Said that there is a loss of news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, if you can be selected by the military, no matter which team you are assigned to, you can be regarded as the best way for outsiders like them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode and Mango are excited, they look at Bagi together, "Uncle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The latter also seems a little hesitant, meditation after a moment of pain and laughter, "I still do not go ... In order to hire me, the foreman must have thought a lot, I can not destroy this agreement."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now it’s just for registration. It’s not necessarily possible," Shanguo advised. "You can wait until the results come out and make a decision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At that time I was afraid that I would not be determined to refuse," Bagi shook his head. "Let's go, I will wait for your good news in the square."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shanguo still wants to say something, but Gudra lived on the shoulder, "starting to line up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked back and forth, and finally nodded. "Then let's apply first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because many of the applicants are illiterate, the scene Looks like Confusion, After registering the name, he was taken to the side of the black guards, separated by the crowd. At the same time, more and more people should be recruited by the news. Seeing that the corner of the square was surrounded, the commentator had to close the registration channel and loudly told him that he would continue to recruit. Even so, everyone has not dispersed for a long time, many people stop around the tent, seems to want to see what is the assessment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made Gour unfortunately fortunate, but fortunately it didn’t come too late today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the registered side, someone has gotten into the tent under the guidance of the guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed that this tent is close to a hundred steps and is wide enough to accommodate all applicants, but no more than ten people can enter at a time, which means Assessment may be more complicated and difficult than imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure enough, it didn’t take long for the screams of screams in the awnings, which made the applicants waiting outside look awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Shanguo shrunk his neck. "Isn't it the ability to test beating?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is tortured, the screams should be a period of time," Goode said, "such a coherent cry, it seems like a shock."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of my lack of experience in swearing and jealousy, he sighed with relief. "I also heard from others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, There was another vomiting sound in the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faces of everyone are a little blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this test again?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Goode dumb . Can guess that there are ghosts! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first batch of assessors was brought out, his heart could not help but jump, only one of the ten people stayed inside, which means that the elimination rate was as high as nine. to make? And why are their steps so weak? It's like standing in an unstable position - at least in terms of body shape, the strength of these people should not be too bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has no time to think about why. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard called his name, "Goode!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Goode Pinch the fist and strode into the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space inside is not large, it seems to be divided into multiple areas by the curtain. In the order of entry, the group sat down in front of a man in military uniform - but the stool was a bit strange, it needed to be tiptoe to sit up, and it was very easy to shake, it was like deliberately uncomfortable. To his slightest peace of mind, Shan Guo is also in this team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the appraiser of the project," the military man said. "You don't need to know my name because most people will soon be eliminated." Even if you pass all the assessments, you are just taking the first step. If you really want to join the army, you still have a lot to learn!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this Is it in the selection of the Second Army... or is it a new reserve army than the Second Army? Goode thought, but no matter what, as long as the salary can make him and Rachel better, he has to try anyway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now I am announcing the rules," the other party continued. "Everyone puts their feet on the pedals for five minutes, no matter what you see, don't Falling down from the stool. Of course, landing on the feet is a failure, so get ready to start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't help but face each other, "It's that simple?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer sneered aloud, did not answer, but pulled the curtain around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a strange white light swallowed Goode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came back to God, he found himself floating in the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ah——————————————”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ear There was a scream of screams at the side of the river, and there was a dull slamming sound. This caused a lot of confusion, and even Goode also subconsciously wanted to flutter his hands and feet, trying to escape the ending of the broken bones, but the slight swaying touch under his body made him wake up instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is still sitting on the stool! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However more terrible is still behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating doesn’t last long, and soon the clouds around it start to rise, which means he’s falling – the feeling of falling to the ground is almost indescribable. Goode felt a heart almost rushed to the eyes of the blind! The brain issued an extremely dangerous warning, but sensible but told him that he still had an invisible bench under his ass! Under the impact of two contradictory thoughts, it was Rachel’s face that was finally presented in his mind...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the white light dissipated, the scene in the tent returned to his sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the officer clap his hands. "You passed the first assessment, and the scores are much better than the previous one. But there are still Several tests, I hope you can stick to the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
