			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people in the police department are rushing, conveying the command and reporting of the case, and the red moon has become the hottest topic in these days, and the whole The organization has become a pot of porridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the new king of the Grey Fort, Roland’s royal residence, even if there is such a little wind in the city, the police department has to find out the reasons and record In the book, let alone the big events of fire and explosion at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter Lannis had not had a close eye for two days and two nights. After he had comforted his frightened wife that day, he devoted himself to his work. Protecting the safety of your majesty is always the first priority of the chief knight, and he will not tolerate people chaos here. According to past experience, accidents at multiple locations at the same time must be committed by the gang. Therefore, he first invited the Winter Detective Corps to assist the police department in conducting investigations. Carter believes that as soon as he traces it down, he will soon be able to bring the instigators to justice. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a large number of reports were handed in, a joint investigation team consisting of the Witch Alliance, the Kingdom Security Bureau, and the Executive Department Police Department was formed. It is not placed on accidents or crimes that occur in the city, but the new magic shadow is the main investigation content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults, witnesses have already been brought," a knight attached to the ear canal, "Do you want to start asking?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter put aside the distracting thoughts, and drank the cup of tea in the cup and nodded. "Begin, let other people come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is not a trial inmate, in order to take into account the other party's emotions, the inquiry is conducted in an office that is temporarily vacated. In addition to him, the main members of the joint investigation team are Ms. Ai Gesha and Deputy Director of the Security Bureau, Vader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first witness to be brought into the house was a maid of a hotel, 21 years old, an informal resident, and no criminal record. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks a little nervous, sitting on the chair and squatting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter swept his hand in the information, and asked in a deep voice, "Miss Linglong, right? I am very curious, the fare of the premiere of "The Destroyed Dust" Up to fifty golden dragons, where did you get such a huge sum?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, this is not something I stole or grabbed! The other party quickly argued, "Mr. Victor, who I take care of, is worth a lot of money. He paid for me. Many people in the administrative hall on the day of buying the tickets noticed that I swear not to lie!"<br />< In fact, in these preliminary investigations, he has already sent people to touch the bottom. The first question is to increase the invisible pressure, so that the other party can't easily talk nonsense. After all, Miss Nightingale is not here. "Is Victor? Are we going to find him later? Now let's talk about what you saw at the end of the film."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes..." The voice of the maid trembled a little. "At the time, I didn't quite understand what happened, just as the hallucinations became real..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, she stopped to state her statement, "Fortunately, the last chase is repelled by the police, otherwise I can't imagine the two people's end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Carter frowned, and he also saw the Shadow, "Wolf" is thrilling, but it is not exaggerated to this extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure that the weapon of the pursuer has injured the audience?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...no Ok, but Mr. Victor’s face is indeed bleeding, and the screams of other injured people are not disguised..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Remember when this change happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"About ten minutes before the end? Or longer... sorry, I was so scared at the time, almost I have been hiding in the arms of Mr. Victor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you have anything to ask?" Carter looked at the other two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the photo, it is the actor of the Star Flower Troupe, who plays the Guardian of the Witch in the play. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it is him, I remember very clearly, he also thanked us at the time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Carter can't help but get a goose bump. He naturally knows that once the film is finished, it can't be changed. As for the self-talking, it is impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the two are no longer open, he waved his hand to the lower part, "For another person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The following witnesses are also very similar. In simple terms, everything in the shadow seems to be alive, although it was confirmed to be a false alarm afterwards, but it was actually happening at the time. The mutual application of testimony means that this is not the result of personal illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Carter’s attention was on fire and explosion a few days ago, the report about the panic in the theater was not too high, and now he is faint Understand why the above will be more concerned about this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next witness was the policeman who was standing in the courtyard and was responsible for maintaining order, the captain of the second team."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain obviously has to calm down and quickly explain the process of the matter, "I First, I heard the crying and cry for help from outside. When I was going out to find out, I noticed that I didn’t know when there was a red moon in the sky. To be honest, I was a little hesitant, I don’t know if it was a good post. At that time, a witch ran out from the back door of the movie room, and she asked me to immediately enter the room with my men to protect all the audience."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then you fired back the chasing in the shadows?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it sounds weird, it is Well, they are maybe actors, but they have already caused a real threat to the audience. Plus I always think these are just hallucinations, so There is hesitation "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; penultimate questioning, it is time to play the specter of witches, sunset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What can I do, I am also desperate. I used to activate the time stamp who is the one who has the magic and the job, who knows that this problem will occur." "She blamed it as soon as she entered the door." At that time, it was well placed, and suddenly the seal printed me out of the horizon. According to the unexpected situation, I should stop the magic input immediately, but it did not stop at all. I think I have to shake the audience, but I haven’t pushed a little reaction. It’s just like the kind of sleeping. In short, I’ve tried my best, I just want to go and I can only find the guards to help.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha took a slap in the mouth. "Is it a mark...and squeezed you out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably At that time, I really felt that there was a repulsion. It was like the magic had already poured enough, but it began to overflow, and then the vision returned to normal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Okay, next."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the last person walked into the office, Carter could not help Slightly surprised a moment, the other side is actually this drama writers, card payments. Fez himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just sat down and excitedly clenched his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The god is on, this is definitely the most exciting drama I have ever seen in my personal life!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "You were in the theater at the time?" Carter frowned. Since the other party had had a dispute with his wife, he had been quite resistant to the drama master. "I checked the first list of viewers and there is no you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"He was in the background, is a specially arranged seat - in fact, members of the Star Flower Troupe do not need to buy tickets when they want to watch the magic of their performance, did your wife not mention it to you? "The ice witch returned to Kakin. "In fact, it was his report that made him pay attention to this matter and sent the witch alliance to investigate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, this is my personal habit," Kajin apologized. "As long as it is a script written by myself, I always like to watch it with everyone without telling my identity. I feel that each viewer is the most direct. The reaction may be known to Ms. Mayi, but it was not disclosed to you in advance.” He said that the tone was once again excited. “I must say that this shadow is definitely a miracle in the history of drama” Because the audience rewrote its ending!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
