			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the devil flying in the front notices the changes behind it, there is still a chance to escape the gaze of the god of death - Andrea at the test It has been noticed that if the target is a dead object, such as a balloon that flutters in the wind, there is almost no accident, but the autonomous life is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware that you may be at risk, living things that dramatically change the course of motion are not within the limits of ability. It is still the same sentence - as long as the gun is fired, the bullet will definitely fall somewhere; once she pulls the trigger, the corresponding landing point is already doomed, if the target leaves the predetermined coincidence because of some subjective factors. Can escape this mortal blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before shooting and hitting occurred in the electric light and flint, so she never lost her hand, but when the distance is extended to five kilometers, the process will appear Some are too "long". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia is not surprised by this situation. After all, her ability is to pick the coin that is bound to go up, instead of applying glue under the coin. If someone violently pulls away from the carpet at the bottom, or touches the coin with his fingers, it will still fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the result of the flight crew's defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the devil is indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can’t blame it for being alert enough, even if it’s just a few hundred meters high, the whistling winds are hard to talk to, let alone the beasts are still flying in the wind. This lightning was repeatedly tested at the beginning of the program. The final conclusion is that as long as the two are separated by ten meters, the sound of the bullet penetrating into the body can be completely covered by the wind noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Andrea is giving priority to the last devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large-caliber bullet that was drilled into the body of the beast from the abdomen completely destroyed its organs, while the oblique side smashed its belly, not only making it The viscera is empty, and it also loses its ability to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing as the devil who has the slightest dissatisfaction with the only escape opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the count, a warhead descending from the sky shattered its chest and then interrupted the spine of the mount. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fearful beast in the middle of the team finally found out that something was wrong, but with its IQ, it was impossible to understand what was happening in front of the instinct. It just turned around and flew in the direction of Takira. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no different from the dead in the eyes of Andrea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She threw the third erected coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening, the ark floated out of the ground again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the map drawn by the expedition, the sniper squadron arrived safely at the resting base, a lower layer of the natural collapsed cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are still dried birds and mushrooms here?" Amy was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I collected the cockroaches!" Mai Hao shun took out a few glass bottles from a stone. "There are even spices for barbecue!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You won’t hide these things at every location?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course "Lightning is proud. "This is already a simple one. If you settle in the "Lin Zhong Ge", the food stored inside is estimated to support a banquet! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lin Zhongge? "Sherlen asked curiously. "Where is that?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A giant tree near the desolate mountain, the trunk is almost as thick as the castle," McMurray said. "We asked the leaves to put on it." On the roof, there is also a drying room, which is specially used to dry the uneaten meat. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid that only Roland can tolerate you stealing his salt and spices," Earl Speer licked his forehead. "The light is this." The bottle is estimated to be worth a few gold dragons, placed in other territories, the lord is not to stew you. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't steal it!" Mai said. "The spices are all from the ground!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"捡?" Speer The face is doubtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The buckets filled with spices in the kitchen will always leak out, I just collect them."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moreover, we are not white," added Lightning. "In the fjord, any explorer can use their charts to get rich rewards. I have painted them. A lot of maps."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, even if you empty the kitchen, you won't blame you," Sylvia said, adding a spice. What counted, I saw the night, ran to the kitchen six times a week, and wiped out the cook's dried honey fish. And not only the dried fish, but even in the study..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere at the scene suddenly dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's in the room?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Hilli was only fascinated. "Ah-no, nothing... I am just hungry, hurry to cook!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Andrea's timely rain-like firefighting Also dispelled the curiosity of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's the story...Do you really want to explore the secrets of the nightingale?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So everyone They have squandered their doubts in their minds and are busy with each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherlen ignited the firewood with electric sparks, Amy’s hands and feet cut the mushrooms, and Felice and the ashes returned a wild boar, Spey Parse is still in seasickness... In a short while, the seductive scent spreads through the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are fewer dishes than the castle banquet, it is a rare delicacies for the pancakes and dried meat strips that are often eaten in the wild. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially when the ash uses the few fat meats under the wild boar belly to fry the oil and then sprinkle it on the semi-coke mushroom slices, everyone Involuntarily took out the saliva. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild boar was eaten clean and not even hoofed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After filling the stomach, the people who rushed for a day quickly fell asleep, leaving only the most energetic extraordinary and the gods and witches responsible for the vigil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will stay in the middle of the night," Ashes filled two pieces of firewood into the fire. "Listen to Your Highness, Tilly said, your sleep time is short. But if you don't get enough rest, the impact is much bigger than the average person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Severe words can even make this body out of control," Felics calmly I admit, "But it’s still early, it’s fine to sleep later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eddy nodded, no longer talking - she is not a multilingual People, even in front of Tilly, she only listens and shares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only a burst of flames in the cave and a slight breathing of the witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Their feelings are really good," Felice looked at the sleeping girl and said, "I am afraid I can’t find it in the era of Tacharia." Like their intimate partners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes followed the other’s gaze, only to see the lightning lying on a piece of skin, on the belly Taking advantage of the shrinking of the wheat stubble, the latter and the white hair of the ground are scattered, and they are covered with two people like silk, which looks warm and incomparable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but smile. “This guy is not like this at first. Before she was accepted by the witch, she almost lived alone as a pigeon. After a few years, I almost lost the ability to speak. At that time, don't say that I am close to people, and a little noise can make her panic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I just don’t know if I can see it again after such intimacy...” Felice lowered her eyes and said, “I hope this battle of God will change.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
