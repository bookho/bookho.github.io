			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the scorpion loaded the nightingale into the battle, the situation reversed instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil made an angry roar, forced to give up chasing the flexible lightning, a roll down and rushed down to the wheat. The arm, which was still not fully recovered, lifted the spear again and swollen quickly. The skin was cracked and the blood spray spattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the shot is still strong, but the spear thrown is no longer the original power, at least the nightingale can capture the trajectory of the spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mc茜!" She patted the behemoth underneath, then unfolded the fog and took a step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷-咕!" The shape of the wheat scorpion is sharply reduced at the same time, becoming a pigeon again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grand's goal suddenly disappeared, and the spear flew between the two with a whistling sound, and fell to the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the nightingale that emerged from the fog returned to the back of the sinister wheat stalk, and the entire dodge process flowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil sends a painful mourning, only to see its arm begin to shrink inward, and finally collapsed like a strip of water. But its left hand is still holding the reins, maneuvering the mount and slamming into the two, watching the posture seems to want to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 obviously will not be as it wishes, when she is about to collide, she suddenly sinks and passes the enemy. When the balance is restored, the nightingale on the back has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter appears as a ghost behind the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy is trying to untie the ropes that fix the body, and the nightingale will naturally not give this opportunity to the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She vented her trigger with anger and the gunshot sounded continuously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This round of shooting not only penetrated the carapace behind the devil, but also penetrated its chest. The enemy made a series of hoarse voices, and soon fell into the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last evil beast who lost his master was also shot by the lightning bolt that came in, fell into the sea, and soon disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lookout slowly landed on the coast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should I do next?" The nightingale looked anxiously at Anna, and I was afraid that she would remain calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After delaying for so long, even if you count the night flight, the hot air balloon needs midnight to reach the town," Anna said in a word, "Roland must Carryed by lightning and wheat, first set off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem!" The huge head of the beast opened its mouth in the blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...no problem, let us know." The little girl’s look looks a bit low, probably because she feels herself as an explorer, but she is afraid Fighting with the enemy led to everyone getting into trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale touched her head. "No one is good at it when he is born. It is not your fault."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches tied the unconscious Prince to the back of the wheat stubble, and the broken hand was carried by lightning. The two quickly vacated and flew along the Chishui River to the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about us?" Wendy asked. "My magic is not much left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Continue to fly, how far you can fly. The enemy may send a second team to search. It is too close to the snowy mountains. We have to leave as soon as possible." Anna said, "After waiting in the safe zone, we will look again." A hidden place was set to camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her decision was unanimously endorsed by the remaining witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lookout was once again raised, and there were only five people left in the basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
