			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a transparent crimson crystal that is very similar to the magic core in the labyrinth ruins, and is also a vertically erected spindle. It's just a much smaller volume, only about half a person high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when Elena got into the Chamber, she found that its back changed its shape from a soft, smooth arc to a sharp, right angle. If you look down from the top of the relic, it is like a quarter of a circle left by a cross cut into a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the magic core, it has nothing to rely on in the air, just this is enough to prove its extraordinary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the thing that determines the destiny of mankind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Elena is full of suspicion, there is still a lingering fear of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Pasha’s statement, no one knows how it appears in front of everyone, and from the moment it appears, it’s already firmly rooted in humanity’s destiny. Connected. If you lose it, whether it is a witch or a mortal, everyone will die in an instant. In order to protect the heritage, countless people fought bloody battles and died on the battlefield against the devil. But the gods never gave them any instructions, as if they were only silently admiring it, until the ultimate winner was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of trick is simply disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you ready?" Zoe asked. "Don’t let go of the spirit when you carry the relics, don’t try to connect with the gods, remember that Pasha is How do you marry us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Relax, I remember." Elena nodded. "I count three times, how?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is more than a "cheng" gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three, two, one..." The two men held the relics at the same time and walked out slowly. It clearly floats in the air, but it is not as light as a goose. When Elena touched it, she felt that her arm was sinking, and even the body of God's penalty army felt extremely difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Passa, she would have thought she had lost her centuries of consciousness and returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "feeling effort" is spiritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relics are trying to connect with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena shook her head, and I was going to take my thoughts out of my mind. Suddenly I thought I couldn’t let go of the spirit - in this case, I must be cranky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I think is better? Men... or food... or a soft bed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you want is the feeling." A voice rushed into her mind, "comfortable, happy, painful, cold, hot, and I can Give you this. Relax your thoughts and look at me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? No, no! Elena’s eyes widened, who is talking? Is it the relic itself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned to look at Zoe, only to find that the other person’s eyes have lost their looks, like a body without a soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, what the hell is this? Pasha did not say that such an accident would happen! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, she just followed my heart and integrated into me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick release She is coming out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't do it, or you can come in and take her out..." The voice gradually changed, from the beginning of the hoarse voice to a soft Female voice, Elena even couldn’t tell if she was talking to her, or she was talking to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring her out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, she flashed Pasha’s embarrassment in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she can't watch Zoe dissipate, the body that completely loses the soul can't last long, and she must bring Zoe back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just look at the relics? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena took a deep breath and stared at the deep red crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outline of the latter was distorted, and then a darkness enveloped her. When the line of sight returned to normal, she found that the world around her had completely changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an indescribable empty hall, infinity and infinity, the dome is a deep starry sky and a huge red moon, the magic of the surface of the red moon is like boiling Lava. The four giant paintings slid down quietly, surrounding her in the middle of the front and rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is the hall, the red moon or the scroll, it gives a sense of grandeur. Although this incredible scene was mentioned by Pasha, Irina was the first to witness it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zoo! Where are you?" she shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one answered her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the picture, there is nothing in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She forced herself to calm down and cast her eye on the picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, only to take a look, Elena felt a cold sweat behind her – the same person in the painting was watching her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them is a devil wearing a beautiful armor, its pupils flashing red light, and standing up from the throne, step by step towards her Come along. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another painting is a huge eye, it is chilling that there is not only one pupil in the eyeball, but several pupils bloom at the same time. The triangles are arranged, and each one is like a big mouth with a choice of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can't help but step back two steps, and give herself a breath, this is just a moving picture, nothing to fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this idea only lasted for less than a time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw only six or seven black tentacles in the two scrolls, and flew straight to her - the front end of each tentacle has one Only tiny palms! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alena still got a response in the future, she was caught! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tentacle dragged her back and forth, and did not give each other, it seemed to treat her as a rare trophy, and Elena felt in the middle of the two paintings. It was about to be torn apart, and the unbearable pain caused her to scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait... pain? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time she discovered that she had recovered to be a witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the last experience before dying was actually pulled in half, and Elena felt the pain in her mind constantly swaying her mind, and her consciousness was blurred. Yeah... I don’t have to use the appearance of the gods to punish the army, and the emptiness is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the scene in the third painting seems to be a bit different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw that the body of the princess who had picked herself fell to the ground, and Zoe was dragging her to the dark door...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is going on, is she not integrated into the relics? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this moment, the hall suddenly collapsed, the red moon, the scrolls and the tentacles disappeared without a trace, and the long-lost pain was interrupted. ... Elena blinked and noticed that she was back in the library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dream dream? You are really mad at me. "Zou gnashed his teeth." How did Pasha tell you before? Don't connect with the gods! I also emphasized it to you at the beginning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
