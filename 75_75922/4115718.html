			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Roland raised his eyebrows. "Speak and listen?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Takira's phagocytic worms can make passages through the mountains in the mountains of the desperate mountains, so it is certainly impossible to beat them. "Itis stretches out two fingers. "As long as the two worm carriers are parallel, one can dig up one. The tunnel that can be used for carriages. On this point, I specifically asked Minister Carl to conclude that although the underground can not support an underground palace like the third side of the town, if it can guarantee a certain depth, the traffic is still no problem. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How to advance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the same time as the main force, channel The mouth is located in the center of the camp and is taken out by the shaft. The top can be used as a camp. It is disguised as an ordinary camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After evacuation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Close the shaft, restore the topsoil, but leave a venting port for the passage of the air."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What time is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will be about half a month slower than the normal march, but it is difficult to do it under the harassment of the devil. To the usual marching speed. The biggest weakness of the First Army will also disappear - from the sky, this unit will have only one fist left, which will inevitably attract the devil's attention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but tilt his mouth. It seems that after a day and night of thinking, the program is quite mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this idea yours?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay," Isis To be honest, "But the final completion is the result of collaboration between multiple departments. In addition to the Ministry of Construction, the Arithmetic Institute has also participated in it - but they do not know the specific content of the second program."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should he say that it is Northland Pearl? The most difficult thing about this program is not to think of ideas, but to use all available resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s an average person, it’s hard to include a monster-like worm carrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arithmetic Institute is a newly established institution that has not been established for less than a year. In addition to the star-gazing, it will only receive the task of Roland’s account, and she It is already feasible to try to use more professional personnel to calculate the efficiency of channel replenishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vision of more than ordinary people is really gratifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I don’t know why, he still has a illusion that Atith is more sharp than before, just like a cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job," Roland encouraged. "I will implement it according to this plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes," Northland Pearl paused. "But I still have to say that the results of the second program will still have casualties, and the process will not be easier than the battle against the Church's Cold Wind Ridge. After all, the devil is the one who takes the initiative. Before the first army arrives at the destination, it is unlikely that it will defend against the pre-set positions and bunkers as before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "So you are more inclined to stand still, wait for an opportunity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I tend to kneel down this bone anyway," she slowly In return, "If the battle of divineness is really cruel, the test of blood and fire is absolutely necessary for the First Army. It is you - I always feel that you care too much about the lives of the soldiers. So every step must be considered, but after the enemy is replaced by an unknown devil, some things are beyond the reach of manpower. Please also be prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this feeling...Roland thinks, if it was before, the other party is unlikely to say such a thing, if it is changed As other lords, they may have regarded it as an offensive word. Smart, like Isis, will not make a low-level mistake in this detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the last reaction to the chain reaction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but take care of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
