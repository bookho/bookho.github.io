			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a busy day, Ai Gesha returned to the castle and the sky was completely dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door of the residence, she accidentally discovered that Wendy was in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you are busy at this time?" The other side’s brows are slightly sloppy, but there is no blame in the words, just a simple concern, "I will be earlier Come back, at least have dinner with everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I forgot to look at the sky," Aegusa took off her coat and hung it at the door. "I thought about making the last batch of nitrogen. I didn't expect it to be dark after I went out - but you have to blame the lord, the lights in the chemical plant are no different from the daytime."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I sent you dinner," Wendy sighed helplessly. "Just on the table, it's still hot now, hurry and eat."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trouble you," Ai Gesha slightly moved. The other party is the most loved witch of the Aid, and is trusted by the lord. If it is placed in Tacila, it is at least three executives. Such a person would actually send dinner to himself, which is absolutely impossible in the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You're welcome," Wendy patted her on the shoulder. "If you feel tired, remember to call the echo to sing the song of the first hot spring, don't Feeling embarrassed... Don't forget that you are also a member of the Witch Alliance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witches League...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;After the door was closed, Ai Gesha was silent for a while before going to the table to uncover the insulated metal lunch box. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a three-in-one soup in the box, which is a savory grilled steak, fried mushrooms, bread slices and egg soup. What surprised her is that There is also a small dish in the corner of the box, which contains half a dish of honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect Wendy to notice this...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tactically fighting the devil in Tacula For decades, all kinds of supplies have become scarcer and food is naturally included. Although Ai Gesha is not in a low status, what she can eat on weekdays is nothing more than all kinds of grains and fruits that are planted by the auxiliary witches. Meat is also available, but the supply is not stable. As for spices, sugar and honey, don’t mention it. - The former two are luxury items that can only be enjoyed by the high-level federations, and even the latter have a witch who can drive the bee colony and are thrown into the battlefield instead of brewing this dispensable sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she loves to eat sweet things, especially honey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the barbecue, most people choose a combination of pepper powder and salt as a smear, and she quietly brushed a jar of honey. clean. Unexpectedly, this scene was seen by Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly felt something in her heart came up - because she couldn’t feel the cold, she was especially insensitive to warmth, rarely used in bathing Hot water, because she didn't want to trouble Anna. Taking into account his identity and origins, even the house asked Roland to arrange a separate room, just like the top of the test tower where she lived alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, she feels that the room is slightly cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, living with others is not bad? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha took out the honey and spread it evenly on the slice of bread and slowly put it in her mouth. This time, she really felt the warmth brought by the sweetness. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having dinner, she plans to watch "Primary Chemistry" and go to sleep. This knowledge may not help her further promotion, but it will not make her embarrassed in front of mortals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a large number of strangers in the chemical plant recently, listening to the white paper saying that they all came from the Wangdu Alchemy Association. Ai Gesha can see them swaying between the lab and the factory every day. Sometimes it is with Camo Spoel, sometimes Camer’s disciple Chamez takes them, but whenever they see To this group of people, there is always an expression of disbelief in their faces. Everyone can put an egg in their mouths, as if they only have this expression. And there are a few curious people who seem to regard her as a famous alchemist. When they have the chance, they will come over and ask a few words. At the beginning, they are still very simple, and later they are somewhat difficult to cope with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
