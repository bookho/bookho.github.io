			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the scorching sun, Sene Dali walked on the bank of the river wearing a straw hat to check the growth of the wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly four months of planting, wheat is now almost mature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance, you can’t see the marginal wheat field like a golden ocean, the wheat ears are thick and full, and the number of cherries is doubled, even the head They are bigger than any spring wheat he has ever seen. There is no need to wait until the harvest is weighed, and Senni knows that this year must be a bumper year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, this must be the merit of the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent ten years with his father, naturally knowing what ordinary wheat should look like, one wheat is divided into one to three ears, and each ear can produce twenty or thirty. Fruit. Whether the fertility of the soil does affect the size of the grain, but directly doubles the number of the fruit of the wheat ear? Apart from the witch, he could not think of other explanations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many changes like this, such as the towering water tower in the town - he has observed those giants up close, and manpower alone cannot make a big The iron buckets were carried to iron shelves that were taller than the residential buildings, not to mention that they were almost all built overnight. Nowadays, the townspeople who live in the community rarely need to carry their own buckets to fetch water. As long as the faucet is unscrewed, the cool well water will pour out from the pipeline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the "small island" in the center of the Chishui River. Since the ceremony was held at the Royal Highness, Miss Nana Wa was taken to the table and the witch was changed. It’s getting more and more unobtrusive. Let a piece of land emerge from the empty river, which is obviously only available to the witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once asked the city hall manager Barov about the matter, and the answer was to ignore it, and Roland’s own thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay... Anyway, the royal family always loves to do with the church. Even if the latter sends an army to slay the prince, he must win the first army before he is qualified to speak. Otherwise, the Westland can only be the western realm of Roland Wimbledon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Ryan is not the best example. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, you are coming," two serfs weeding in the ground saw Sene Dali and immediately greeted them. "Look, This field of wheat can be harvested right away, so, I would like to ask you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would it be effective to ask the Lord’s adult before saying?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right right," the serf screamed nervously. "Can we really be promoted to free people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp As the head of the Ministry of Agriculture, in addition to recording the best planting methods and statistical harvests, Senj also has an important responsibility: to communicate with the serfs and to present the policies of His Royal Highness and the City Hall to them in a timely manner. listen. Although he did not like the townships that dealt with the mud all day, the knight's self-discipline still allowed him to fulfill his task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "See those slogans?" Sene reached out to the farmland banner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, I...can't read..." The serf smiled awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Labor creates wealth, labor changes fate," he said. "That is, if you work hard, you have the opportunity to be promoted to free people. This is His Highness. The promises made, and will certainly be realized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, is it? That's great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "After becoming a freelancer, you can stay in the center of the town, have your own brick house, and get the right to receive primary education. You don't have to ask me what the slogan means in the future." The corresponding promotional content was repeated again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, adults." The serf excitedly said, "The weather is hot, do you want to sit in my shed and have a cup of cold water?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, let's go busy." He waved his hand and watched the two bow down and thanked him for a long time before returning to the field to continue his busy work. This is the question that Seny has heard the most in the past month. No matter how they preach, they will always ask again and again, for fear that the lord of the Lord will cancel the policy in the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
