			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nana Va!" Wendy glanced at her with a strange look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am really talking about it, not only the broken limbs, but also let me do a lot of experiments, such as the wings of the big cock and the gray eagle. Change and see if you can let the chicken have the ability to fly. There are also the limbs of frogs and mice, the body of cows and sheep..." The little girl said with her fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four witches took a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventy-sixth is full of interest in her words, fully studying the mysteries of ability, rather than fearing and avoiding it, obviously quite the role of the members of the guild . It is no wonder that the King is willing to accept the witch. From this point of view, he is at least not a stubborn and stereotyped old man. "What about the result?" she couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Most failed in the beginning, but after letting Lily join the trial, the success rate has increased a lot. Only after the joint, the limbs have basically lost their effect. I have to pick them up again.” Nana Watton paused. “Ah... I forgot to say that these are all kinds of connections. If they are the same kind of animal exchange, they can hardly be seen after the cure. The difference. So if you have two legs... 唔..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, please don't care," Wendy licked the little girl's mouth "On the matter of the legs, we will find a solution. Although it takes a while, but the hero can stand up one day, you can rest assured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone looked at each other and didn't dare to speak for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, let's talk about the injury of your friend first," Wendy smirked and photographed Nana's head with a smile. "Go." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy-six has quickly put on a three-point look, seven-point fear of complex look, watching the little girl go to the side, put his hands on the broken leg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring on the chest heats up again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly realized that she had a troublesome problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what kind of expression should be revealed when receiving treatment? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy-six is ​​unclear how the bones and joints that are healed by the magical healing will give the body a feeling of pain, or is it soothing? Or what does it feel like? Should she scream now, or is she gnawing her teeth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t figured out the answer yet, the little girl has taken back her hands. “Your legs are good, then your arms are up.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to lift her leg and it was already inactive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a short while, the twisted elbow returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your spirit is very good," Nanawa glanced at her strangely. "After the heavy wounds, most people will fall into a drowsiness, even If you yawn, you are still the first one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the seventy-sixth suddenly sinks and pretends to be overwhelmed." Me, I am just..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But sleeping is just a natural reaction of the body. It will not be harmful if you wake up immediately. You don't have to worry." The girl interrupted. "If you haven't been active for a long time, you may be a little uncomfortable at first. It will be better after two days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, is that true? Thank you, thank you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the gold witch who is the reviewer at the moment is not there. On the 76th, she secretly looked at Wendy and now her attention. The force was not on himself, but on the side of the side to accompany the hero, and my heart was a little relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you really good?" Amy asked with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 76th, the right hand that had been broken was waved at her. "Well, it has already healed, Miss Nana's ability is incredible..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, the worries of other witches also dissipated a lot. Amy even bite her teeth and walked to Wendy’s side, pulling her The sleeves, "Please treat my hero with my legs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
