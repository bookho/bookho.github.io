			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later, Roland returned to Bentham from the Long Song Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just got into the castle, he received two good news, the first one is brought by Barov, "Your Majesty, the astrologers of the old kings I arrived in the Winter City three days ago. Together with the craftsmen, apprentices and family members, there were a total of 312 people. I placed the nine astrologers in the diplomatic building, and others temporarily arranged for the entertainment community." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group is finally here, Roland said after a moment of indulgence, "A welcoming banquet was held in the square in the evening, I want the people to know that there is no winter." The city has another school of sages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like alchemy, astrology has a high reputation among the people, generally only Wang Both organizations are owned. Now the astrological association has also rushed to the west, and the name of the new king without the winter city is more easily accepted by everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland does not need this astrology to be divination. What he really likes is the computing power of astrologers. For the mathematics of this era, they are definitely the people who are at the forefront. Whether it is estimating the calendar or estimating the orbit of the stars, a lot of calculations are needed. With the relevant knowledge of middle and high mathematics, they will undoubtedly go further on the basis of the original. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intends to set up a number of colleges, so that these people, in addition to occasionally watching the stars of the world, put other time into the calculations - without computers In the age of many scholars, completing some complex calculations is the most efficient choice. Whether it is laying rails in the future, building large ships, installing fortillers on the mountains, and writing a shooting manual, they need their assistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty," Barov nodded and then asked, "I don't know if you have a long song..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of problems," faced with the head of the city hall, Roland did not have to hide it. "The second-grade city hall of the long song has already appeared dereliction of duty and ** phenomenon, the book is isolated. Many of the forged books, even the officials who had been transferred from the Bianbu District, had arrested two corrupt people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear this sentence, Barov couldn't help but swallow. "Is it my disciple?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was teased by the other person's cautious appearance, he shook his head helplessly, "Even They are your disciples, and I will not blame you on your head. Don't worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your wise," Barov said quickly, "then The original people in the town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the second batch of graduates passed the assessment and entered the city hall, then followed the entire team was transferred to the long song area , Luo Sighed, "Today, itâ€™s only less than a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current City Hall has produced a group of semi-leaders, one is The Long Song District is almost completely copied according to the model of Bianbu Town. In addition, the local honeysuckle Pei Luo, Elk Rennes, and some small aristocratic supplements, except for the number is slightly lower than this, the rest are all available. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other half is the one that went to the dragon collar. The number is small. In addition to assisting Count Speer to maintain the political situation, the secondary task is to try Establish a framework for a secondary city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Northland Bachelor brought back by Isis Kant to participate in the governance study of the City Hall, perhaps in a short time, Roland can make up again Half a come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has already booked this group of people to the extreme south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is the scarcity of any talent, it is undoubtedly the local officials who can carry out their own will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without them to be the foundation, even if Roland lays the entire gray fort, it is impossible to quickly gather the resources of the kingdom - the local government is an important part of centralization, he can Using the witch to quickly advance the level of science and technology, there is no way to change a large number of middle and grassroots officials out of thin air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sub-clipping nobles will never obey his orders. In the eyes of the feudal, the only important thing is the one-acre three-point land they occupy. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So everyone with administrative experience is a rare asset. Now that I have lost several people, Roland is naturally depressed. Although organizational corruption is inevitable, he thought that he could persist for more than a decade, and he did not expect it to be a year. And all the two corrupt people who came from civilians have proved in one aspect that once they have power, they may be more likely to lose their way than the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
