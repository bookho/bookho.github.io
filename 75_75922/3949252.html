			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days after the victory celebration, Roland was once again involved in the farming industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the office, the ticking outside the window keeps ringing, as if it is raining. It was the sound of snow melting. When he was in the country for the New Year, he liked to lie at the window and watched the long ice prisms under the eaves turn into transparent water droplets, dripping a little. Although there is no such leisure time at the moment, it is quite good to write the plan while listening to the sound of the earth's recovery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to previous years' experience, it takes a week or so for snow, but the land between the town and the fortress has to wait at least a month. What would happen if the mud road without hardened roads and drainage measures melted after the snow and ice melted, Roland could imagine. If he can successfully win the long song fortress, the first thing he must do is to build a hardened road between the two places for carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, what needs to be resolved first is still the issue of army building. Without a reliable and powerful army, it is impossible to defeat the Serbian army in a situation where the number is at a disadvantage. Turning the militia team into a regular army is only the first step. The specific preparation, regulatory discipline and rewards and punishments are his headaches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I played military chess as a child, I have forgotten it at the moment. After some meditation, Roland decided to make up his own. Anyway, he was the creator of the new army, and no one found it unreasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first army of Bianbu Town was soon released: the army, division, battalion, team, group as the overall framework, five people as a group (considering one The artillery requires at least five people to operate. The ten teams are a team and the ten teams are a battalion. As for the number of divisions and the army, he decided to consider it later. Given the overall level of combat in this era, as long as there are two or three battalion-level units, it is enough to defeat most of the opponents in the field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the most basic framework was settled, Roland took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next rule of discipline is much simpler, except that at all times it must obey the rules of the military, obey the sergeant, not escape, not betray, etc. Class, Roland first set the discipline, it is to ban looting and disturbing the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indulgence of the rarity of the looting is numerous, and the adverse effects on the local population can be difficult to make up for several years. This is why he insisted on using civilians as military personnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the nobles responded to the call of the lord, it was a fantasy to not participate in the looting after defeating the enemy, or that they were willing to follow the Lord’s main levy. The reason is that it can arbitrarily plunder the wealth and territory of the opponent – ​​and of course, the innocent civilians on the territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for mercenaries and bandits, not to mention. It seems that it is fierce, in fact, it can only fight the wind, and robbery is also a big source of their income. The military discipline is meaningless to this group of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the army of civilians will not regard other civilians as lambs to be slaughtered. Of course, discipline and strict punishment are not enough. The days are long, and the greed of the heart will always be magnified with the victory of one after another. Therefore, the means of reward must be kept up to the point of eradication of looting and other violations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make the rewards enough to inspire people, Roland decided to release the ultimate killer - the military meritorious field. As long as you have made a great contribution in the battle, you can grant the field. Land source Roland has thought about it, and it is the land to be reclaimed between Bianbu Town and the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a great prize in the era when 90% of the land belongs to the aristocratic class. Once they have a constant birth, these people will be closely attached to themselves. Anyone who wants to overthrow him will be the most fiercely resisted by the winners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drive the people not by words and whip, but by real interests. In other words, as long as they can always represent the fundamental interests of the people under their control, their dominance will be unshakable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the traditional fiefdom, Roland will control the area of ​​the field between a few acres and a dozen acres, which can be used for self-built houses, buying serfs or hiring farmers. I manage the fields but I cannot build an industry. In contrast, a knight's territory is close to two thousand acres, the area is equivalent to a small village. The industrial income operated above provides the operational needs of knights and attendants, such as the purchase of weapons, armor and horses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
