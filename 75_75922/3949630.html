			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Roland walked into the office with a little song and found that Wendy had already waited in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" He crossed the messy books on the ground and poured a cup of tea on the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, there is another witch in the town," she smiled and said what happened in the past few days. "If you need I can always tell Asha to go to the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first witch who awakens in her territory... This is the first harvest after public solicitation, Roland The mood could not help but be more pleasant, but after hearing the latter half of the sentence, he was curious, "Is she not in the castle now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, because the nightingale No, there is no way to review her identity," Wendy repeated the book's insistence. "We sent her back to the house and paid the first month's salary."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This decision is not bad," Roland nodded. "Let her come over to sign the contract in the afternoon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes ......" Wendy responded with a voice, and her expression seemed to be a bit of a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't feel angry... those people are for you and The view of the Witch Alliance, and..." She said after a moment of silence, "I still may not be suitable for managing the alliance with my ability. The book is more experienced than me, and the person is mature. I think it would be better for her to manage." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think you mentioned the book in these words?" Roland asked with interest. "And then she thinks that you are the most suitable candidate?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"诶?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be..." He vomited, " And my feelings are the same as her, the management skills and means can be mastered through practice, but their own character is something that is difficult to change. You have not found it, the witch is deeply loved by everyone, except for the wheat You said. The book is mainly used as the work of the Ministry of Education. It will become more and more busy in the future. There is not much time to communicate with the new witches. This is also yours. Strengths, so I have more confidence in myself. I think people are very accurate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Wendy returns, the prince goes on to say, "As for the foreign people, The Witch Alliance’s view is wrong, but I’m negligent. I haven’t thought about this body... No, my previous reputation can spread throughout the Kingdom’s mainland.” He thought for a little while, “I want to change this view as soon as possible.” In addition to increasing publicity, I feel that it is better to let the organization operate independently as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Independent...Operation?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, turn it into an independent department like the City Hall." Roland also considered this issue before. Now there are only a dozen witches in the league, and he can still cope with it. In the future, it will be expanded to hundreds of people. Even like the holy city of Takira, there are thousands of witches. It is obviously unlikely that they will arrange their work one by one. They need to establish a functional system that can run on their own to solve the witch's employment arrangements, and they only provide guidance on the purpose of use and the direction of evolution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After explaining his thoughts to the other party, Wendy hesitated, "There are hundreds of people in the city hall, and we only have more than a dozen sisters, mostly Have their own business... And, what does this have to do with changing the views of the people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Proverbs and fears come from unknown, small towns Residents are able to accept witches because they feel the benefits of Nana Va and Lily at close range.” Roland laughed. “If you can let ordinary people join the Witch Alliance, you can solve the problem of insufficient manpower in the league. It also enables them to have a deeper understanding of the organization - the spontaneous propaganda of the people will undoubtedly change the misunderstanding of the outsiders more effectively, and the content of your work and the important contributions to the town will be widely known." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as scientists are not all scientists, daily chores, administrative reception, and research arrangements require a lot of ordinary people to participate. If you want the witch to be accepted by all the people, the most important thing is to understand each other, put the witch in various industries and let ordinary people participate in the work of the witch. It is a truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
