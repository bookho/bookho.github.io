			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days later, the Seagull landed in the Winter City Knights College. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly took Nana Va and got off the plane. For the first time, she did not ask Roland the question of the special machine first. Instead, she asked eagerly. Are we not too late?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the tower project has not yet compiled the matching communication code table, the preparatory flight knights who completed the theoretical course also went to the town of thorns. The next step is real machine training, so the fastest way to contact the front line is to leave only one type of flight messenger. Although the speed of going back to the two kingdoms and going back to the day for four days is not slow, it has been a long time for the urgent treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you are just coming." Roland replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, that's good... Next time I will adjust an empty knight student to stay in the winter, in case of this need." Tilly sighed. "Yes, who is the injured?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Roland was dumb, and the flight messenger had limited information. Therefore, he did not mention too much detail, just let Tilly send Nana Vah back to no winter as soon as possible. Now when asked about this, he found that he did not know how to explain it. After a moment of indulgence, he began to say, "A person who does not exist in this world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha?" Tilly took a slap in the mouth, "You are Refers to the dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the five kings, the reaction is not a general sensitivity... Roland coughs twice, “It’s almost what it means.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you can't just say it, you have to turn around." Tilly gave him a disgusted look. "Why, you are afraid that we will find it hard to get back from a thousand miles away, but Is it a dissatisfaction for an illusory dream?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A pinpoint." Nanawa echoed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have to say it," Wendy shook her head with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You guys three - is this singing a double spring? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a good thing to know that guilty conscience, brother." Tilly picked up her toes and reached for his chest. "But you are too small to see everyone." - Since it is something you feel is necessary to do, even if it is ridiculous, we will do it first. Then... what should I do next?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This...is probably another way of expressing trust? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pressed Tilly’s head and exhaled a white airway. “Go back to the castle, the book is already waiting for us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sufficient advance preparation, Nana Va quickly created a large number of "magic stitches" ". According to her, even if they don't know how to sew, they can be cured by placing them near the wound. The only trouble is to take them out afterwards. Otherwise, these unfixed sutures are likely to bring new to the injured. The problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that the real thing will not disappear in a vacuum, the book scroll can only get a lot of stitches by repeatedly going in and out of the consciousness circle, so Nanawa can survive Under full magic, enchant for subsequent medical equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the preparatory work took five days, it was only a moment for the dream world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the people involved in the dream are likely to be aware of the same, such as Jieluo, such as Wajilis... but Roland is now Nothing to care for those. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When everything is ready, he takes a deep breath and compares the book with other witches with a reassuring gesture, taking the lead to close his eyes and enter the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the familiar scene reappears in front of you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing the cold is still lying in the pool of blood, while the other two are looking at him with surprise, Jie Luo can not wait to grab his sleeve "Uncle, can you help me to save her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not explain much, quickly took out his mobile phone and dialed the phone of Garcia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budo Conference has been successfully concluded. Without an accident, Garcia should live in the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phone is quickly connected, "Hey, is there anything?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are now Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suddenly sinks in his heart, "Why not stay Home?" If this program fails, he can only choose the alternate plan and inform the association to guard the transfer. Not only does it take more time to explain, but it does not necessarily achieve the results he expects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what is your attitude? Can I go downstairs to buy some snacks?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;He suddenly sighed, "So you are in the community? Is the car key on the body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"nonsense," the phone over there Camsia didn't have a good voice. "So what do you want to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland coughed twice and turned to the most solemn tone, "Listen well. I have a lifetime request, and this is only you can do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Her momentum suddenly fell down," That...do you have to say it on the phone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s too late. You are now driving to Liuli Pavilion, two blocks away. A lady named a book. She will stand at the intersection waiting for you, and you will never miss her. Then you will send her to the Xijiao high-speed bridge, which is where I am at the moment." Roland Aton, It takes about 30 minutes for the two places to drive normally, but I don't have that much time. So you have to get there at the fastest speed, and all the troubles caused by me will be borne by me - please, please let me go now!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The silence was silent for a few seconds, followed by a rhythmic running sound. "That is, you don't have time to explain further?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, if I waited there, I found this and If it doesn't matter, you should know how serious the consequences will be!" At the moment the engine ignited, she hung up. "And, this is what you owe me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland then pressed the number that guarded the Rock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time he roughly outlined the process of the matter. "Miss Fijian is now seriously injured and needs the best doctors and equipment to be treated. But these are not enough. Garcia is now rushing to the scene with the key life-savings. If possible, I hope that the association can coordinate the transportation department and control the roads along the way so that she can reach the bridge as soon as possible." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meteorite should immediately go down and tell them that they will immediately contact the relevant department to handle the matter. However, Roland also knows that if there is no prior communication, the possibility of the government responding in time is very embarrassing. If you can arrive smoothly, you still have to look at Garcia himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time was almost five minutes after I dropped the phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing he can do is to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the traffic in the big winter is not high, the closer to the suburbs, the more so, as long as it is not the peak period, Jiaxia should be able to open Out of the speed that the van is hard to reach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uncle, Master, She... She... I can't do it!" Suddenly, Jielu interrupted Roland's thoughts with a crying cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland quickly returned to Fiji’s cold side, only to see her chest that had been slightly trembled before, and now she is completely silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She’s her heartbeat and breathing stopped.” Wakiris frowned. “Although I don’t know what method you came up with, I’m afraid it’s time. It’s too late.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
