			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortal can't beat the devil, Isabella thinks, so the church has a god penalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are infinite, painless, and fearless, and are the best weapon against the devil. Although there is no ability to act autonomously, it is not necessarily a disadvantage when marching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This powerful force is naturally not resisted by the servant's garrison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially the loss of the support of the city wall, want to beat these church elites in close combat, it is a heavenly night talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden torrent is the trial army, the large force from the main entrance of the Wolf Heart City, and the garrison team gathered together. The red embellishment is the gods, they climbed to the top from the collapse of the wall as they were flat, and began to kill the enemies who tried to stabilize their positions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you like to help them?" She turned to look at Jieluo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter yawned, "No, my magic is limited and must be reserved for important goals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can fight with swords, hammers, and cymbals," Isabella grinned. "They can't beat you anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Jie Luo shook his head. "I went to them to win easily. I can easily win without them. This meaningless thing, I don't want to do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," she changed the subject. "Why did you do that before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Playing with the captive, the bishop’s face is stiff," Isabella worried. "He doesn't seem to like this trial. And the next pope is probably his You may suffer from it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May is angry because he has not yet become a pope," Jie Luo said indifferently, "etc. He walked into the pivot The top-level library in the temple will naturally understand that this is the way to please the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What... practices?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Playing with it," the pure man licked the long, snowy hair that was blown away. "The gods never came to the world, and did not shelter the world. Just use a vain goal, let us The former servant went to approach it, eager to get its gift. Is this like the trial just now? I have at least given him a clear goal, but the gods have nothing, it does not even guarantee that the goal is real, or Say, everything is a slang that we try to figure out. Even so, we still don't care... oh, this is the most thorough play."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is in the end Say, why can't you understand one sentence? Isabella frowned. "Have you been to the library?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," she shrugged. "These are all under my arm. He is not a witch, and his life is nearing its end. I heard that when the mortal is coming, the scene in my life will be reviewed again, and I can’t help but want to find someone to talk to. He even intends to let me engulf before dying. He."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I certainly can't, this will let Mei "The big man is furious," Jie Luo interrupted. "Reassured, I know what can't be done." She smiled mysteriously. "There is still a possibility, if I lose it? I don't want to send my body. Give him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think so, if you lose, chances are that nothing will happen." Isabella sighed, this guy It's a strange person, probably related to her ability - after engulfing so many people, there is almost no feeling in the world that she hasn't experienced yet. So Jielu is rarely keen on one thing. Everything she does is for fun, and it must be unusual fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella moved his gaze back to the battlefield. Suddenly, a group of desperados appeared in the city, and they rushed to the ranks of the gods. Most people are screaming through the spears when they are close, but there are still a few netted fish close to the gods. Then the explosion sounded, and the rising smoke covered the gap in the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
