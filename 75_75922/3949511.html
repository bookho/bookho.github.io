			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean stunned, he stared at the old man in front of him, wanting to see something from the other's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is a cloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His gaze is no longer as deep as he used to be, and he can pierce people. He may have the wisdom that the Pope has taught, the knowledge gained from the Holy Scriptures, but... everything is not up to the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Majesty is not joking, Mayn realizes that his journey has come to the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes are a bit fuzzy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He once again kneels and touches his forehead, and this time he did not call him up as usual, but waited for him to complete the full set of actions. Open the way, "You come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian of the service put the pope on a cart and then pushed him to the gate of the secret area. After Mein followed, the group left the sacred temple and turned into a narrow tunnel. On the smooth stone wall, there is a glowing spar in each ten steps, and you can't see the end at first glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I donâ€™t know how long it took, Mayn left the passage, and the line of sight suddenly became brighter, and the foot became a flat slate floor, and I could see the angular wall. And the chandelier hanging from the top of the ceiling, it is obvious that this secret road is connected to a basement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are underground in the Cathedral of the Old Holy City," probably seeing his confusion, the Pope said, "The structure here is exactly the same as the cathedral." It was built backwards, I used to call it a reflection church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The underground of the cathedral?" Mayn surprised. "I always thought there." There is no basement at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no, because the two are not connected," Oberlin smiled. "Only from the underground passage of the secluded area. Come here. The top plate is made up of a mixture of several slabs of slate and clay. The general method can't be cut through."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why...what should I design?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to keep the secret, but not to completely bury the secret," he said, "Any Pope will come to the reflection church before the throne, to witness the church. Establish, develop, and grow, while keeping the goals of the church in mind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Defeat the devil. "Mayne Su channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But O'Brien didn't nod his affirmation, but sighed, "No, the child is to win the smile of God."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop yelled, "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope did not respond to him, but commanded the guards to move on. According to the direction of the stairs and the ramp, they should be climbing upwards. Soon the group came to a magnificent hall, and Mayn recognized it according to the familiar structure around it. It should be the prayer room of the reflection church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick wooden door was slowly pushed open, making a squeaking sound. Although it seems that the Pope has not visited the hall for a long time, he did not smell the dust... Obviously there is always someone responsible for cleaning up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They can only send me here, and then you will push me in." Oberlin said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty." Mayn took the handle and pushed the Pope into the prayer room. The wooden door behind it closed again, completely separating the light from the torch. . Now, only the soft glow of the indoor yellow spar is left - like the secret passage arrangement, it is evenly embedded on both sides of the wall, but the difference is that there is a huge portrait above the spar. It is vaguely remembered that the position of the frame should be exactly the opening of the window in the prayer room above the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contents of the portraits are similar, they are all bust of the characters, they are wearing gorgeous robes, they are full of spirits, they are looking at each other. Visitors into the prayer room. And Mein saw the portrait of Oberlin's majesty in it - he was almost like a real person in the painting, staring at himself with a smile. This strange feeling made him unable to bear a chill, and the goose bumps on his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
