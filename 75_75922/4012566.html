			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the town of Bianbu... No, no winter city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis walked down the ramp and looked at the busy and orderly scene in front of me, and could not help but be stunned. Although she had made various speculations before she arrived, she found that she was still underestimating the city. The area of ​​the dock area was three times larger than that of Wangdu, and it was packed with unloading sailboats and concrete boats. The ore and coal placed on the yard piled up into a small hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, ten paddle boats are lined up in a column and slowly leave the trestle, and many people are standing next to the embankment. The people on board were all dressed in uniform uniforms, standing straight along the sides of the ship, and the spirit of the show was even felt by Itis. In the past, this kind of expression will only appear on the knights who have returned, and these people have no The doubts are not nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central part of the terminal is a gathering place for merchants, refugees and migrants. It is mainly composed of various types of sailing boats. People are separated by a group of black people after they disembark. Come and ask them to join the growth team by checking the level. It is the entire quayside area, and there are no more than a thousand floating populations. Such a prosperous scene is even dwarfed by the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The dock has grown longer," Victor groaned. "Is it going to turn the entire river bank into a quayside?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And?" Isis noticed the other's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least in the fall of last year, the dock here was not so wide," he spread his hand. "Of course, there are not so many people."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the levels of doing, tax collection?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no city tax here. "You have to pay taxes only when you sell things," Victor said enthusiastically. "And the city is not free to set up stalls. All sales must be carried out in the convenience market in the square. Those black people are equivalent In other cities, patrols set up levels to register their identity and remove plagues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not extortion and extortion? Itis made a look at her brother, who nodded and pulled out the money to prepare for the money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, Miss Conrad, I mean "equivalent" patrol," the gem businessman smiled and waved. "In fact, they never Charge extra fees - I know it's hard to believe, but that's the truth. I was as surprised as you were when I first passed the exam. Come with me, the merchant channel is much faster. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said, the black man verified the identity of Victor and let the group pass all the levels, no copper eagle Ask for it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, I have to find a clean and comfortable hotel, then go to the convenience market," he turned his head. "Your plan, Miss Conrad? If you are not familiar with this, I can help you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you," said Itis with a grateful look, pinching the skirt and slightly bending her knees. "You helped me a lot along the way, this is enough." I will go to the town hall for help, and I should be able to find the news of my loved ones. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s just a matter of raising your hand... It’s my pleasure to be able to meet you like a noble lady, please don’t hesitate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After shirking it, Itis was hard to get rid of Victor's entanglement. Finally, when the businessman said goodbye, he continued to wave at her, saying that if he met If you are in trouble, you can always go to the Holy Mountain Inn to find him.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sister, you are really popular," Cole whispered.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm? Itis gave him a look. "What should you call me?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...cough, Ms. Isis," the second son of the Duke could not help but tremble. "Let's go to the hotel to stay?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, go to the castle to submit the documents first," she said without hesitation. "Get in touch with your Majesty as soon as possible." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we don't have a head..." Cole whispered.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
