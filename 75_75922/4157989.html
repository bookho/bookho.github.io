			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, the god of God has finally risen to a height of nearly five kilometers from the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a distance, it is like a mountain cone that is fixed in the clouds, and the shadow cast even blocks a third of the dawn kingdom. Let the afternoon dusk be an early morning. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not prepared by the top, ordering civilians not to go out, and martial law in various cities, I am afraid that this vision can cause order to collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of God began to slowly move southeast of the Grey Fort, and the shadow of the moving shadow created a distinct "dawn line" on the ground. Although the Lord of Silence and Scorpio can't control the core instrument, it's no problem to turn off the red fog valve. This is the only good news - at least it won't spill the red fog everywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to monitoring the movement of the god of God, the Witch Alliance and the Grey Fort Executive Office have not been idle, in the mutual cooperation, in just two days Across the majority of the Grey Fort, a magic core and related operators are traversed to the route that the floating land will pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpacking the closed wooden box, Roland saw Celine in the temporary building of the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call... Even if the carrier doesn't need to breathe, this small migration experience is hard enough." She stretched out the tentacles of the whole body as if stretching a big Lazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Working hard," said Roland sincerely. Of course, he knows what it feels like to be enclosed in a wooden box that can't move, especially for people with claustrophobic fears. This experience can definitely make people crazy. If it is not time-critical, large bombers capable of transporting heavy loads are still being assembled, and he is not willing to use this method to transport ancient witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not good enough compared to the sufferings of the past." Celine turned around and said, "Let's say, you have to work with the devil." I am even more surprised - Your Majesty," it bends down the Lord and suppresses the voice in consciousness. "Are you sure you can do this? They are enemies without humanity and compassion, and fraud is nothing but for them. To be honest, if you don't come up with it, Ellen will definitely refuse to lead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, I know what I am doing. Roland also replied with consciousness. "The god of God must not fall on the territory of the four kingdoms. We cannot afford this loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The two powers are light, and this is the choice that three seats often need to make.” Serin’s voice suddenly softened a lot. “I believe in your judgment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp; "It’s not Elsie who is good at operating the core instrument," Roland said with a whim. "Otherwise, I have a headache."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are wrong," Celine smiled. "She did complain a lot after hearing this, but it was Elsie who stuffed me into the box."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned, and the heart could not help but surge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, where is the high-level devil you said? I can't wait to board the floating city."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." This reaction is somewhat unexpected. "Do you really want to go up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Of course! This is an opportunity to study the new core! You can use the stone of the gods to gather magic, and turn it into super buoyancy, think about it is exciting!" Celine's tone suddenly turned, "Not to mention that it is a city of the devil, the city! You have to know that during the war of the whole gods, no one has ever been able to enter a city of the devil, let alone occupy it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, what you said is really reasonable..." Roland turned and walked to the corner of the storeroom, "Follow me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear After a special gate, Heckzod and Cerroshhi are waiting for the action in the middle of the room. They are surrounded by dozens of gods and witches, and both sides have big eyes and small eyes. He said to be cooperation, but which side will be really worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Seeing Celine’s first sight, Hecksod picked his eyebrows in surprise, "The carrier of the underground civilization? The witch Is it integrated with it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only Nasopelle is willing to turn himself into a monster." The Scorpio Lord does not seem to want to continue on this issue. "Because you are ready, let's start."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The details of the action have been discussed before, now everyone is there, I repeat the main steps." Roland looked around, "The core of the god of control is located on the lower level of the obelisk, which is full of Red fog, so the main action personnel are the gods and the first army. The possible enemy is the symbiosis, which is the terrible, so you can't make a move - the first army will set up a defense point at a key position, and wait until the surrounding security In order to reach the core, the main task of the definitive witch is to protect Catherine, and this will be handed over to you both." He stared at Felice and Zoe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked together and said, "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Heikezod Due to the implementation of the second program in advance, there are still hundreds of thousands of inferior bodies and thousands of madmen in the future. They have been obeyed by the Maharaja and will not cause any hindrance. As for the high-order devils who have been obeyed by the mask, they have been "convinced" by the silence. The only thing that can't be controlled are the territories that were created. Although Hecksod has closed the gates of the hatchery, no one knows how many guards are in the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So...start!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland ordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod made a snap, and a dark magical curtain unfolded behind it, with a red mist like a tulle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two monarchs first disappeared into the door of distortion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a godly witch and Celine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the side door of the warehouse was opened, and a thousand soldiers who were ready to go carried all kinds of equipment into the portal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City Plan is officially launched! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...the interior of the devil's city..." Celine couldn't help feeling Tao, this is the first time she has set foot on the enemy's core area, so close observation of the obelisk. Although she knew that it was extremely large, she still felt a bit shocked when she saw it at a close distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when they are at the bottom of a huge pothole, this red mist tower that rises from the foggy lake and is hundreds of meters wide is like A pillar of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?" Felice asked as she watched around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First let the mind connect to the control core." She looked at the magic core of the head around the obelisk. "The core instrument can be implemented by changing the structure." Different abilities, as for the specific "insight" or "balanced" connection, I have to try to know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Balance? Isn't that the name of the magic stone? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a sense, the core of magic and the magic stone are not much different. The biggest difference is only in scale and complexity. In fact, look After the research manuscript of Miss Isabella, I even felt that the witches did not differ much from them - essentially we all use the same way to drive the magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp; Felice silent for a moment, skipped the topic, "After the connection?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After connecting, I can further analyze the devil The core structure is like the ability to analyze a witch with a magic stone. The requirement of the majesty is to let it land smoothly, then reduce Its effect should be achieved - it is much easier than creating a new ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Felice, Lord Catherine," Bryan Come over, "The first army has been armed, and then you will see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin little bit of the main, then insert it together to bring The magic core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the core of the core began to bloom in a blue light, slowly rising from the inverted state, and floated into the air from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
