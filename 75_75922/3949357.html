			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days passed quickly and the line of defense was basically constructed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stood on the high platform behind the position, as the evil moon confronted the evil beast, and inspired the entire army of the First Army in the presence of the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale has sneaked into the battlefield with a reply because of his special task. The witch who took over the responsibility of protection was Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland himself wore a coated armor with two revolvers at his waist. If it weren't for the full collapse of the line of defense, it would be difficult for him to be threatened by the fish that fled the net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy is about ten kilometers away from here, hehe!" The huge pigeon descended from the sky and landed on his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job, keep watching," Roland took a piece of beef jerky from his pocket and handed it to the mouth of the wheat. She dried the meat two or three times. I swallowed it, then spread my wings and flew east. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the lightning and McDonald's rotation investigation, he clearly understands the enemy's movements, so he can calmly arrange the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mad warrior who deals with peony, itâ€™s not safe to line up the slender battle line, especially in the lightning report, hundreds of people carrying The spear makes him particularly concerned. If he didn't guess wrong, it is probably the weapon that the other party used to preempt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general throwing weapon does not have a range of more than 50 meters, but that is for ordinary people, the militia can take the spear after taking the pill. How far is it, Roland is not very clear, but once it exceeds 100 meters, it will pose a threat to the firearms. Therefore, he simply chose to put down a batch of bunkers, implement urbanization tactics, and use construction congestion, firearms to seal the road, and artillery to form an insurmountable line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a sufficient amount of cement, it is easier to build a bunker faster than a walled city wall, although a single-storey brick bunker is somewhat fragile in structure, but for The militia team carrying heavy siege equipment is already an indestructible task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten bunkers are arranged in a diamond shape on both sides of the road to form a crossfire. Each bunker is equipped with 24 soldiers, half of the recruits veterans, skilled veterans responsible for shooting, and new recruits responsible for loading ammunition. Soroya also painted "optical camouflage" for the bunker. Standing in the distance, the bunker and the surrounding environment are almost integrated. It is difficult to tell the difference between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rear of the line is the artillery unit, twenty artillery pieces are lined up, the shooting sequence is still the same as the previous one, according to the lightning signal to adjust the angle of the artillery and Load the corresponding ammunition. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also an emergency force around the shelling position, about a hundred people, equipped with a gun to protect the artillery and the prince of the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the spirited and morale of the soldiers in the line of defense, Roland felt a little bit in his heart. Initially thin and weak, the people who signed up for the army to enter the army, after the demon moon and the baptism of the town defense war, can now shoulder the heavy responsibility of defending the home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, the enemy is only two kilometers away from us," the fly back reported the little girl lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, the monitoring task will be handed over to Mai Mai, you can go through the woods and release the shelling signal." Roland nodded, then turned and turned The chief knight said, "Call me to order, all members of the First Army, enter the combat position, ready to meet the enemy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes!" Carter salute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lehman felt that his hands were getting more and more heavy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two days were still burning pains, and now almost lost consciousness. The armor can no longer put on the swollen and blue arm, leaving a red and black mark on the part hit by the hammer. The skin blinks like a layer of shine, some transparent and shiny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be that the bone is broken, he thought, without treatment, this arm will not be able to keep it. Although the analgesics found in the church can alleviate the pain, they cannot regenerate the broken bones. He decided to wait until the end of the battle and immediately return to Wangdu, where there are the best pharmacists and alchemists in the Grey Fort, who should be able to heal the damn internal injuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
