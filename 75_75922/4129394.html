			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No winter people soon ushered in the start of the game. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the first Victory Day Games were extremely rushed and rudimentary, there was neither an opening ceremony nor a live commentary, but it was undoubtedly a grand event for the locals. celebration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one needs to call or organize. After the day has just turned, people spontaneously flock to Kingdom Avenue to fight for a good position. Since the snow has not yet been opened, the small bench or the felt cushion is almost one person, and the whole family is not even out. This migratory scene has made the tour operators amazed, and the hawkers who pre-judged the situation have already carried their bags full of food and drinks, and sold them out with the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the boulevard where the end of the game is located at noon is nowhere to be found. It is estimated that there are about 10,000 people, and there are still people from both places. Coming to it - this allowed Roland to once again appreciate the enthusiasm of the people of the era for entertainment. It is definitely not an easy task to walk with twenty-eight kilometers on foot. He deliberately set the competition time at two o'clock in the afternoon to give the people ample preparation time, but I did not expect that everyone's response still exceeded his expectations. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the King of the Grey Fort, he naturally does not have to be crowded with the people. As early as one day ago, the Ministry of Construction set up a place to accommodate 100 people. A stepped view of the stage for use by senior officials without winter. Around it is the line of defense built by the first military wall, separating the viewing platform from the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, this is the list of participants, a total of 1,462 people." The book roll came over with a thick stack of paper, "but Limited by the registration time, there are only the simplest classifications and statistics, if you can give me two more days..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem," Roland waved "The sports meeting itself is to fight the heat. If it is dragged to the expedition, it will lose its original intention."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flipped through the list and found that the other side Modest – the above classification has not only been refined into the residential community, but also attached to the simplest life summary and work experience. It is possible to find out this information in such a short period of time, and probably only the book can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the list, he saw several interesting names. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the old buddy is about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia’s sister Ling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the original Alchemists Association trio, etc...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, even There is no witch participation in this Games. They also have little hope of winning. Basically, they are directed at the slogan of "Re-engagement" in propaganda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most promising places to win the rankings are mostly on the first page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put his gaze on the top two people - dawn dawn, film, Schilt and chief knight, Carter Lannis, "You think the championship Was it born between the two of them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book rolled up the hair and smiled, and did not answer directly, but her expression has given the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, time is almost up." Barov, who is sitting in the lower position, reminded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Roland put down the list and brought up the phone next to him. "So let the game begin."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I always have something to understand," wearing a desert-style fighting robe, warming up in the crowd The action of the Goulds snarled and said, "The city of the Grand Chief is divided into two regions. Right? Since they are running together in the middle, how can he guarantee that everyone starts at the same time? The most important thing in the holy duel is fairness. If you lose your fairness, not only can this honor not be discussed, but it may also damage the great name of the chieftain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows, and this is not the point at all Ok? "Father..." Rohan screamed hard. "Can you take the headband off your head? There is also a suede wrapped around the waist..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
