			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test of the change in ability after the book was promoted did not take much time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, before Roland’s arrival, she had already discussed with Anna seven seven eight eight eight—the answer that appeared behind the arithmetic was not an illusion, but it was not Calculated by calculation, but the result of searching for memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the data contains a large number of reusable formulas, the book just looks at them, so the answer is directly in the mind. Especially for those complex functions, if each of the small items is memorized, then the total item after the combination can be quickly solved, even if the specific meaning of the expression is not understood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the examination of the examination papers and archives, the amount of work done is obviously much larger, and it was not impossible in the past. But now she can achieve this in a subconscious way, obviously its main ability has been improved to a considerable extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those that have not been memorized or partially memorized will not receive any answers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to calculate the reliability of a new design sample, it must be done by the design institute and the central carrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just a matter of reading through the book first, it can save a lot of work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main highlight of the test is still placed in the field of ideology "archives" - although it is currently simply a small room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to be determined is the rules of exchange of goods between the two worlds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the book is super-excellent, and the way to enter the world of dreams is fundamentally different from the witch of the gods and the monarch of the nightmare. The former must rely on the light column to reach the dream, and the latter is even more arrogant, so that even its own form has been changed. The way of the book is more like a docking, as if driving a car into the parking lot, whether it is the body or consciousness, has maintained a fairly high integrity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can take the goods in the parking lot together, the significance is self-evident! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it turns out that there is not such a wonderful thing in the world. Books can “carry” the carry-on items into the field, but they cannot bring things back to reality in the realm of the realm of the world, even if it is a stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the introduction is not completely accurate, because those test items did not disappear out of thin air, but still held in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry... Your Majesty." After several tests, the book looked at his empty hands and said with some frustration, "My ability seems to have something to do." Insufficient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, this is in my expectation, you don't need to care." Roland and Anna looked at each other and they reached a conclusion. The archives are probably the same as the dream world. There are more or less distorted forces of reality. As long as they are within the scope of the book, they can be reproduced as they are. At first glance, it seems to bring the outside things into the consciousness circle. But it is impossible to bring it back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also gave Roland a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you know that you can open up the field in the conscious world, it’s not just a book. According to the information obtained from Wakiris, the king of the devil family not only has the "master of the Holy See", but also has strong control over the field. When it is in it, it is almost the same as the god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the creations of the two worlds can be exchanged at will, then the battle of divineness will obviously be filled with more risks and uncertainties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next test is the inclusiveness of the domain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since talking to him, he has speculated that the dream world is also an area in the conscious world, but it is a bit exaggerated. Although he can't make a storm in the dream like the king of the devil, the commonality of the field should be universal, such as accepting consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light beam key after the promotion of the book has been expanded to a meter or so, although there is still a certain gap from the requirements of the winners, it is already ranked No. The four witches are second only to Roland, the leaves and Evelyn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these ancient witches enter the dream because their light column is just covered by the dream light column, can they enter the archives in the same way? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test results made Roland feel very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of his sleep, Felice relied on the field of books to regain its appearance four hundred years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This undoubtedly verified his speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outline of the conscious world gradually became clear in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that the number of people entering the column and the range of the light column does not seem to be a simple analogy. Even if four goddess of worship are sleeping close to the book, only one person can reach the file. Pavilion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it is enough to be able to enter one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final focus is to locate the archives and determine their position in the dream world - if the high-rise buildings seen in the book are really a scene in the dream Then she and Roland will surely meet in the conscious world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the verge of the test, Anna stopped the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since I met Roland, I never envied any more People, because I think this is the biggest gift of my life," she said slowly. "Even if it is learned that the witch can enter the dream - they have suffered too much hardship, and the dream is for them. More is a kind of compensation. But... I really envy you now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words did not avoid other witches, but In the face of everyone’s face, there was also a stir in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow... Why do I feel that my face is a bit hot?" Mystery Month quickly covered his face, but deliberately pinched his fingers, revealing two gaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet, don't interrupt!" Lily glanced at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna..." Roland couldn't help but speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna smiled at him and then looked at the book, "So I have a request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The book is soft, "Please, my Highness, as long as it is something I can do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He told me about the world of dreams before. There is only a verbal description and no picture. Can you take a picture of the world where he lives, the place where he lives, and the scenery of the world?" Anna said seriously, "If you record the picture," In the book of magic, should I also be able to see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, pack it on me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow--" The riddle suddenly slammed. "I want to see it! It's best to take the entire city!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You shut up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, before Lily took her, other witches followed the drums, "Can take pictures on the legendary Hundreds of people Airplane?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I want to see what a square that can hold tens of thousands of people at the same time!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And me, and me--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the sisters surrounded the book and Anna, Lily’s feet, also Then squeezed it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale sighed in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably this is why Anna is going to be in front of herself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could not help but reveal a bitter smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I clearly think that my feelings are no less than the other side, but in the eyes of the public can still say this, probably only Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
