			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly sits at the desk and writes a secret letter that will be sent to the island on a small note. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the need to use the flight messenger to send, she must minimize the writing and show the meaning in the most concise language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content is actually not complicated, two or three sentences can be summarized, but somehow, she can't stop the pen in her hand. It seems that there is a kind of emotion that is pulling her, so that she does not consciously write a book like a book - let the mind out of control, it is a rare thing for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Tilly unexpectedly found that this feeling is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is not a matter of life and death, she will let it go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slim ink marks slowly spread on the letter paper, making people can not help but give birth to a warm flavor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Camilla."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The demon moon is over, and the west is again The calm was restored. The Victory Day celebration was particularly interesting. Do you remember the hot pot I told you? Roland directly moved this practice to the town square, using four huge iron pots to make a thick soup and then meat. Blocks, leaves, whole chickens and birds and mushrooms were thrown into the soup, and the scent that came out was heard even across the Chishui River. He also said that the hot pot is a feature of the winter city and has to be tasted."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under Roland’s encouragement, everyone has the kind of learning to put all kinds of foods into the pot. I have to say that there is a thick soup base, no matter what. It’s a taste in your mouth. Whether it’s a city hall official, a witch’s union, or a common lord, there’s no difference between them. It’s probably impossible to see in the past. Just witnessing this passionate scene. It’s hard to imagine how long it will take for a brutal war that will determine the fate of all people to come to the world. Because of this, this kind of joy is especially precious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am writing to tell you that no winter city is really an incredible place - I have no plans Let you put down the prejudice against the nobility, but Roland Wimbledon is not a nobleman at all. Not surprisingly, I just confirmed the previous guess, he is just like us, the so-called aristocratic identity is just a past, or It’s a cover-up. So you should also take a look at this new city. Sleeping islands need to be stationed, but I don’t want you to take this responsibility as a cage that binds you.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, this evil month, our witch is no longer just standing by, and Roland’s main plan for the extreme south is about the ashes, Andrea, and Echo. As for the desert. The interesting things that happen in this place are not described here, so I can wait and see later. I believe that the rest of the island will become more and more important after other sisters come."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Write to Sleeping Island housekeeper? "Just then, a hand suddenly stretched over from behind Tilly, the cup of sky-blue drink in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," she smiled a little, and she didn't have to look back and knew that the other party was ashamed. "Just write your part, do you want to see it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still can't," Ash licked her shoulder and whispered, "I have to prepare for today's dinner."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then go, I am looking forward to your delicious," Tilly laughed. The witches usually dine with Roland in the castle parlour, so the small kitchen in the residence rarely produces fire, but the two are separated for several months, and the ashes want to share the dinner with her alone. Of course, she will not refuse, let alone God also secretly claimed to get a magical condiment from the extreme south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After drinking a chaotic drink that was as refreshing as an ice spring, she wrote it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's talk so much, let's talk about business."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow me With his agreement, when the spring was the time of migration, now it is time for action, and my thoughts have not changed, everything is as perfect as expected, so it is better to follow the plan - I I believe that you are well prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the end of the evil month, the fjord's trade route will soon be busy, and it will be difficult for a while. Hire enough free boats and sailors. If you have such troubles, you can ask the Thunder for help. He is arranging the adventurers who are looking for the sea line. The boat and the people are not a problem. The steel ship built by Roland for him is launched. Before, the Thunder will stay in the fjord. If you contact him, he will definitely help us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
