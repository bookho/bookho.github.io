			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a good laugh at the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rapid expansion of the size of the Executive Office, the average age of officials has also dropped, and with the implementation of the assessment system, the younger generation is learning knowledge and new The ability to accept things has shown a natural advantage - 20 years of completion of primary education, become a grassroots clerk, 25-year-old promotion to departmental cadres, and even core officials, is not impossible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there are quite a few young faces in the castle conference hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the new generation of officials who were slightly reddened and embarrassed to bow their heads, Roland couldn’t help but raise his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this group of people is not as good as the older generation in terms of means and maturity, their vigor and tenacity can bring unparalleled vitality to the whole organization. It is also the temperament that an emerging government needs most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, maximizing the population without winter city is the goal that everyone needs to work hard - including the planning and construction of housing and supporting facilities. Keep up. Double is not the end. I don't have an end. You just need to know that the more the number, the better - so your own 'struggle' is part of it." He summed up after the laughter subsided. Considering that the integer is more readable, let's call it the "Million Plan". "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officials are eager to caress the chest.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next few decrees are the Million Plan Supplements or extensions, such as the exploration of resources on the fertile plains; the establishment of a number of full-time schools and specialized schools to further normalize universal education; the medical staff from military training to private recruitment, and the establishment of small in new communities The clinic is to share the pressure of the only medical institution. At the same time, the Ministry of Education has added a secondary discipline: medicine, which selects skilled hands from the field emergency team for semi-self-study training, and the textbook is related textbooks collected from the dream world...etc. Etc.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding a city with a population of 200,000 into a city with a population of 400,000 or even millions is not just a simple change in numbers. The expansion requires more infrastructure to operate effectively, otherwise the domestic sewage and excrement can destroy the livable environment that is difficult to build. The high concentration of the population puts higher demands on the health and epidemic prevention work, namely Lily’s ability to monitor and forecast is also a problem that needs to be explored.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of education is self-evident – ​​there is no extensive literacy education The population can only be a burden, not the help of industrialized production.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the reason why he pointed out that this meeting is only a framework, and wants to build a hundred The big city with a population of 10,000 people can not be decided at one or two sessions. To find a road suitable for the gray fort, you need the administrative department to constantly explore and practice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Just as everyone was excited about this plan to build the largest city ever, Barov suddenly hesitated and asked, "Your Majesty, are you planning to send these people into the factory?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded. "Or the engineering team, the first army, the institute... as long as it is a place where people can be used." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that would most likely cause the Executive Office to fall into the trap of underfunding." The general manager hesitated, "The main income of the Executive Office today comes from the sale of chaotic drinks, perfumes, steam engines, etc. You know, the latter is achieved through the joint chamber of commerce, and the payment is about three to six months. The salaries of the people are fixed monthly, and the amount is almost 80,000 Jinlong. Now the former is much larger than the latter, and there is no need to worry about the stock of funds. However, after the number of people has doubled, the situation is different..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are worried about the event If there is an accident in the return of the goods, if there is a delay of several months, there will be no pay for the winter city. Roland picked up his eyebrows and was very interested. He was a man who had been an assistant for many years under the Finance Minister. He was so quick to associate economic issues with the population plan. This reaction really made him happy.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is exactly the case. Barry said while writing and writing on the book, "and the salary will continue to grow as the length of service increases. This part of the expenditure will only get higher and higher." However, the total output of Chaos beverages is so much, and the million-dollar plan will greatly reduce the purchasing power of the winter and the wolf heart. The future income will inevitably drop a lot. The two will come and go, the funds of the Executive Office reserve. I am afraid there will be very little left. I have slightly estimated that for every 100,000 people in a year, the risk will increase by 30%. Unless you can find new income points..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
