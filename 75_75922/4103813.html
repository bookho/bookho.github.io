			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is between the electric and the flint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone spear crossed a white shadow and walked straight through the chest of the bear species, even at a speed that could not be captured with the naked eye. If it is a spear within a visual distance, Luo Jia is not sure to be able to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil apparently noticed the giant wolf that suddenly rushed out of the grass, but it was impossible to make a parry or avoid the action at this time. Its right hand is still entangled with the bear species, the only thing that can be done - or the subconscious move is to lift the other hand in front of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This action saved its throat, but sent the entire left arm to the mouth of the three princesses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not hesitate, biting a band, the rich bloody smell suddenly poured into her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the madman is almost the same as the human being, compared to the thick-brown bear species - perhaps to be harder, but in front of the three-inch wolf, The muscles are as soft as the cloth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This touch makes Luo Jia's confidence increase! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is unharmed, and one of the enemies has lost her combat power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shot is undoubtedly an extremely successful raid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the mixed species of evil beasts fell, the devastated madman slammed back and stepped back a few steps, screaming angrily at her. Just without the left arm, the right arm is completely in a state of contraction. It is difficult to maintain the balance of the body, and its deterrence is greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction of the other devil made Luo Jia feel a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw that it quickly took a horn from his arms and put it on his lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜"——————"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thick voice broke the forest The silence, amazed a group of birds that inhabit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there other devils nearby? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that she has checked the area of ​​the film, and there is nothing else worth noting except the honeycomb and the nest that the lightning bolts are marked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia decided not to think too much, kill the guy who still has one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if they have reinforcements, they can only see the bodies of their companions when they arrive here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took two steps in two steps, and in the blink of an eye she rushed to the trumpet devil--the latter dropped the horn and pulled out the stone axe hanging around her waist. Head down to the wolf girl! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was half a year ago, Luojia would choose to avoid its edge and retreat to find opportunities, but experienced extraordinary witches, four-winged eagle and many mixed species. After the battle of the evil beast, her skills have made great progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three princesses dumped their bodies, unilaterally exerting their hands and feet, and smashed out at a nearly strange angle, and the body flew almost out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The axe naturally took a nap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is not a simple dodge, when the devil’s attention moves with her movements and is completely concentrated on her mouth and claws. The real attack came quietly - Luo Jia rolled the huge tail into a hook and swept it straight toward the back door of the devil. This attack fully borrowed the body's momentum, just like an invisible uppercut. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"砰!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a muffled sound, the unexpected devil was drawn. Going out, hitting a big tree heavily, the stone axe also flew to the side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Luo Jia was going to pursue the situation and give the enemy a fatal claw, suddenly there was a screaming scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She subconsciously felt bad, turned back and swept her paws, just in time with the rushing hand-to-hand madness. This palm was completely rounded. She could even feel the ribs of the other side slamming, and the whole chest was smashed for a few minutes. The claws penetrated the leather and penetrated into the devil's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a suicide attack, just as the other party deliberately uses the body to greet her giant palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought just flashed, and Luo Jia knew the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broken right arm of the broken hand madness, once again swelled up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it mean that it takes a little more than half an hour to recover? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia was shocked and wanted to get rid of his opponent, but his claws were hugged by the enemy, like being caught in a steel tongs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This posture, it’s hard to be...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is hoping to fly to the other tail The devil, a heart suddenly sinks to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the arm of the person who swells up, and even the bloody marks on the dry skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait...She suddenly remembered what Lightning said - in the hot air balloon encounter in the snowy mountains of the West, the madman did show a short time continuous vote The ability of the spear twice, but the second power will drop sharply, and the arm of the inlaid magic stone will be completely scrapped. It can be said that it is a kind of self-destructive play, which is not enough to fear - it is strange! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idiot was really killed by her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of death is endless, but at the time of life and death, it can cause great trouble to the opponent. In the Shamin, there is a saying that "the loser is not close" is the truth. They are no longer worried about their aftermath, and their final blow is bound to be extremely devastating! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil who grabbed her arm could not completely ban her actions. Only the supernatural can do this, but Luo Jia’s heart is clear, the other’s only purpose Just to make her movements slower, whether it is turning away or waiting for an opportunity to escape, can not survive in the next fatal blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the numbers, the arm of the madman has expanded to the limit, and the blue blood splatters from the cracked skin, as if it would explode at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took the last bone spear and aimed at the wolf girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can only gamble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia’s eyes wide open, staring at the enemy’s every move, for a moment, the world around him has become silent, only to hear his own heartbeat sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the madman shot, she cut off the magic in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the wolf is rapidly shrinking, and the original shackles of the locks suddenly appear large gaps. Not only that, but the behemoths that are almost indispensable for the spears also suddenly changed the outline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bone spear flying straight toward the head of the desert giant wolf penetrated the broken hand devil behind her, and the Noga has recovered. Human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gambled to win. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spearman obviously did not expect this step, it grabbed the arm that had been completely withered, squatting in place, until the three princesses walked in front of it, only opened mouth Spit two words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tower...Caf..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Luo Jia singled into a wolf claw, Milled its helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red fog is gone, the devil softly falls to the ground, no breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
