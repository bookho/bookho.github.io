			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s mood also surged with this sentence, originally intended to blame her should not take life adventure, look at her relaxed smile, words to the throat I swallowed again, and I didn’t know what to pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last he had to pat her back, "Don’t be so slammed next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The nightingale nodded first, then shook his head again, and the voice was so pressure that he could only hear it. "I don't like Anna, I can turn those drawings into reality... I can do it for you, only this." She paused for a little while, and then went on, "but please rest assured that being around is the most important thing, I will not easily put myself in danger."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This straightforward discourse made her cheeks turn a little bit red, and although it suddenly became ambiguous when it was halfway, Roland still heard it, it was a "you". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, probably exhausted all the courage, the nightingale pulled out of his arms and broke into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to imagine that this woman, who is obviously brave enough to say these words, can hold a musket and an explosive, and in the ruins alone, a pair of monsters with a horrible monster A duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but feel a bit of emotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For future security work, please continue to be served by me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the nightingale From behind, when she mentioned this, her tone suddenly became much more stable, and somehow, Roland gave birth to a long-lost feeling of peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a routine hug of other witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what made him feel a little uncomfortable was that the Tacitahs looked at his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the alliance members who are full of laughter and laughter, they still maintain the basic order after landing, and they are wearing black boxes under the leadership of the first few people. Cross the pier. But when they passed by Roland, their eyes were almost like nails on him. There was a burning sensation like a real thing. The eagerness and eagerness to try could make him shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is clear about the reason. It is nothing more than that Pasha and others have already told the news of the dream world to the goddess of witches on the front line of the snowy mountain. In addition to some of the results of the search, another point is to transport the soul instrument to the snowy mountains to complete the transfer of engulfing worms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that if all women’s burning eyes don’t make him so careful, most of them are male appearances. - After all, the source of the body limits their choices, and it is helpless to be attached to the male gods, but the feelings for Roland are very different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they know that their souls are still the heart of women, they will instinctively feel repelled if they are directly looked at by a group of tall and powerful "men". With a desire that is hard to suppress, the feeling is even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to wait until the end of the meeting, Roland just returned to the castle, and the nightingale shook his long legs again and appeared on his desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Those things that empty shells can enter the world of dreams...is it true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that it is not only the remnants of Tacila, but the news has also spread to other witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was initially surprised," Roland shrugged. "As long as they interrupt consciousness in the light column, they will appear in a dream--the light beam It is not so much a connection with the gods, but rather a transmission channel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night licked the mouth, but did not answer, the eyes were getting brighter Both feet are also on his knees. Obviously, her courage is much bigger without outsiders watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" Roland immediately vetoed, "I know what you are thinking, transforming yourself into a witch, and then entering a dream? I will not agree." You did this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike Anna, the nightingale is obviously easy to act on the move, and he has already learned this, so he noticed the other’s thoughts. He stopped her thoughts for the first time. If it is left, she may not do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
