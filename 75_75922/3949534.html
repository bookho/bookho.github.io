			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill stood behind his wife and smiled as she watched the goods in the booth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time, Irene’s eyes are always extraordinarily serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact... every piece of meat is counted by weight, which one is the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!" she refused. "You like to eat lean meat, but there is no fat, it is not enough to cook. A layer of fat is the best rib, sliced. Frying is also very suitable. You can't take it seriously."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling couldn’t help but laugh out, "Well, you pick it up here, I will go buy a bag of wheat first, and I have to queue up for a while. When you buy it, come over and look for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Ai Lynn did not return to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head helplessly and turned to the food stalls in the convenience market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the snow, the lord of the Lord has also erected a wooden shed around the market, and specially posted a notice announcing that even in the winter, here The sale will not be suspended. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that in the long month of the demon, the town will still provide a stable food supply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the townspeople, this move is undoubtedly a powerful peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people selling food is much higher than the meat stalls that are less visited. There was a long queue in front of the counter, and two patrols in black uniforms were maintaining order. But in the town, they have a completely different name: the police. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the fascinating innovations of the lords, dawn dawn is no stranger, it is not unusual to change the name. And he also knows that the patrols give the impression of the majority of the civilians the same as the rogue, and changing the name does make people feel different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Sylter, good afternoon," someone in the team recognized him. "You also come to buy wheat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Send me here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My location is for you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no," Ferien waved his hand and stood at the end of the team. "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can really Welcome," the middle-aged man in front of him laughed. "It’s the first Cavaliers in the West."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling slightly, "You know that I used to... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, of course, this is not a secret in Bianbu Town," the other party touched his chin and said, "My son and daughter like it very much." You, since inquiring about your origins, the older son Nat is still clamoring to be a knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's all in the past, He shook his head. "And the Highness no longer needs a knight." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have the first army," the middle-aged man did not think. "I have not dared to talk to you before I changed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s true that when you were a Duke’s knight, most of the civilians didn’t even dare to look directly at themselves, and there was envy and admiration in the words behind the discussion, but more fear . I dare to look at myself with my eyes, and I don’t care about my blunt words. Only Irene is the first to see the theater, so that his heart can find a home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being captured and captured in Bianbu Town, Feilin thought that he was only playing for a lord, but he did not expect to become a teacher to learn. Teacher, and also gained the respect of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of respect is completely different from the feeling of the Cavaliers. You will not avoid and stay away from him, but hope to be closer to him than to keep it. The homage to the distance will make the film feel warmer and more satisfying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting for more than a moment, it is equal to the film of the film. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Identity card." The teller said, followed by a glimpse, "Ferlin teacher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Betty," he was a little surprised. The girl standing behind the counter was the first graduate of his class. Immediately, Feilin quickly understood and said with pleasure, "Are you entering the city hall?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," she showed a happy expression on her face, just like in the college. When I nodded, I said, "I am now an apprentice in the ruling department. I am currently working in the Ministry of Agriculture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling does not want to wait for the people behind, On my ID card and six silver wolves, "I bought a medium bag of wheat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay!" She registered her name on the book. Going back and shouting, a porter was taken out of the storeroom and a bag of wheat was placed on the counter. It can't be inspected here, nor is it accepted. Every bag is already packed. It is divided into three types according to the weight. The small bag is enough for two people to eat for one month. The food price is fixed and there is almost no floating. The ID card must be presented at the time of purchase, and the purchase amount is limited. Film understands that this measure is obviously to prevent people from buying large quantities of food, resulting in the fact that civilians in real need have no food to buy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, I have time to sit at my house." Betty handed back the ID card to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Feilin smiled and took the wheat bag and walked aside to let the position out. Until then, Irene was still missing, and probably looked at other goods. He simply found a striking and dry place, put the bag on the floor, and sat down for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he flashed a blue figure in front of his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When dawn dawned on the light, I couldn’t help but look down and then trembled – it was a beautiful woman with a delicate face and a rare blue hair. It belongs to the type that you will never forget when you look at it. Film felt that the blood in the whole body had almost solidified, not because the other person's appearance was outstanding, but... he had seen this honor in the family hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he was a child, he asked more than once, the portrait of the first person hanging on the wall in the hall, but his father kept silent. She is undoubtedly a woman, but she is more advanced than all her grandfather's portraits. Only after a drunkenness, he listened to his father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you remember correctly, the person in the painting is the creator of the Celtic family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...how is it possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, waited a long time," Irene’s voice pulled him back from the confused thoughts. "I later picked some eggs and bought them." A small bag of butter. Is your wheat bought?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." Film was absent-minded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got home, he was still in the picture, the woman’s figure lingering... Why would I be in Bianbu Town and see West? The ancestor of the family? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After hesitating for a long time, he decided to go back to the long song fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the film told Irene about this intention, the latter raised a brow. "Are you not already severing with the family? Why go back?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...because," he hesitated, "because of something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Inheritance?" Irene snarled. "Is it wrong? Is it for... woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," said the film, "How is it possible!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But your eyes tell me that you are lying," she pressed the dawn light on the chair and looked at him condescendingly. "You promised to do it." My knight, I also believe that you will not break your promise, so I feel extraordinarily curious... And what can't I tell you? Before the farm house on the outskirts of the Long Song Fortress, we agreed. Nothing should be hidden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
