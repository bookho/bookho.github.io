			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lily wrapped her towel around her wet head and returned to the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have previously accused the prince of pursuing pleasure, I have to say that the bathroom is really... great. Under the shower, enjoy the cold well water rushing to the body, sweeping away the sultry and sticky feeling brought by the hot sun, and the body seems to be reborn after a busy day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after a shower, she felt a bit guilty. When I didn’t hold back that day, I screamed quickly. Should I apologize to my Highness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Treason!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啥?" Lily picked up the silk that stuck to her forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You clearly say that you don't believe in the theory of small balls, but now you have advanced your ability." Mystery Moon sits on the bed, his upper body stands upright and his fingers are pointing. She, "You are a big liar!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lily rolled her eyes. "I don't believe it now, everything is made up of small balls...how is it possible? Well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can say that your magic is condensed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The ball has nothing to do," she shrugged and climbed onto the bed to press the hand of the mysterious moon. "His Highness said that evolution does not have to accept the theory of small balls. As long as you can understand your abilities in depth, you can make the magic change." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Mystery Month groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said so anyway."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystery Month is not at the time of the Aid Attention, she has always lacked self-confidence, Lily thought. Unlike yourself, food preservation is a very important ability for a food aid shortage. And she can understand the feelings of the other side, because after coming to Bianbu Town, his ability has become a chicken rib, completely out of use. She was also afraid of being kicked out of the town, but the result was contrary to her fears. Although the prince did not send her extra tasks, her attitude towards her was not much different from other witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be the reason why the mystery has become more daring before the change of the mystery, and her fears are shrinking because Hakhara has never been She was watching her and even forbidding her to use her ability in the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That..." Mystery Month frowned. "How can I understand my ability? Your Highness says that the magnetic field is invisible, intangible, and the microscope is not Use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't ask me, I don't understand," Lily yawned. "In fact, I only know that my ability is long. The cells, bacteria, and fungi that my Highness said... I can’t understand it. He also said that he would write a textbook for me,” she said helplessly. “Forgive me, I don’t even know the words. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I also want to be more powerful," Mystery Moon rolled over the bed. "I want to do more for my Highness!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lily sighed, Ming is older than herself, but she is still younger than herself, really..."You ask Anna Sister."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ask her?" The roll suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, you are not afraid of delaying your time, then ask Anna sister." Lily said, "The whole town is in addition to His Royal Highness. Only she knows the most."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Anna is also very busy, I heard that the machines in the town are all made by her," Hesitant Hesitant Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you can ask for free time to ask her, such as after dinner, such as asking her to help to heat the bath water, or simply invite her to take a bath, not Have a lot of time to ask?" The little girl made a plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What you said... seems to make sense," her eyes lit up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then sleep, get up early tomorrow." Lily solved the towel on the beginning, and finally wiped two, one fell on the pillow. "You go to blow the candles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day Lily did not go to the kitchen or wheat warehouse to practice her ability as usual, but sat down at the table and began to learn to use the microscope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new task for the placement of His Royal Highness - before the arrival of the textbook, fully understand the types and shapes of various cells and fungi, and record their differences. . It doesn't matter if you can't write, just use the painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And listening to His Royal Highness, Anna is still experimenting with a microscope with a higher magnification. If she can achieve a magnification of four hundred times, she can see a smaller Microbes - bacteria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of future exercises is naturally no longer a preservation, but an attempt to diversify the use of the parent and the copy. Lily felt a little difficult to understand at this point. Fortunately, His Highness proposed several practice directions, such as ordering them to simulate the appearance of a single cell, or using consciousness to destroy or modify cells. Of course, these must be based on a full understanding of all kinds of subtle life, although Lily does not know if she can do that step, but always have to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, exploring the unknown world itself is a very interesting thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At night, the mystery moon came back with frustration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" she curiously asked, "What does Anna sister say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She said a lot," the mystery moon fell on the bed. "I can't understand a word. She said that the magnetic field is everywhere. The compass can indicate the direction because we are in a huge magnetic field. Is this not?" Explain that my ability is not useful at all. Not to mention the principle of the magnetic field, what kind of moving charged ball and magnetic force are interdependent, the magnetic field can also produce current... Sure enough, if you don’t understand the ball theory, you can’t improve?” She whispered. "You said, am I too stupid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slightly." Lily helped the forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Treason!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Another sister in the Witch Alliance has acquired new abilities, which makes Wendy very happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lily’s evolution has made other witches’ enthusiasm to learn. After the evening’s class, some people continue to entangle their books and ask questions. After growing up in their own abilities, they all honestly squatted on the chandelier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for only one person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she returned to the room with the "Basic Theory of Natural Science", the nightingale was sitting at the table, concentrating on what to organize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter knows that it must have nothing to do with learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?" she asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Divided fish slices, do you want to eat?" At night, a piece of dried fish was smeared, ambiguous, "just brought from the kitchen." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So much?" Wendy looked at the golden dried fish on the table in amazement, and the rich honey scent came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the chef saw me coming every day, just baked all the rest, anyway, this thing can be put for a long time." She took out a small bag and put it Put a meal into it. There are five or six identical bags at the table, each of which is tamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty suddenly understood what she was doing - it was preparing for dry food. Whenever the co-help club is ready to leave the town, it is necessary to divide the dry food into small quantities and pack it into the carry-on bag. No matter how hungry you are on the road, you can only eat the prescribed amount, so as not to use enough food. Since coming to Bianbu Town, there has been a steady supply of three meals plus regular afternoon tea, so no sisters have ever done this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, for the nightingale, it is better to prepare snacks than to prepare dry food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't read books?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Anyway, I don't understand, just hear those The theory and theorem are dizzy," the nightingale swallowed the fish and laughed. "And my ability is enough. It doesn't matter if I don't evolve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
