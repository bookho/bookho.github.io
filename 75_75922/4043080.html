			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, are you okay?" Joel pushed the other seven feet to push the seventy-sixth, which never responded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed, moved his body, put it with her, and then bit the coat that fell on the ground and covered it on both. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think about it, so I will sleep for one night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After such a setback, he found himself unexpectedly calm, underground auctions, big money, everyone’s attention, witch night attack... just a night, he I have experienced the feelings I have not tasted in the past twenty years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this thrilling feeling is not as bad as you think? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if you let Joel come once, he will never agree again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was almost no sleep all night, and the people who stumbled to the show found the two of them at noon the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment was soon transferred to a spacious and comfortable big house, not only the servants who sent soft bread and freshly squeezed juice, but also the maid. He checked the whole body up and down for him, and didn't even let go between his legs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also at his request, Otto Rossi, who had been waiting anxiously outside, was also taken into the cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Upon seeing the ambassador, Otto couldn’t wait to ask, "I heard that you were injured?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go ahead," after the servant sent by the "black money", he completely described the passage of the matter. "You have made me miserable, it is bad." Well, I can hardly keep my life. Fortunately, the other side sees my heart and kindness, and I don’t have any death to pay attention to the auction witch. If I change someone else, I must have become a cold body. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; complaining that he has been in the gray castle for many years, and even if he can't find any practical benefits, he can at least earn some embarrassment or sympathy. Maybe it will be used. And looking at Otto's appearance, certainly not indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fruit then appears very uneasy. "This is my negligence. After I go back, I will give you some compensation."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The four thousand gold dragons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The witch is escaped from your room and belongs to the jurisdiction of "black money" They should not deduct this auction fee. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you not saving a big sum?" "Yu said, "I saved the witch and did not waste the black letter." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every time the black letter will be re-made, so it is not a waste," Otto smiled helplessly. "But Golden Dragon is really Saved. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe suddenly remembered what he said on the 76th in his ear.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You only need to pay 500 gold dragons to the black money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, would you like to buy me?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to four thousand, five hundred has become a less exaggerated number, maybe he can let Otto generously donate once? It is a good compensation for this shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Joel cleared his throat and prepared to open his mouth, the bedroom door was pushed open, and a man with a silver mask was accompanied by two attendants. Going down and coming in. It can be seen that his age is quite large. The dark brown hair is covered with a lot of silver silk, wearing a loose silk robes, and the black dragon head symbol on the chest is particularly eye-catching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the person in charge of the exhibition, you can call me a silver face," he said slightly. "Black money" shows your experience. Apologetic, fortunately, you were not injured in the accident. We have already investigated the witch's escape and will inform you as soon as there is news. The auction amount will not be deducted from the black letter unless we can catch the witch and you still need her at that time. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
