			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto Losey returned home and locked his head in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t understand why things are going to happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the King’s illness, Anpein seems to have been hit hard, and it’s hard to recover in recent days, and acting is not the same as before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accurately, he became strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a friend from childhood to big, Otto thinks he knows the prince very well, and Anpein is not the kind of person who is unscrupulous for power, and sometimes he will I feel that the other side is a little childish and not suitable to be a king who dominates the overall situation. Because of this, he intends to wait for Anpein to be a queen, and with Belinda and Oro to help his friends to govern the government - the three have always followed the king, from the beginning of the establishment of the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he still answered without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Otto found that Anpein didn't care about his answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party asks only for a habit of uneasiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I have not considered this point myself - the three are indeed willing to support the royal family of Moya, but if His Royal Highness does not need their support? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that he realizes this, he feels that Ampe is farther away from himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto took a strong breath, maybe he should take the initiative to do something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condition of His Majesty the King, whether it is a pharmacist or an alchemist, is helpless. He is also ignorant of the treatment of diseases, and there is no way to fundamentally solve the heart disease of Ampein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care the prince to cheer up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing he has done enough, but it turns out to be useless, probably by his own, there is no way to pull the temple back to the side . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three must unite, and only by working together, may find out why Anpein did this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of it, he stood up and walked out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Young Master, it is already late, where are you going?" When the hall passed, the butler came up and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tokat House, not coming back tonight!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light car is familiar to the Tokat family territory. Because the two are very familiar, no one in the great Earl House has blocked him. Otto went straight into the training room, and found out that he was attending with the attendant. Pair of Oro Tokat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, how come you are," Oro took off the sweaty headscarf and threw the wooden sword to the attendant. "I don't dare to go to the fun." Going into the door, so I decided to pull me into the water?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have something to say to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took Oro to the next room and told his thoughts and plans. "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Find out the Ampere change What is the reason for the strangeness?" The latter grinned. "Sorry, I am not interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you-"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is the prince, the successor of the morning kingdom, will not always be our friend, do you understand?" Oro shook his head. "And Ampein is also twenty years old. Not a child of seven or eight years old, he is awkward, we have to follow up to marry him? If you don't want to say it, don't say it, I don't want to go and ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Don't you plan to assist Anpein Momo? Are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he see this too? Otto’s heart glimpsed, “But the three of us have always followed Moya—”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Three?” Oro smiled disapprovingly, “Since Ann After Delia’s death, there was only you and me.” He turned and walked out with his hands. “Since you are here, I will take you to the “Dream of Dreams”, or I will always worry. I am worried about this, I feel tired when I look at it, and it’s okay to vent my energy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Andrea did not die. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oro's footsteps stopped instantly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, Otto whispered in his heart Tao, saying that I want to keep this secret, I have not been able to keep the contract.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andreia Quinn is not dead," he repeated. "I saw her in Bianbu Town, Grey Fort. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oro instantly turned and rushed to him, and the strength almost didn't push him to the wall.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say, what? This, is this true? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw it with my own eyes, she was with Roland Wimbledon. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Together..." Oro widened his eyes. "Do you mean the kind of relationship between men and women?" "I don't know," Otto bit his lip. "But she became a witch. The entire Grey Fort is also only Roland's willingness to take in the witch." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, witch? He said in a different way, "What happened at the time?" "Otto Losey slowly confessed Andrea's experience and looked at the other side's mixed feelings. He felt a retaliatory resentment in his heart." The pleasure of who asked you to immediately believe in the story of Quinn’s cliff, and now that she is not dead and late, she will not be with me, nor will I be with you.<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out that her father made the cliff accident for this purpose..." After listening to Oro, he sat down on the floor and his face was frustrated. "Damn, how can I?" Didn't think about taking a look at the grave? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy... is too much! "Cough, so we need to pull back the Anpein Hall." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person turned a blind eye, "Ah? What is the relationship between the two? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course! If you think about it, he puts the covenant between the two countries on hold, and he is unwilling to give reasons. In the end, he will only let the co-defense plan that the King has set down to fail. Once the church launches an attack, we can only resist it alone - if they advanced the morning, you will lead the Knights to face it, right? Asked Otto.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, this is my duty." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then you defeated and sacrificed, wouldn't you see Andrea? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, it seems to make sense - not right, how do you feel that I will lose?" "Oro is not convinced."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The kingdom of the fierce and fierce wolf kingdom has not been able to recover the defeat, and you can go wherever you go," he ignored. The protests of the friends, then went on, "In turn, the church is going to attack the gray assault, and Roland always has to meet the invaders?" If he dies, Andrea's ten ** will also die next to him. If he is caught by the church, the end will only be worse. But if the two countries can make a difference between each other, so that the church does not dare to move, you do not have to die on the battlefield. In the future, there will be opportunities for reunion. Do you say that the covenant is not important? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Important. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't pull the hall back, there is no covenant. Do you think it has anything to do with it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's related. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you can't do it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oro 斩 截 地 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
