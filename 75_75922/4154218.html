			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Women's Snail Project" was opened for a few days, and the professionalism demonstrated by the participants made Roland stunned, and what surprised him was that everyone was full. Energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disputes and debates continued throughout the meeting, and the time often went from 9:00 am to 7:00 pm. When it was difficult to determine the problem, it was noisy. Two points are not unusual. Although most people are dressed in formal attire, they are in the technical field, and they are not as hot as the shirtless. Not only the industry backbone of the 30s and 40s, but even the old-aged ones with gray hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average person has reached this age, the articulation, the slow thinking is the normal state, but in their body, except the appearance, they can hardly see the old state, the voice is clear and bright. It is said that the eyes are even more devoid of the gods, and often debate the problem with the late ones. This made Roland believe that the organ of the brain is indeed more and more developed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dream world, he can still rely on the power of awakening to maintain a highly concentrated spirit, but when he wakes up, he will obviously feel tired and tired. In order to deal with the content of the meeting, he had to increase the number of sleeps and replenish his energy with real time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the atmosphere in the project department is not the same from the beginning. At least initially, everyone did not show much interest, and the focus of the dispute was more focused on Roland's "settings." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, another type of "competitor" formed by the degeneration of human demons after the destruction of human civilization, and black fires and elements that are obviously inconsistent with the overall technical level Purification and other natural power variants... Although there is no one in the leadership of the martial arts association and the government, no one is openly questioning whether this is possible, but the emotions of resistance and coping have always appeared, not to remain silent, or to In order to facilitate the work, the details are repeatedly asked, and the tone used in this process will naturally not be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Roland’s many rounds of eyes to Ling and others, I’m afraid the Taqila witch would start on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contradiction between the two sides reached its peak until the first day of the night summary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief of a mechanical control related department stood out and said that even if there was more discussion, it would be useless to remember. It’s enough for the martial arts to digest for a few weeks, and it’s better to dissipate it earlier. Roland clearly remembered that the book that had been silent was suddenly shot on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next meeting room is completely the stage of her personal domination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only the content of the discussion, but who opened a few times, questioned a few words from beginning to end, and how much contributed to the project All listed one by one. This incredible super memory ability suddenly shocked everyone present, and the chief of the objection was even speechless. For a moment, it seems that everyone in the room has become a student, and the book is the only teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably she has confirmed the association’s inference that “the power of nature does have infinite possibilities, not just strengthening the muscles of the limbs”, or perhaps the engineering elites The natural closeness of the high-intellectual person, coupled with the outstanding temperament and appearance of the book itself, was suddenly reversed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, disputes still occur from time to time, but the focus of discussion has shifted from the setting part to the female snail project itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, in the absence of money and no shortage of people, every "controversy" in the meeting can be immediately conveyed to the R&D team. The physical test was conducted the first time to verify its feasibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly the biggest day in the dream for Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the advice of Chief Technology Officer Wu, the current focus of his improvement should be on the “tools”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party’s original words are: “There are high-precision processing methods and reliable metal materials, but still use such a simple machine tool. It is really a Waste. Even if there is no electronic control technology, you can use mechanical means to achieve semi-automatic precise control. If you come up early, you will not endure these defective products until now."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Roland laughs and laughs, the "defective product" in the other party's mouth is the peak of his design, but he also fully agrees with the dean's evaluation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
