			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neutron source can be understood as a catalyst for fission. With the extra neutrons it provides, even uranium 235 below the critical mass can be efficiently split. . <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, the strontium and radium separated from the uranium mine can form a neutron source with strontium. There is no technical problem, and it is purely utilized. When you are bombarded with alpha particles, you will release a lot of neutrons. It really works as long as you get together. All three are naturally occurring substances, and their feasibility is undoubtedly much higher than those of artificial elements that are extremely difficult to serve or require complex processes to produce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Roland’s final choice of 钋 instead of radium, purely for safety reasons – 半210’s half-life is short, but it’s basically alpha decay, gamma photons. The output is extremely low. In other words, as long as it does not eat, it is almost as safe as uranium. Radium is different, whether it is the subsequent decay of the suffocating gas or the gamma photon emitted by itself, it is a safety hazard that cannot be ignored. In order to avoid accidents during the experiment, the 钋-铍 neutron source became the most suitable choice. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the 铍 element also has the property of reflecting neutrons. If it is used as a shell, it can further increase the efficiency of neutron utilization. If you use both at the same time, plus a sufficient amount of uranium 235, even the most simple and reliable gun-type structure can achieve good results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 铍 is widely found in emeralds, so the distinctive minerals do not save the effort to find water in the Ajima Mountain, as long as the news is released through the merchant channel, Wide-ranging acquisitions within the four kingdoms will do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is well aware of the extent to which the technical level of No Winter City is - the principle of radioactivity is simple, but the utilization rate per 10% is a threshold. From 1% to over 90%, there is no need for massive theoretical calculations and experimental corrections. If the high-efficiency release energy is not achieved, it will not be possible to miniaturize the weapons, and it will also waste the weapon-grade uranium that is hard to accumulate. . Without Lucia, the loss of refining is an insurmountable peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the same way, the handcuffs are not just a joke in the case of loss or no loss. The technical thresholds vary widely, but the principle is consistent. Thanks to the inherent advantages of chemical energy conversion to chemical gunpowder, even if only 1% of uranium participates in fission, its power is enough to reverse the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of this battle for life and death that determines the fate of the community, he will do his best. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, isn't it a romance to steal the fire in such a wild era and bring people closer to the sun? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as there is a chance, he is willing to give it a try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, just keep it," Roland patted Lucia's head. "When all the lead cabinets are full, you can start officially." Experimented."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty!" Lucia was very energetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp At the same time, there is no winter city, the empty knight college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece is located in the west of the new institute and is also quiet in a huge area - today is the day of the student’s vacation, most people leave the hospital early District, enjoy the time of reunion with family, and Goode is an exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Upward, pressure bar!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Skywind, roll!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat on the simulated bridge while setting the wind direction for himself, while responding to the regulations in the Flight Manual, the wood rods screamed. The bite is like an old, unwashed waterwheel. The temperature in the training room was quite stuffy. After a long practice, the back of his body was soaked with sweat, and the chin was dripping from time to time, and it was scattered on the simple "dashboard". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the grip slipped, Goode stopped moving and leaned back into the chair to breathe a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly half a year of study, he is not the first out-of-the-box layman. The "Flight Manual" written by His Royal Highness Princess does not say that it is backwards. The basic operation can be said to be all printed. In my mind. From the very beginning, when I boarded the bridge, I was so busy that I could use my password to close the eyes. If I ordered myself, I didn’t even have to say anything. As long as I had a thought, my body would react in the first place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how you imagine, he can't outline the wind in the brain. "Capturing the flow and size of the wind, feeling the posture and tremor of the body, and then applying the coordinated operation." This is the original words in the manual, but he does not know what it feels like. Whether it is pulling half or pulling the bottom, the bridge will not give him any feedback. As for the "dashboard" drawn with ink lines, it is more like laughing at his efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more skilled the action is, the more frustrated the old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he was upset, the door of the training room suddenly slammed open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really are here-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How, I guess it's right. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode went back and looked at the two people who accidentally looked into the room - they were the same team of Finchem and Heinz "How are you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't take advantage of vacations to find fun?" Fingin whistled. "Because the fun is in college." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's you, no family, you don't know if you have a lovely sister?" Heinz stepped forward and hooked his neck. "She also told me not to be tired, oh... really good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode suddenly looked tight, "Wait, you two Going to the place where I live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Crap, or where are we going to find you?" Finchem raised an eyebrow at him. "She is called Rachel. , how about introducing us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking I think, "Goode back to stare at each other one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that we are not in sufficient condition," Finchem disagreed. "At least I have a formal residence in Chishuihe Community!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode was silent for a moment, and finally shook his head helplessly. "It has nothing to do with you, but my sister... Rachel her own problem. You won't want to She is together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why? I think she is pretty good," Heinz did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking to listen?" Finkin also looked curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't ask this," Goode didn't have a good air. "Say something else - what did you mean before, what do you mean?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fingin did not continue to entangle, he lowered his voice, God said mysteriously, "Do you want to try a real plane?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode couldn’t help but hold, "What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw it when I climbed the wall a few days ago. "Finkin showed a slightly smug smile. "There were several new planes in the flight yard. Although they were covered with cloth, they were similar in size to the unicorn driven by His Royal Highness. That is to say, that is the plane prepared for us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A few days ago? Why didn't you say that at the time?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "I am not afraid that you are over-excited and leaked the news." He shrugged. "And today is a holiday, there are only a few people in the college, just sneak in and see what it really is." of "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are crazy!" Goode didn't dare to set the channel. "Without permission, we can't enter the flight field at will!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The soldiers won't let you in." Finchem glanced at him. "Of course, it's a different path, and it doesn't go through the flight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just go and have a look," Heinz also helped "You should feel it. Your wife, Tilly's recent smile, is a lot less, and the training is strict. If you go on like this, you may have to wait a month or two to really touch it. Compared to this simple Wood table, don't you want to see in advance what exactly is the plane we are going to drive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
