			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, call, call... finally... arrived." When the little waterhole when he came again appeared in front of the two, Sinbad felt full They are lax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the Three Gods, thanking the Son of the Earth and the Mother of the Sea, he recited in his heart. The hole in the moment is already bright, which allows the two to escape at the fastest speed. At the same time, the closer to the sea, the greater the shrinkage of the cave. Just like a canopy, it is probably the reason why the armored giant python does not catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean complete security. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t forget the tidal crawling sound – he wouldn’t be surprised even if the desert of the endless cape was concentrated here. Sinbad only knows that these predators are likely to cross the stone wall at any time and follow the smell to tear them into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the donkeys can't swim, and as long as they escape into the sea, they can get out of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quickly, wear a helmet!" Sinbad grabbed the diving helmet on the ground and couldn't wait to cover his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he found that the fjords did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what are you doing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... let's go first Rex turned his back to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go first? Sinbaddi stunned, damn, this guy will not be thinking about those luminescent relics? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but rush into his heart, stepping forward in three steps and stepping over the other’s shoulder. “Are you crazy? What is the situation now?""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About half of the words suddenly stalked in the throat, Sinbad surprised to look at Rex's chest - only see The clothes made of soft leather and the intestines were cut through a hole, and some blood was stained on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your diving suit..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Broken." Rex forcibly Opening the corner of the mouth reveals a smile that is more ugly than crying. "The last desert is not tied to me, but its pliers are rubbed into the clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand The silence of the people, the other side of the chest is not a big wound, just scratched the skin, the diving suit is broken, meaning that the sea will be poured into his helmet along the neck interface. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Simbadi said, "If you only use the gas pipe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Rex shook his head with a wry smile. "Unless we are close to the water, the strength of your inhalation is as big as the pump."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The two pipes are connected together to maintain balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point has already told him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before he answered his question, the other person would be so hesitant...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bayers realized their situation at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex untied his pocket and handed it to him. "This is a stone sample. Please give it to my assistant and say that I have found it." Not less than the discovery of Thunder adults."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddi noticed that his fingers were shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your assistant...and spare diving suits?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only this Two pieces - from selection to sewing, it takes at least half a year to make a suit." Rex took a deep breath - he could see that he was restrained by his emotions. "I know what you are thinking, In fact, all the way, I thought about all the way I could think. The result is that without diving suits, it is impossible to go out of the cave. Probably, this is fate..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The stranger...can't be a real explorer." He bit his lip. "You haven't come yet, you just have to go! As long as you can bring the news back, I can't even get the explorer." The title, the name will certainly spread throughout the fjord with this invention -!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddi looked at the water pool for a moment, only then Slowly said, "I refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Rex dared to widen his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still owe me twenty-nine golden dragons. If you die, I ask who is going to?" He didn't have a good air. "This agreement is only You and I and Muli know that I don't think your assistant will pay the money - as you can see from their wear, the two are better than the sand people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We just don't have money now!" Rex protested. "For the sake of buying a steam engine from the Grey Fort... it took a little more than expected... Wait until the reputation of the diving suit spread. There will inevitably be a large number of chambers of commerce to buy, and there is no need to worry about money at all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the problem is that the money has nothing to do with me, maybe even It won't be related to you either.” Simbadi threw the pockets and the helmet on the floor. “Do you think that if you become the scorpion's droppings, will those outsiders insist that the diving suit is your invention? If you change your rhetoric a little, you will be able to gain both fame and fortune. There is nothing more cost-effective than this. So not only me. Twenty-nine gold dragons will be lost in vain, and your wishes may or may not be realized."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What do you want to do?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Accepting the unknown, overcoming the self."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddi’s heart meditation after a long, vomiting "Mo Jin people don't like to be owed, nor do they like to lose faith in people. The agreement is an agreement, whether the other party is the king of the gray castle or the fjord - I promised to help the end, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex couldn’t help but hold it, "How can you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at the pool, He took off his waterproof suit. "Did you find that it is getting smaller?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex noticed that there was a scene around the pool. The wet bluestone, which is proof that the water surface is falling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The vortex sea has entered a period of low tide, that is, the distance we need to wading is getting shorter," Sinbad said word by word, "if If all goes well, we can be rescued by floating ten meters after swimming out of the water hole. It is impossible to do this in diving suits, but there is a chance to remove all the light - including the stones you collected. Now, take off your clothes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take off, undress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I want to stay in the tide It may be low, we must be prepared to stop the desert, and the most effective way is to arson.” Simbadi nodded. “But the water vapor is full, the flowers are not easy to ignite, so they need to be ignited.” He pointed Refers to the oil lamp, "grease plus leather, should be able to burn the fire for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex is silent for a long time, "...don't try, no May be successful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "You can't judge when the tide will fall back to the lowest point. Every hour above the sea, the distance through the water hole will increase several times. The rash action will only exhaust all the air in the long water hole." He said with pain, "And the most important thing is that I can't swim at all! It's ridiculous, it's a fjord. It's better than seasickness even if it is seasick! It's because I can't swim, I only I can't devote myself to the sea like other people and become a real explorer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have already seen it, when diving." Simba Di calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up and down by the basket, walking on the bottom of the sea is awkward No, without this bundle, you might not even be able to get water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you know, you still want to swim out?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
