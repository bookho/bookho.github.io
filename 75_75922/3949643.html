			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper layer of the sacred temple is brightly lit, and dozens of glowing magic stones shine the white library at the top of the tower like a white, staying in this hall. It's hard to imagine yourself being under the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed to the Hermes Cathedral on the ground, this is equivalent to the Tongtian Tower, which is also the favorite location of Jieluo. Through the window, she can easily overlook the whole picture of the secluded area. Looking at the image of a busy bud around the sacred stone pillar, her heart has a feeling of controlling the sentient beings - as if she is the god of the glory of the gods, and the feet are slowly moving forward in the darkness. People are believers who build the kingdom of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever she is free, she will take a book from the bookshelf that records the history and secrets of the federation, sitting slowly by the window Look through it, of course, and put a cup of black tea with a little winter flower on hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become a pope, Jielu is relaxed, and she is not nervous about the battle of the gods that are getting closer and closer. Instead, she has a little more expectation. Two hundred years of life made her feel boring, and the invincible devil in the record seems to be an opponent that is enough to make her feel excited. I don't know if these enemies can behave as fearless and terrible as they are when they are drawn into the soul battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s only a few years before this final battle, she needs to erect a new goal to spend the rest of her time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few people who can enter the eyes of Jieluo, and Roland Wimbledon happens to be one...and the only mortal who can be of interest to her now. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not be optimistic about anyone, but stand out from the battle for the king, to fight against the two pieces with the succession trend and not to fall, it must be said that it is commendable . And she found some interesting clues in the memory of Garcia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, the Queen of Waters used the maid who was placed next to the four princes to let him take the deadly alchemy poison, but the result was useless, and the angry queen Then the unlucky alchemist was executed - but Jielu asked the sect to copy a poison according to the recipe in memory, and found that the finished product was indeed as the alchemist claimed: colorless, tasteless, watered, and suffocated No medicine can be saved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is the maid deceived Garcia, or is it now that Roland Wimbledon is not the fourth prince? According to the information collected at hand, Jielu prefers the latter. The question is... if he is no longer a four prince, who is he? Why is there no one around me asking this question? The more interesting it is to pay attention to this aspect, the gradual change of style, the unanimous love of the people, and the change of the distribution of power in the West by its own power, whether it is the Church Messenger or the madman, it is gone forever... It is a pity that a person is only the lord of a small land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, Roland Wimbledon must be placed under the church, or to be a part of himself. Jielu couldn't help but lick her lips, which is why she is determined to turn the offensive direction - if it is as she thinks, then the benefits of giving priority to the gray castle may be far more than expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, as the lord of the powerful power, he must be in the back when fighting, how to force him out is also a problem to be considered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Jieluo thought about how to bypass the frontal battlefield and face Roland, the library door was pushed open and Isabella came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The meeting is over?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," she said, rubbing her neck, " You are good, sitting here every day reading a book and drinking tea, and I have to accompany the old guys... No, it’s an old guy and two little madmen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's not a nonsense, it's about the operation of the lower layers of the church," Jielu shrugged. "Although the witch is the body of the church, without them, we can't easily concentrate so much resources to achieve the ultimate." "The goal is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right," Isabella yawned. "I listened to them anyway, I want to transfer the preparations for the attack." Going to the Grey Fort, at least until the second month of summer, this is still an optimistic estimate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is neither too long nor short, clean Luo thought, waiting is both a kind of suffering, but also a nectar that increases the harvest and happiness. “What about the manufacture of pills?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
