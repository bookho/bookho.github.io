			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha was a moment, she did not expect the other party to have a flying magic stone, and has already figured out its usage. After hesitating for a while, she began to say, "We just understand the relationship between magic and the magic stone, but we can't make the magic stone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't make? "Tilly is awkward, "What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These magic stones are made by the devil..." She sighed. "If we can Get a stable source of magic stone, turn the auxiliary witch into a fighting witch, and there will be no God penalty plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil made?" Witch They could not help but show a surprised look, only Roland's face sank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How much do you know about the creation of the stone?" he asked, "How are these stones made?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of the two inquiries is somewhat blunt, and Ai Gesha does not want to answer, but considering that the devil is the ultimate enemy of the witch, these news will be said sooner or later, so I have to lie in my heart. A few words of the other person's rudeness, slowly replied: "There are a strange individual in the devil's group. We call it a chaotic beast. The shape looks like a huge flower bud. When standing up, it is almost three or four people high. There are tentacles that can crawl slowly. After it has swallowed the stone of the gods, it can produce all kinds of magic stones. According to the type of stone, the conversion speed is not the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"These...have you seen it with your own eyes?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have caught a living," she was very dissatisfied with the prince’s doubts. "The Holy Blessings raided a devil camp away from the battlefield, where exactly one chaotic beast is producing. Light magic stone. The witches brought it back to Takira and made it work for the holy city. The IQ of this kind of devil is extremely low. As long as the stone is continuously fed, it will transform itself. Unfortunately, we don’t know how to make it It produces higher magic stones and does not understand how to raise it. After half a year, it is like a broken plant, the whole body is yellow, withered and dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;" Later, the Detective Association sent several witches to other devil camps to conduct explorations. The information brought back confirmed this point - the Chaos Beast is the only way to get the magic stone, the more powerful the stone, the transformation The slower the speed, and most of the devils will use the magic stone to fight, such as the madness, which is to embed the magic stone that can instantly stimulate the body's strength on the arm, so that they have a powerful long-range attack ability. Stones are all seized from the enemy or in the camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So this flying magic stone originally belonged to a devil?" Tilly was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As far as I know, only a powerful demon leader can have such a magic stone," Aegusa sighed. "It should belong to a certain extraordinary." The spoils above."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the type of magic stone?" Roland frowned. "Do they have magic stones of all abilities at the beginning?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, if you said that humans should have finished," she rolled her eyes. "In the first battle of the gods Most of the devils don't wear magic stones. They rely on the ingenious body, heavy iron armor, and iron spears to attack the human city. This is well documented in the history books. The war is a hundred years, then humans The territory was swallowed a little bit until it completely retreated to the fertile plains.” She sighed when she said this. “At that time, when we were closest to victory, if we could take the witch as the head and train the fighting witch forces, the devil could not step on it. Take a step into the light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; "Then they have all kinds of magic stones?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably, the second means of war, their means will become more diverse "Ai Gesha's tone is low. "This war lasted only thirty-five years, and we were completely defeated. Although the elite saints can compete with the hell lords, the number of enemies is much larger than ours. Listening to the predecessors of the federation, the witches can still take advantage of the field in the past ten years. An extraordinary army can kill the devil's army. However, after more and more personnel losses, we can only stick to the city." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the prince was silent for a long time and seemed to be thinking about serious issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he finally realized the terrible thing about the devil. Ai Gesha thought that not only the number but also the progress is amazing, waiting for this attack, I don’t know. What kind of army will appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
