			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire in the house burned and the half of the floor was red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the snoring of firewood, and looking at the north wind and the snow drifting outside the window, Ajima felt full of warmth. Perhaps it is the sequelae of rummaging through the garbage in the garbage pile during childhood. When it is winter, her hands will produce frostbite and cracked mink. After moving to the sleeping island, it will not improve, but because of long-term exposure to salty The sea water has become more serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, her finger has only a few shallow mouths, no bloodshot, no pain, even though she ate it when she was begging. The bitter, frostbite sore is not unbearable, but no one will dislike the pain less. This kind of whole-body experience is almost forgotten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living environment without winter city does have indescribable magic, even if it is a common place, it is very different from other towns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in this brick house, the walls are covered with thick mortar on both sides, and every corner of the window is closely connected with the masonry, even if the outside snow Large, indoors will not be affected much, otherwise it is difficult to maintain sufficient temperature by a single fireplace. In exchange for the ordinary residence of Jin Suicheng, I am afraid that there are four leaks at the moment, and the doors and windows whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are holes in the fireplace, which can introduce a part of the heat into the bedroom bed next door. When the night is turned off, the bed is basically warm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a small part of what she found. Such as the details, no winter city is everywhere, the longer you live, the deeper your feelings - sometimes Ajima can't help but wonder if the city is not built because people need to settle down here. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a paradise born for enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why it is built in the worst of the West, it is due to the strong contrast: the warmth felt in the spring season, Obviously not as impressive as the warmth of ice and snow. The more impossible it is, the more commendable it is when it is reached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment, she almost believed this idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The soup is stewed, dinner can be eaten." Doris took a pot of soup out of the kitchen and placed it on the low table in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "... trouble you," Ajima handed a cushion to the other party and sat down at the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two dishes and one soup, all based on mushrooms - this western-style specialty called the bird mushroom, has a very good taste and aroma Thick juice, no need for extra seasoning, as long as sprinkle with some salt, no matter what the method is delicious. But she also knows that this is actually the cheapest food in the winter city, and its price is comparable to that of wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I took the market and sold it, bought a lot of mushrooms and squatted in the room," Doris said happily. "I will break the grain this winter." These mushrooms should also be enough for us to start in the spring. Although the taste will not be so delicious after a long time, at least we can fill our stomachs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akimar Take a spoonful of soup, under the illumination of the fire, the little oil floating on the soup surface reflects the golden luster, which is quite attractive. Into the mouth, full of fresh fragrance suddenly filled her mouth, and along the hot soup all the way into the stomach, so that the entire abdomen warmed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still an impeccable taste, but she doesn’t have the appetite of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only two spoonfuls, Ajima put down the small bowl in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Doris quickly noticed her strangeness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was thinking...the decision of the day was not wrong," Akima whispered for a long time. "It should have been me only when I left here." People’s plans now let everyone and long-lost relatives lose their chances of a better life. If they don’t leave the sleeping spell, they may have lived in a heated house at this moment, instead of several people huddled in In a small house, there is no room for turning over."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
