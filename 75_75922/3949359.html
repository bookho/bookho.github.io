You will continue to shoot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new recruits who filled the rifle and were responsible for loading, bent Waist to the other side. The wounded person’s mind was fairly clear, and he asked slyly, “Captain, I... will I die?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spear pierced him The position of the chest is lower, it is not clear whether it has caused penetration, seeing that his breathing is still smooth, and should not hurt the lungs. During the culture class, His Royal Highness Prince briefly described the role of various organs in the human body and the emergency measures during the injury. In such a situation, the best way he can think of is to stay still and wait until the battle is over to let Miss Nanava come. treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pain?" Brian asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freckles have nodded in a difficult position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It hurts to mean you won't die," the Cavaliers put his hand on his forehead. "You should know Miss Nana's ability?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," freckles barely smiled. "Everyone usually... wants to see her, so to speak... I, I can see her too." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, so you have to hold on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blair said Before returning to the shooting window, the recruits looked back worriedly. "Don't you pull the spear out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put it out and it is easy to cause a lot of bleeding. When you learn this, you will naturally understand," he paused. "What we can do now is to defeat the enemy as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stood on the high platform and could clearly see the enemy rushing into the town like a tide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever they cross a row of bunkers, the speed will slow down a lot. When crossing the third row of bunkers, the enemy's abdomen is completely exposed to the crossfire of the shooter. under. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of echo is very obvious, although the team has been drawn into strips, but most people still follow the "concentration charge" command issued by the witch, on the road Going on the line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every moment there are a lot of people falling down, and they have nothing to do with it. In the face of the fortifications that cannot be destroyed by the sword and spear guns, the militia units of Tiefko can only endure the injury and continue to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third hundred meters behind the third row of bunkers is the artillery position - within this distance, belonging to the dead zone covered by the bullet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning in the sky has changed the flag to a bright red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angle of the twenty-armed artillery was flattened, and the flame and smoke were sprayed forward. Roland roughly estimated that the most effective shot can be in the second Shooting a shot in ten seconds, and about half a minute. At first glance, it seems to be close to the excellent shooting rate of the American Civil War. However, the latter's three-time performance per minute is a performance in solid shots, and many times are used for artillery reset and repeated aiming. There is no need to aim when launching a shotgun, no need to wipe the cannon, and the rate of fire can be raised even higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the enemy, this is a terrible rate of fire. The killing of the armored target is particularly striking. Almost every iron pill can penetrate. Two to three people, although the pill can resist the pain, but can not suppress the fear. When watching the people around you being screened one by one, even the excitement and the desire for killing can no longer suppress the fear of life instinct, let alone they are not hard-working steel forces, no pills, these A person is nothing but a group of untrained civilians who lack actual combat experience. When half of the people were lying on the assault road, the enemy began to emerge as a fugitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear spreads like a plague. With the first one, the second and third soon appeared, and the striker completely stopped. Go forward, start turning direction, and retreat toward the back. The artillery group replaced the solid bomb again and fired at the center of the road, while the firearms in the bunker never stopped shooting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
