			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland had already listened to Tasa’s details before meeting the new witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not expect that the long-lost Tillie Wimbledon became the leader of another witch organization, and also grabbed the front of her own, the gray fort The witches in the king’s country have gathered most of them. What is even more intolerable is that she still wants to put her claws into her own territory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale said that the witch is an extraordinary person, and the ability is likely to be partial combat type. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any extraordinary person deserves to be treated with caution, so when meeting the ashes in the office, Roland stood next to Anna in addition to the invisible nightingale. At the desk, there are a few tiny black fires that make up the wall that the naked eye can't detect. As long as she dares to rush up, she will be divided into several segments by these thin lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhanced witches do not wear the stone of the gods, they are not dominant in the witch battle, but once they wear the stone, they have unlimited Destructive power. Fortunately, the god stone is hated by the vast majority of witches, and the ashes probably took this into consideration. When the town was pulled over, the town did not carry the iconic items of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your witch? Don't be arrogant, they are all living people, not your personal belongings!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was shackled, and for the first time after he crossed, he felt the dilemma of losing his mouth. I used to be accustomed to my people, my people, and so on, but now I have been criticized by unexpected democratic speech, which has made him extremely savvy. Although according to the practice of this era, the lord does not have any problem with the name of the person or thing on the territory, but nowadays it is purely emotional intelligence in the face of the nightingale and Anna, and is brought into the pit by the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he coughed twice, from the good flow: "I never thought about it. They stayed in the town because of their own wishes, and I believe, here It is also their best destination. As for the place of the fjord you said, it is very dangerous to say that the trip across the sea is very dangerous. The fjord's climate is unpredictable. It has been hit by storms and tsunami all the year round. It is not a place to live. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But at least there, the power of the church is minimal. The witch can transform her home by her own power to fight against natural disasters, but there is no way to fight against the stone of God." The church, let alone the fines of the gods." Ashes said mercilessly, "Do you know how stupid things you have done? The news of the spread will only entice the church to come to the door. I will bluntly say that you have no way." Fighting the gods and letting the witch leave your territory is the right way to avoid tragedies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has listened to Wendy before. Intelligence, he knows to use force to convince each other than anything else They are more effective. Of course, he can ignore the ashes, but in this case, it is equivalent to completely giving up the witch who is trying to win Terry Wimbleton. Despite the hope, he still wants to try. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you fight a few gods at the same time?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray face looks a bit confusing, but in the end she still sticks out three fingers. "If you are three, I can still handle it."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a contest," Roland sat up straight and said seriously. "Let the results of the test tell you whether I have ever won the Prisoner." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say...what?" Ashes for a moment, the cold face finally showed a different expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A fair trial, one-on-one," he said word by word. "If you can beat you positively, you will prove that I have the ability to resist the church." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash reveals a "you are crazy" expression, "You and me? Or say...you want the witches to play?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not me, not a witch, the gods will definitely have a stone of punishment," Roland smiled. "Your opponent is an ordinary Knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is some regret in not being able to play in person, the other party is a superb witch who is a powerful watcher. It can be seen from Wendy's description. Alone in the monastery, he was stunned and stunned, and he was able to escape under the chase of many gods. Even if it is an empty hand or a wooden sword, it can exert an extraordinary lethality. The actual combat effect of the revolver is still to be studied. To be on the safe side, he decided to hand over this glorious task to Carter. If he has an AK47 in his hand, then he has to go on himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
