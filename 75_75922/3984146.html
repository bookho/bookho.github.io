			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night in the window, through the glass to look at the city under the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim shadow continues in the night, outlines the walls of the kingdom, and under the light, the three walls reveal subtle differences - most recently The walls of the palace are light gray, and the turpentine torches that hang on the wall illuminate the surroundings. At first glance, it looks like a gemstone belt with overlapping light and dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More far away is the inner wall, with gray in the gray, like a long snake wrapped around the city - even after the king is easy to change, the inner city is still shining Hey. The nightingale was the first time I saw a place that was more heated than the town of Bianbu. This fierce and short-lived war has little effect on the underlying nobles and wealthy businessmen, and night is still the best moment for their indulgence and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, the earth suddenly fainted, as if the light was blocked by the long snake, the most magnificent bluestone wall was immersed in the darkness, only to faintly Go to the little starfire on the head of the city. The outer city, like most towns she has seen, falls silent as night falls. In contrast to the large dark areas, the lights in the inner city seem to be weak, but this does not affect people singing and dancing... I don't know why, the nightingale suddenly remembered the human beings who were forced to the corner of the mainland. The vast ray of light has been swallowed up by the darkness, and the devil and the evil beast lurk in it, but most people have no knowledge of it and continue to indulge in the glow of this little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, exhausted," Wendy’s voice interrupted her thoughts, and saw the red-haired witch walking to her side with her shoulders, and her Kneeling on the window sill together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are asleep?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it’s been a long time, now it’s finally Tired," Wendy yawned. "I really don't know where they came from. I obviously flew around the hydrogen balloon for a whole day, and actually clamored to hear the story."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should thank you," the nightingale couldn’t help but smile. "If you didn't make three sets of exercises last time, I am afraid they will go out to explore tonight, not to listen to the story." Looking back, I can see from the balcony to the bedroom that the wheat is lying on the lightning, the white hair is almost covered with the little girl's body. "They are really getting together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the room in the palace is more spacious and is arranged according to the living room with a two-bedroom layout, the witches who follow Roland are pressed The method of sharing the room by four people. I have to say that this is the most magnificent place in the entire gray fort, even if it is a guest room, carpets and bedding are also made of good woven materials, some nightingales can still name, such as velvet and silk, and some of her I can't even tell the material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Indeed," Wendy also showed a soft smile. "I have heard that Terry said that the wheat was used to be a pigeon. Sleeping on the beam. A little bit of noise will wake her up, and maintain the transformation is to be able to escape from danger at any time. Now, she can finally sleep like a normal girl." She said it was paused here. There was some emotion in the voice. "We pressed the chip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale did not answer...and did not need to answer. As long as it is the witch who survived the co-sponsorship, it will have the same feeling. At the time of life and death, the lords of Bentham Town extended a helping hand to them and promised to bring them a new world. Now, the sisters have not only seen the dawn, but even found that the new world is almost within reach. When the sacred mountain pursued in the past 100 years is about to become a reality, this gratitude and approval is far from being described in a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two were silent for a long time, until the midnight bell came from afar, Wendy asked again, "You... want to go back and see Look?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where?" The nightingale did not return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver City, your home." She pointed to the guide. "It’s only half a day away from here. If you let McMug bring you in the past, half. I can't use it for a while. You...and there is a younger brother there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale didn’t expect the other person to mention this, hesitating after a little while Immediately shook his head. "Now it is time to rectify the city's order. The potential enemies are everywhere. I can't leave my majesty in one step. After the gray castle is settled, there are still many opportunities to go to Silver City to see if there is no need to rush." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought that you would emphasize that you and the Ge Lan family have long since separated, just like in the past," Wendy seemed to be relieved to hear this answer. "You seem... no longer hate your brother?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
