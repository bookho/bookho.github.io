			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two days, Tassar kept going to and from the Margaret Chamber of Commerce and the outskirts of Wangdu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vessel that the fugitive picked up was provided by Margaret, and the first army would serve as a mercenary to the Canal Dock in the agreed time. The fugitives boarded the ship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for spreading news, seductive hooks, black hammers are already familiar, Tasha is not worried about this. It is much more convenient for rats to do this kind of thing than the outsiders. Although the scope is only in the Beicheng District, the fleeing people will definitely spread each other. And he couldn't take everyone away at once, and the Highness gave it up. This thing can be done slowly. It is a boat to send away a boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the day of the arrival of the fleet, nearly 1,000 displaced refugees came to the dock, which was unexpected for Tassa. If you rely on the first army to promote, it can be believed that hundreds of people are not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the screening requirements of His Royal Highness Prince, he first asked the child to board the ship, followed by the family with children, and finally the adult. As for the elderly... He found that there were almost no old people with white hair in the crowd, maybe they would not go to a remote place to take risks, or they could not escape from the east to the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first fleet of ten sloops took more than 500 people and set off. The rest were driven back to the camp, but they also took them back. The news that "the fleet will come again." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that the first task of His Royal Highness was successfully completed. I didn’t expect Tassa to encounter a tricky shortly after the merchants shipped the second batch of people. Trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a strange illness in Wang Chengzhong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first person found was lying on the side of the road. There was a piece of dark spots on his body, his teeth fell off, his skin cracked, and the blood that flowed out changed color. - Just as a witch is as horrible as it was swallowed by the power of the demon. The deceased is not a woman, but a male civilian living in the North District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several bodies with the same symptoms found in the land, and some people who have been exposed to the body have begun to grow dark spots, whether with herbs or Ice can not make it fade, even in the bloodletting treatment, the blood is red and black, as if mixed with a lot of ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear spreads quickly in the crowd, and there are more and more people going to church to pray, but everything is useless, and people with dark spots appear on it. The more, even the fugitives outside the city have the same symptoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church's high priest stood up and declared that it was a witch's plot, and they released the power of the devil to infect other innocents. At present, any treatment can't resist the power of evil spirits, and those who are eroded will die in extreme pain. But the church will never sit idly by, and they have developed the Holy Spirit drug to contain the evil power of this hell devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This preach made the infected people see a glimmer of life. They sat around the church every day, waiting for the release of the holy medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tassa is deeply suspicious of the church’s claims, but in order to prevent it, he temporarily suspended the delivery of fugitives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why stop?" The black hammer said that he was extremely puzzled. "Now the guys are also eroded by the evil spirits, don't hurry to send far away, is it still? Do you want them to stay outside the city to make seeds for the witch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the meaning above," he said impatiently. "Just ordinary evacuees still Well, if the West is also infected by this evil, what will the kingdom look like?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃-"The black hammer is slightly stunned, "but the West What does it look like is not our business, Master Tassa, if you don’t hear the above, drag them all away. Think about it, this kind of ghost thing can be touched as long as it touches. Erosion, I don't want to stay with a lot of hell devils, even if they are separated by walls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it not heard? I only have one The head," Tassa coldly said, "You have only one. As I said!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left the pub and found a standard Margaret caravan emblem of the shop, showed the token. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
