			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...what? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland tried to make a sound or move the body without getting any feedback. The picture of light and dark constantly flashed in front of his eyes and looked like a slide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless black spots walking back and forth around the tiankeng, like ants nesting, and gradually, a high platform rises. However, compared to the huge tiankeng, the vast high platform is only equivalent to a land bag with a slight uplift. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he was surprised to find that he had seen this building made of rough stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-On the mural of the cursed temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his mind, the picture covered with snowflakes is also a lot closer in the "嘶嘶" sound... those black spots become one by one Creepy creatures, their appearance should be combined with the "main body" in the murals, the radioactive family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, the sight in front of you seems to overlap with the mural content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a dozen subjects hold the relics of the gods on the high platform, and around the circle, the body swells and shrinks, like a certain ritual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the high platform, tens of thousands of stickmanes were taken around the tiankeng, and then pushed into the bottomless in the dance of the radioactive Potholes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this avid atmosphere, the last piece of relics was put together, and the crystals that were cut through became a complete and smooth vertebral body. It blooms with dazzling light, drifts toward the tiankeng, then falls straight down and quickly disappears into the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly realized that this may be the "bottomless" mentioned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is just the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next scene made Roland's eyes wide open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw an orange light column in the tiankeng, straight into the sky, this scene, if the ancient witch opened the vision of the dream world, but More grandiose. And the position in the sky is just right in front of the "Red Moon", which is where the erosion is. For a moment, the heavens and the earth seem to be connected together. The so-called bottomless and erosive mouth is only the two ends of the light column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radioactive family flocked to the tiankeng like a moth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they did not fall into the abyss, but floated lightly, as if they were held, rising toward the end of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one time, there were countless black spots in the light column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is...the promotion of civilization...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the black spots in the soft In the light column hidden in the cloud, Roland can not help but think, get rid of the bondage of the earth, into the new world... such a magnificent scene, I am afraid that anyone will be tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in such a scene, he heard a thick sigh - the sound seemed to echo directly in his mind, clear and impossible to be an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sigh, the flow rate of time is significantly faster, and the snow-like noise is getting denser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change of the picture keeps the earth like a sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are scattered towns along the patio. Probably not all radiologists have chosen to join the light column, but a small part of it stays. Is it because of the nostalgia for the world, or the fear of the sky and the unknown? Roland is not known. He only saw occasional black spots coming into the channel connecting the heavens and the earth, like the adventurers in the legendary story of chasing the sages and embarking on the unknown, but they were lonely compared to the scenes of the first ethnic group. It has a lot of shapes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light of the light column is getting darker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a moment, it flashes twice and disappears completely without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
