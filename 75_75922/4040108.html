			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, when the first sun shines into the living room, he opens his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table fan blew the hot air all night, and the sound of "Knowing - Knowing--" screamed outside the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now I can confirm that sleeping in a dream doesn’t make me return to reality, Roland thinks, and can also play a role of rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this sounds a bit strange, but... just let it work, as long as it works. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He yawned from the couch and was preparing to go to the kitchen for breakfast, and suddenly there was a scream of Jieluo in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she appeared red at the door and pointed at Roland, stuttering, "Yesterday I...you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sofa I slept yesterday," the latter shrugged. "Please, you are sweating and you haven't bathed, I won't sleep with you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl smacked the collar and smelled it, her face became redder, and compared with the long white hair, it was no different from a mature apple. She panicked and ran back to her bedroom for a while, and took a wash and changed clothes into the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the shower sounded soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she came out, Roland had already had breakfast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the breakfast is much richer than the usual monotonous fried egg fritters - fried bacon, salt and pepper, dried fish and a plate of fresh grape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, all the raw materials come from the holy city after the iron gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you bought meat?" Jielu was wrapped in a wet turban and asked in amazement. She could see her throat twitching, apparently swallowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I bought a lot and put it in the fridge," Roland handed her a pair of chopsticks. "I found a new job."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Her voice suddenly became excited, and what just happened seemed to be left behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will get a salary soon," Roland laughed. "These are bought for celebration."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little girl sighed. "I thought you finally broke the bottom line and did something irreparable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp What is irreparable? He secretly swears, can't he be this guy think he will steal it? Uh... It seems that robbery in the dream world is no big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, was it because you were looking for a job to get the sun to heat up?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Probably...", he threw a grape into his mouth. "In the future, you don't have to worry about money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really fragile," Xunzi, "When can you not let people worry so much, uncle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland almost got caught by the grape, "It seems as if you are always worried about me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." This time it was the turn of the clean and dumb fire. After a while, she blinked. "The breakfast you made is a waste of raw materials, pickled." The meat has obviously let go of the salt, and you have added one more to it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy will transform the topic, Roland puts a piece of bacon in his mouth, "I feel good, that is, some places are not fried."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me do it later, really," said that, Jieluo still Quickly sweep the food out of the plate, then take the bag out of the door. "The dish is ready, I will wash it with dinner when I come back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Wait," Roland stopped her. "Do you know where there is an old bookstore nearby?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it took him three days to get out of the dream. When he woke up, the sun without the winter city had risen to the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the time flow on both sides is almost one to eight, which means that one night in the real world can be used as two natural days, if Counting the time spent on bed, it will not be noticeable for three days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing Roland climbs up is to find a golden dragon and then put it in his hand -<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden dragon does not move, but the fingers are pinched and painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the inexplicable power will only appear in the dream, he sighed, put the golden dragon back, put on the coat and sit at the desk . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland intends to transcribe the key knowledge of his own recollection when his memory is in a clear state, including missing parts of various basic subjects, as well as some large Detailed design drawings of industrial equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these three days, he has not been idle. The sales issue went smoothly. He first found a local second-hand goods forum and posted pictures of armor on the Internet, claiming that a group of medieval imitation crafts were sold at low prices. Due to the excellent workmanship and extremely low price, buyers soon found Come to the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last armor was sold in five hundred sets, handcuffs and one hundred short slashes. Anyway, there is no business, Roland does it a little. Children are not heartbroken. However, Jinlong is much more difficult to sell than he imagined. Even if all the dough is made into a round cake, the bank does not accept gold goods that are sold informally – whether it is gold bars or gold ornaments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold store also touched the wall, and several gold shops in the vicinity only recycled the accessories sold in the store, and a fee was also charged. Instead, a salesperson gave him an address, saying that there is an old pawn shop there, which can recover gold goods of unknown origin, but the price is only half of the market price. I thought that Jinlong was only a dozen pieces in total, and the texture was far from pure gold. Roland simply threw them all into the closet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this effort, he might as well move a few more armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the three jewels, Roland did not know who to sell to, and finally could not get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having the balance, he immediately swept the old bookstore near the apartment building and bought all the materials he had seen - as for those who have not seen it. There is a cover on the light, and the pages are all blank. Obviously, the dream world has not exceeded his consciousness, and it is impossible for Anna to master the whole field for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has a wide range of hobbies, browsing the vast amount of useless knowledge on the Internet, using the Internet to find some drawings that I have only seen at a glance, can get detailed s answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these necessities that can quickly improve the level of technology without winter city, Roland also bought two new clothes for Jielu and added a winter camp for himself. Equipment, spent a lot of money on the earned money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can now remember the shock and incredulity that Xiaotoutou showed when he got new clothes, and he took it off several times before accepting it. There is no such age at all. There should be no scruples. When he asked strangely, he only knew that the other party was receiving the gift for the first time. It was not bad to have her at home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the founder of the dream, Roland feels a little guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been busy until noon, and the nightingale is quietly appearing in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't go on breakfast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Roland didn't lift his head. Going back, "Trouble you for a lunch for me, I will eat it in the bedroom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the result of your morning?" Surprisingly grabbed a stack of manuscript papers at the table. "How come suddenly so many ideas come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They themselves exist in my mind, just I forgot it for a while," Roland moved to the wrist. "Look, what do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the form of integral... describe the electromagnetic field in... some A volume...a mathematical model?" The nightingale helped the road, "Your Majesty, my head is a little dizzy, I will go to dinner for you first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
