			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most people, this night is a rare moment of relaxation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Devil's Floating City is still moving in the direction of Hermes, day and night, at least in the morning, the king can't see this scene. Staying away from the front line gives everyone a short silence, especially when they will rush to the battlefield and go to the next day. This kind of tranquility is even more commendable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Andrea entered the family house, Horford Quin had already waited for her at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome home, daughter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." Andrea Pico Nodded. This is a year after she returned to the family house again, and it was not intrusive, but entered with the help of the servant. To be honest, she would like to spend these hours with Tilly, but when she received the invitation from the other party, she felt a touch of emotion in her heart, and finally agreed to come down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of thing, obviously can tell her directly after the meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably... He is also afraid of rejecting it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it was time to face, she didn’t know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is different from the last meeting. At that time, she came with a task, but now it is just a reunion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to... talk to me?" In the aisle, Andrea asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A lot, like what you experienced on the front line, such as your partner, such as Mr. Roland Wimbledon..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was just a fool, nothing to talk about--" Andrea replied casually, then realized that something was wrong, "Oh, I mean..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can see that he is a tolerant lord." Hofford smiled. "Reassured, I know that you are not fit, if only two people Conversation, I am afraid this night will be very difficult, so I made some preparations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prepare?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You will understand when you go in." He stopped at the door of the main hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia has some doubts pushing the door open, not seeing the situation in the house, a figure will come straight to her -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to die you, Quinn sister!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that...<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her hand a little bit funny, letting the other person hold her full. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s Benedin Losey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, there are two other people at the long table - Otto Rossi and Oro Tokat. The latter two also looked quite excited, and Otto even seemed to feel a little helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scene instantly made Andrea look back more than a decade ago, she has not yet awakened to become a witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belinda’s enthusiasm and Oro’s enthusiasm quickly resolved the initial stiffness, and the father who almost never talked with the younger generation was rare. The land sat with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to chat with himself, he really has a hard time...Andreia suddenly discovered that the hate in his heart is almost There is not much left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, wait until the end of the war, we have to go to the Winter City, and we will meet often." Belinda yelled at her. eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia surprised and raised his eyebrows, "You mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course we are three people together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait... Otto and Oro are family heirs? Leave the territory for a long time, can the two old counts in your family promise?" Andrea looked suspiciously at Otto, couldn't be this guy In the dark? It’s too irresponsible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...not what you think," Otto waved his hand and stuttered. "Although I hope so, but that is only part of it." Factors...Total, in short..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me explain it." Belinda patted her brother's shoulders mercifully, then to Ander Leah said, "You rarely stay in the morning, so you don't know what has changed recently. Nowadays, in big cities, especially in the aristocratic circle of Glow City, there is a saying that it is a family. Natural science knows nothing, then it is destined to be declining."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natural Science? Could it be..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Belinda nodded with a smile. "At first it was the "National Science Theory Foundation" published by Wintertown, but it has now been refined into multiple disciplines. Some people call it It is a new sage, and some people think that alchemy and astrology are only part of it, but no matter what, there is indeed such a wind in the aristocratic circle. As long as it is a natural science book from No Winter City, there will be high-priced acquisitions by merchants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The father was also affected, so when we put forward this idea At the time, he was not too opposed—after all, self-study was better than no one to guide.” She went on to say, “Not to mention that several families have gone ahead, and the father probably does not want the Losey family to fall behind. So this is not irresponsible! In the words of his father, he still has no problem for a few more years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are just being The plane and the steel ship were irritating," Oro shrugged with disapproval. "Of course, I can go out and travel, I will support my hands."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I want to say... that's exactly what it is." Otto sighed. "And, we are going to have a book club."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That again What?” Andrea was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are so many natural sciences, only three of us are too few." Belinda said, "So we want to pick some qualifications." Merchants and civilians give them a chance to get in touch with nature. If they are outstanding, they will be included in the family, which is a multitude of things. What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Andreia didn't know what to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly realized that both her father and others were changing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witches who were seen as taboos in the past, as well as the sorcerer who shunned the witches and dispels the power of the aristocracy, will never be the target of the early-stage people who are willing to follow the example of learning. It is also contrary to tradition to include ordinary people with ordinary ancestry in the family. But now, these well-defined borders have begun to blur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but hope for her father, Horford Quinn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that there must be his guidance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is really working to make up for his mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened can never be eliminated, but subsequent changes can at least make it no longer repeat the same mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what you want to express, father? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, the Grey Fort and the morning and the morning jointly launched action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobility has set up nearly 100 access points on the northwestern traffic route to provide dry food and tent shelter for the refugees in panic. The First Military Medical Team treated the injured under the protection of the Witched Witch. The most intensive places for escapers often sound very soft and pleasant songs - even those who are mad and restless will quickly settle down under such a voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hermes Church also launched a parade under the leadership of the new Pope Isabella to appease the displaced who were forced to leave their homes - even after All kinds of storms, the church still has a certain influence among the people. For them, except for the gray-great people who have the ability to fight the devil, there is only the church that serves the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
