			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland met Wendy and Tilly in the living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The current situation is like this..." He told the frontline message roughly, "We're afraid we can't drag it anymore."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The First Army needs the help of a witch," Wendy sighed. "I will inform everyone - they have been resting for so long, they should be ready." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I finally waited for you to speak," Tilly grinned. "The flight manual is just a short battle. I have long wanted to go to the front line to verify." I have been thinking about a long-term idea. Also, what about a good fighter? Don’t forget to promise me, brother.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland didn’t play as usual It’s not that I don’t want to, but the sound seems to be stuck in my throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello?" Wendy seems to have noticed his anomaly. "Are you alright?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Roland tried his best to calm down his feelings and slowly nodded. "You all know that the Red Moon is already in the world. This will be the last war that humanity has to face... but no one knows how long it will last, maybe It’s a year, maybe a decade. This time it’s very likely that it will not come back until the end of the war, if...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found himself faintly unable to say It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can predict the final direction of this war of gods, the last time the ash was smashed in the fertile plains, this time, how many people can support The end of the war? There are many people in the Witch Alliance who are in their early twenties. In another world, they should still enjoy a carefree university life, but now they are an indispensable force in the battle for fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This war is about the prospects of all mankind. Everyone must go all out. As a part of humanity, there is no essential difference between a witch and an ordinary person. Roland doesn't understand, but the feelings are not the truth. Since the establishment of the alliance, he and everyone have been together for so many years, and now it is very likely that this time it will be the last time to meet, the order to issue the election will always be difficult to export. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you are seen by others, you will laugh out loud." Tilly snorted. "It’s been so many years, you Haven't adapted to this position yet? Of course... I don't hate it anymore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be rude, kneel down." Wendy stood up and said. When Roland reacted, she had already walked behind and leaned over and hugged him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does this make you worry less?" she said softly. "Everything you do, everyone sees it, even if you If you don't say a word, everyone will take the initiative to stand up - after all, you teach us that you can't get anything without fighting. There is no essential difference between winning the battle of God and protecting the holy mountain. I believe other sisters think so. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warmth behind the scenes calmed Roland down, that's right...not only he thinks so alone, everyone knows that this day will come sooner or later. If you want to escape, you don't have to wait until now. Since the witches are there, their minds are already self-evident. If at this time he goes to say something like "I don't want to fight for a strong family" and "If I want to stay, I can ask it at any time", it seems a bit sensational. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to go all out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty smiled and returned to his seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So," he took a deep breath and stared at the two, "The Witch Alliance and the Air Cavaliers. When you are ready, you can start to support the front line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you wish, sire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Package on me, brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news that the witch is about to embark on the wolf heart soon spread throughout the castle area, lightning only used For half an hour, the required bag items were cleaned up – a backpack with ammunition and seals, a waist pocket stuffed with seasonings and salt, and a wheat bran placed on top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Not so urgent,” Wendy reached out and hugged the wheat. “In fact, someone asked me before, I hope to see you before I leave.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See me?" Lightning glimpsed, "Who? Margaret?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Wendy murmured, "You see When you get to nature, you will understand. Right, that person is now in the courtyard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the message so well-informed?" Lightning shrugged, "That's good." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕-咕!" Mai Hao also wants to follow the past, but Wendy is firmly in his arms, can only watch The lightning disappeared at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, you will be here with me for a while," Wendy smiled and touched the head of the pigeon. "At this time, I think the other person wants more." Can be alone with her for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning out of the castle, along the long The corridor entered the courtyard and at first glance saw the slightly fancy back in the yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What? It turned out to be Mr. Sander. Mr. Bird," she muttered. "Are you looking for me?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the other person turned around, the little girl slammed into place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although wearing the same suit, he is obviously not what he was when he first saw it. Although it has not been seen for many years, the appearance of the other party is still overlapping with the impression in memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father...pro?" She had some unbelievable openings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I’ve been staring at you." Thunder smiled. "I didn't want my daughter to go to the mother's old road, so I decided to temporarily break with you." Open contact - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When did you hear that I was here?" Lightning whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You haven’t been to Bianbu Town for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ya Margaret Aunt tells you ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you are all accomplices? And Roland is also..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Blame them, this is what I strongly urge them to do this--"Thunder did not finish talking, then saw her daughter walked toward him, one of the fists had been lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He closed his eyes and waited for a blow of lightning and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the pain in the expectation did not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a sigh, the Thunder opened his eyes a little surprised, but saw his daughter’s fist as a palm, gently patted on his forehead, while the corner of his mouth was exposed. A smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, I’m all on the adventure tour of the Grey Fort West."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"呃..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Discover the holy city of Tacchar, find a living witch four hundred years ago, dig deep underground civilization, repel the devil's The advance army..."Lightning retracted the hand, "How is it better than your achievements?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder for a while, only I laughed when I touched my head. "It’s my daughter, it’s just that the reunion is really gratifying and regrettable..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me understand, "What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's why you grew too fast," Thunder's tone relaxed a lot. "I thought you would hate me." I will either pounce into my arms and cry, and it seems that I am worried too much..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
