			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the worm really used this as a nest." After the basket fell, Ai Gesha held a glowing magic stone and looked around. Circle, frowning tightly, "Is you finding Fran?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Fryland is not here," Lightning has already been reviewed, "Blackrock Tower is like It was stuck in the center of the cave, with a gap on each side. Will she fall on the tower and roll off?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhombus-shaped stone tower two The end just embedded in the rock wall, like a bridge in the deep pit, no one knows how the other party did it. As for the tentacle devil hidden in the bottom of the tower, and the one-eyed demon, it has disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This thing does not affect my ability to use," the nightingale emerged from the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can't penetrate it like you walk through the wall, right?" Aegusa squatted and summoned a piece of ice to the Blackrock Spire. The ice cone is broken and the surface of the stone tower is unscathed. "It has been rumored that it was made of stone of God's punishment. Although it does not interfere with the magic of a large area like the prism of the god stone, it can still be able to Isolation of magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not manufacturing, but growing," Elena rectified, "The corrupted magic can change the effect of the stone veins and promote It grows into a square monument, but only the root that was born under the Red Moon has the ability to make red fog. The rest is just to keep the red fog from dissipating so quickly—this is the highest secret in the federation era. But after Takira was destroyed, Eleanor told us all about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you say that early?" The nightingale was not happy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't tell me, there will be a devil's minaret here," Elena said. "There are so many things that can affect the magic, how can I possibly? I guess this is something."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to continue down," Lightning flew between the two and interrupted their confrontation. "The hole here." There is still a distance at the end. I just tried to fly down for a short time. I can hear the faint sound of running water. There may be a dark river underneath. If Miss Fulan really falls from both sides of the stone tower, maybe Come alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really?" Elena’s voice cheered up. “It’s because of the dark river, so Hilli Didn't you find the trail of Fran?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most likely," Aegusa nodded. "Most of the eye of the Eye of Magic is blocked by this stone tower." She will only say that she can't see the ground. If Fran is washed away by water, naturally she can't find the magic light. She turned and said to the lightning. "You first fly up and tell Wendy about our situation. Let her call Maggie to transport a part of the goddess of witches down... and the soldiers of the First Army, and let them set up a checkpoint here." , let's continue to explore down. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, give it to me." "The little girl nodded.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the basket going up and down, and The auxiliary transportation of the Magic Ark, and soon they gathered enough people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning took advantage of this time to complete the inspection of the space under the Blackrock Spire, sure enough As she expected, the vertical wall continued to tilt and the air became more and more wet. After a fall of thirty or forty meters, a wide underground river appeared in front of her eyes. Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow water flowing along the wall of the cave gathers into a rushing stream of water, pouring down from the hole, forming a waterfall, when approaching it, The little girl can feel the coldness and coldness of the face.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the water, the pits are covered with a variety of mosses and mushrooms, some of them The plant emits a faint blue light that illuminates the surrounding ground. Even without the glowing magic stone, the outline of the cave can be seen faintly; The fireflies that fly around are like the other world.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the witches and the Tsemula remnants landed at the bottom of the ark, none of them Not to be attracted by the sights in front of you.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is not in the winter city, it would be nice to plant these glowing fruits," the night sigh sighed. In the evening, everyone can see the road in the street. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
