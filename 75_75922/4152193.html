			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combat for all mankind...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Grand Chief did say that this war will Determining the destiny of mankind, but Ganda joined the First Army more for his own clan, and never considered what returns he would get from other people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a task he must complete, no matter how unrequited they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Tanda still thinks so, recalling the smile of the nurse and eating fresh and warm meals, he has a hot stream in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he did was perhaps more important than he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After eating a hearty meal, Trent returned to his team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shamin nine regiments to which he belongs are more new faces - it is not surprising that the rear is constantly transporting soldiers to the front line, which has both The veterans also have new recruits who have just been recruited. Since the frontline team will have some losses after each big battle, it is necessary to adjust and supplement the personnel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes Da Da happy is that he also found two partners who were defending at the same time in the clock tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you were all sacrificed there, only me and the card...Falun ran out," After the warm embrace, Dada patted it hard. The shoulders of the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the time, the luck was good. When the clock tower collapsed, we were looking at the bottom of the building. I was lucky enough to avoid all the falling rocks." Surviving comrades back, "It’s you Surprised, I can be safe in the corridor. I know that we will not leave first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, evacuation as soon as possible is the right choice." Shaking his head, in that case, even if it can survive, in all likelihood, it will hit the enemy who is coming to the clock tower. If it is not for Kabbah to save his life, he can't escape the encirclement of the devil. "Unfortunately, others don't have such good luck."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only half of the ten-person squad that survived - although for the sand people who have long been used to death, this There is too much experience in living and leaving, but there is still some sadness in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, after a long period of running-in and training, they have formed a new connection - this connection is as close as the clan's relatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But happy to be happy, there is always some doubt in the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of Feng Xiao Bao is self-evident, even if he can understand this. It is the fall of Jinshiling that will cause the line of defense to fall completely. In the same way, the abandonment of the Windsor Castle will pass all these pressures to the same, so that the fine sand city and the sinking pool face the same dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that the first army would stay in the city until it was completely swallowed up by the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a good time to survive, but it’s not as easy as he expected. If the First Army collapsed across the board, not only will the war of the tribes become meaningless, but the hope that the clan will not easily see will also be lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he was obsessed with the duties of obeying orders and his trust in the Grand Chief, he did not excuse these questions in the presence of two companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the Three Gods accept their souls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the chiefs shelter their lives "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After silently praying according to the customs of the people, the other party changed a topic. "Don't think about it, say something easier. You may not know, today." In the evening, an axe will come to inspect the camp, and there will be a drama here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Performance...Drama?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to boosting morale, the chief commander will certainly have new orders, which is not surprising. However, this kind of drama seems to be incompatible with the war... The Shamin does not have such an elegant preference. He does not understand why the two people's expressions will be so excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you have heard of it? The Drow of the Aosha clan. Silver Moon is one of the members of the troupe. !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a round of hovering, the Seagull landed steadily in the caged mountains Hey airport. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa walked down the ramp and first rushed to the medical camp with medical staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The situation of the injured person is reported," she put on a white doctor's robe, while she kept on the road. "The bed is sorted according to the first aid manual. The rules of the key organs are preferred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," the nurse who served as an assistant replied quickly. "There are a total of 300 in the camp. Twenty-six injuries, of which 55 were endangered, and the beds were placed in tents. In order to extend their survival time, most people took excessive amounts of retardants."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The retarder is not a problem, pay attention to the anti-shock treatment after the failure - if the pain is too intense, use the dream water to interrupt the aftereffect. You should have been waiting for it. Is the dream water to be poured in?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant Go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not the first time to assist Miss Angel, she still has difficulty adapting to this petite girl who looks like a girl who is no different from the girl next door. Old scholars generally give a steady indication of calmness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," Nana Wa stopped in front of the tent. "Before I asked for the treatment equipment, every patient was ready." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, but..." The nurse hesitated and unconsciously used the honorific words. "Do you really want to treat so many patients at once? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With past experience, more than 50 seriously injured people have to spend at least a few days of water treatment to truly turn to safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course." Nanawa smiled at her. "Do not worry, as long as I am there, they will all survive."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the other person’s confident smile, the nurse’s heartfelt worries suddenly dissipated a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took a deep breath and followed Miss Pine into the tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa stood up first after wearing special rubber worm gloves Bed in front of the patient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evolution of adulthood has given her ability new features, so that the original summoning ability can be attached to the object and will continue to hurt the surrounding area. Treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the direct infusion of magic to heal, the new ability is not as effective as the former, at least not to heal the wound at a visible rate. But in the same way, it consumes much less magic and does not require the ability to continue to perform - this is also the greatest advantage of the enchanting ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the demonized object persists, the patient's wound will heal slowly, which makes Nana Va likely to treat multiple patients at the same time. More importantly, it fundamentally eliminates the pain caused by the long-term rotation of the treatment and the repeated destruction of the wounds of the patients when the previous magic is insufficient. After the high-level awakening, she had experimented in the camp at the back of Shenchiwan. A piece of gauze attached to her magical force can last for several days to a week, which is enough to make the seriously injured person out of danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem is that after the magic is exhausted, the object will not disappear on its own, but will remain in the patient. At the same time, you want to make the magic work to the maximum effect, the magic must be as close as possible to the most severely affected parts. Therefore, Nanawa refers to the medical materials of the dream world, and regards sutures and gauze as the first choice for both inside and outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picks up the scalpel, skillfully cuts the wounded, blood-stained abdomen, finds the intestines broken by the bone spear, and quickly stitches them together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
