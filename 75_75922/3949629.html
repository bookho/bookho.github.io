			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a lapse of half a month, Roland finally embarked on his way home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After sweeping the four major families and Black Street rats with the power of Thunder, the Long Song Fortress temporarily became a white paper that he was allowed to use. All kinds of relief and resettlement measures are carried out in an orderly manner. The golden dragons and foods found in the Maple Leaf, the Running Wolf and the Wild Roses are not as rich as the Duke of Ryan. Together, they are also very amazing income. It is because of this that he can expand the scope of relief food to the people of the city without any worries, and use the time of porridge to carry out policy propaganda, the effect is not generally remarkable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of departure, the Second Army has already recruited 500 people in the plan, and the police department has a new team of about 200 people. Roland will leave half of the soldiers and Vader in the fortress. The purpose is to remove the daily defenses and vigilance, and more to train these newcomers into warriors as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that this blank period will not last for too long. If you don’t quickly establish a channel directly connected between the people and the city hall, you will have your own control to the grassroots level. The decaying and stale order will come back and fill the vacuum of this power. If he does not break, he will break through and stand behind. He has already completed the goal of breaking the big, and then it is the stage of greatness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confidence given to Roland is the solid backing of Bianbu Town, the total population has grown to more than 30,000, and more than half of the population is receiving basic education. The later generations are just the scale of the two middle schools, but in this era is already an amazing scale - the education that is popularized to every citizen is not purely literate, but also basic natural knowledge, political thinking... and instilling National consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress of the literary level allows him to have enough grassroots manpower to promote change; and the ignorant people who do not know why, and who suffer from suffering, The awakening of national consciousness will cause them to erupt unimaginable power. These people in the town are the kind of fire that he spreads. One day, they will set off the trend of the original on this continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the daylight fades, the looming outline of the town appears in front of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You look at it... what is that?" a nobleman behind him exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A... Bridge?" Another person looked up and said, "Oh my God, it is too long."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is impossible, only two pillars, how do you prop up such a long bridge deck?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait... ...it seems to be made of iron!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way back, Roland’s ship has dozens of nobles in addition to the witches, they are either shallow or shallow The title was low and he was far from the rebellion, so he escaped his cleaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the plan, they will study the management method of the department of the town hall in the town system, and then return to the fortress when the city is officially built, and help the establishment of the lower-level municipality. Hall, execute and feedback the commands issued by yourself. After losing the privilege of the aristocratic land, these people want to go further, and they can only rely on their own abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fleet crossed the steel bridge that was stained with silver, Roland heard the amazement of the aristocrats behind him. A person can't help but hold his breath and watch the iron bridge across the river pass over them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince could not help but feel a little funny, this group has not stopped since they sighed on board. First of all, why the hull made of stone is floating on the water, and then curious about the rotating paddle wheel and the steam engine that sprays the white mist. It is a pity that the town's three-way project has not yet been completed. He does not think about it with good intentions. Otherwise, when these people see bright and stable lights, they will surely surprise their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the whistle, the ship slowly docked next to the dock. Barov, Carter and a large number of city hall officials who have long received "Flying Pigeon Letters" have been waiting on the shore for a long time. When they see Roland appear, they still have a good sounding ceremony. The king’s rituals made a welcoming ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smiled and patted the shoulders of the two men, then brought Barov to the front of the many fortress nobles and introduced each other. "The accommodation, life and study of these people will be handed over to you," he whispered to the ear of the general manager. "You don't have to put their identity and title on the heart, but at most it is only the baron. What is in the mine?" Everyone has, still can't work honestly. Train them according to the way they graduate, and I want to see the results as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
