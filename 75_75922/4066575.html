			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lily, Lily, have you heard that?" Mystery Month rushed into the bedroom and put his face in front of Lily. "There is something going wrong in the college!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go away, you are blocking my light," she pushed the other's face away and continued to adjust the focal length of the microscope, but she sighed. Today's copy test is estimated to be ruined again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The scene not only came the explosion, but also ignited the fire. Who do you think would be done? Is the church still the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The church has been defeated by Roland, and the devil is thousands of miles away from us!" Lily looked up impatiently and gave her a blank look. "It is estimated which stupid person has stolen from the chemistry lab." Waste, then bring it into the classroom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar things have not happened, such as half a month ago, a researcher will take Unqualified fire cotton was brought back home, and it was used as a firelight for the stove. As a result, it was ignited by the child and almost burned the house. Afterwards, the temper of the boss was also sent, and he could hear the voice of the responsible person in the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the chemistry lab’s regulations were many times more numerous, and Lily had seen new regulations in the booklet – from a thin parchment It became a book with a thick index finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there is an explosion this time, how can you not care about what happened in the winter city, here is our home," the mystery of the month is plausible Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less people, you are just too curious, want to know the answer soon! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lily does not fight a fight, "Because of this, it should be handed over to more professional people to deal with, and then I am doing things for no winter. The development of the city." She paused. "It's you, I have been interfering with my experiments, and I have been idle all day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢?" Showing a strange smile, "Do you have any results?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃-" Lily suddenly felt a breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, right? You have been staring at the microscope for more than a year, but it didn't help you, and my electromagnetic power is already underarm." Bringing the light of the night, let people continue to work even at night." Mystery moon cocked his nose and said, "Oh oh... but I still don't dislike your old friend, to find out the truth of the problem, too Help for your majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trouble you to dislike me," Lily hated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn’t know why it’s always difficult to convert the mother into a specific kind of tiny bug, clearly that she can control the shape of the mother and be as close as possible to the assimilation The goal has never been able to break through this difficulty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl faintly felt that there was something missing between the two, but she could not find a specific clue, so that after the evolution of her ability, in addition to treating some cold epidemics The rest of the time was used to deal with the microscope. She can't promote the production level of no winter city like Anna and Soroya, and she can't bring happiness to everyone like Eveline. She has always been worried about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lily really likes to observe this complex world that is invisible to the naked eye, but... she doesn’t want to spend her money in vain, even though she will never verbally Admit this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now even the mysterious moon has come to her, this unpleasant feeling is really heartbreaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't, I'm wrong... you should be with me," I saw the strong pull, and the mystery month immediately resumed the pleading. She glared at Lily's arm. "There is no harm when going out. It will be ruined in the room all day!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, Lily would be hard to clean back to the absolute side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She impatiently opened the arm of the mystery month and looked at the latter and sighed. "I know, but I am not allowed to add to the sire and the night sister." Trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promise!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
