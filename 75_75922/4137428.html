			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it, Roland left the third city and immediately went to the ammunition factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Anna is not at the moment, but his vision is correct, this part of the transformation can be done by existing technology alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, only in this way, it has the value of mass production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cluster of guards, the unprepared workers suddenly fell over, and the scene was full of surprises and excitement. Looking at everyone's fanatical eyes, Roland realized that his behavior might be too impulsive, but since he has already arrived, he has to make a mistake and turn the trial journey into a journey of condolence inspection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not easy for the high-powered workers to return to their posts. He immediately told the responsible person, “Call the most skilled factory manager in the factory, I have something.” I want to try it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of the tracer is not complicated. Simply put, the solid warhead is hollowed out, filled with illuminants, oxidizers and delayed gunpowder, and then sealed with tailpipes and aluminum foil. When the bullet is fired, the propellant gas will break through the foil and ignite the delayed gunpowder until the illuminant burns, eventually forming a bright trail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all kinds of chemical industry's complete afterlife, this is just a matter of adding one more production line, but it is replaced by a winter city without extreme imbalance in industrial projects. Obviously it is a headache. The luminescent agent is generally a mixture of cerium nitrate, magnesium aluminum powder and cerium peroxide, which means that if a large-scale production of a tracer is desired, the industrial production line of these compounds must first be overcome. At what level of the chemical industry at his own site, Roland naturally knows that until now, the Ministry of Chemical Industry did not dare to say that it would be able to satisfy the supply of machine guns and ammunition of the First Army, let alone others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person in charge quickly found a craftsman - some unexpectedly, the other is not the old man with gray hair and trembling, but one Young and middle-aged people around the age of twenty-six. He was kneeling on one knee with excitement, like a knight's ritual. "Your Majesty, what can I do for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland responded, yes. No winter city has entered the era of mechanical production, and the younger generation with stronger learning ability is becoming the main force of the industrialization wave. This is also a scene that is difficult to see in the handicraft workshops. The speed of technological progress surpasses the advantage brought by age. In the face of new production tools, past experience no longer applies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now think about it, most of the busy people in the factory are around the age of 20 or 30, thinking that they have held important positions in key positions. The future of the gray fort is really It is worth looking forward to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded with satisfaction. "I want to add something new to the bullet. You can do as I said."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His idea is very simple. Since the "stone tablet" will shine brightly when it is severely deformed, the same trace effect may be achieved by the impact of gunpowder gas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific principle is similar to the punching machine - a gradual tightening of the gourd inside the warhead and a thin layer of stone in the bottom. When the bullet is fired, the expanded gas will squeeze the slice directly into the gourd. Due to the existence of the intermediate bayonet, even if the sub-pops are ejected, the slicing cannot be restored to its original state, which is equivalent to being in a reduced state, and thus continuously emits light until the potential is exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly explained a few words, fully understood his intentions for convenience, and promised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, a verification report was sent to Roland’s desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results prove that the method is indeed feasible. After many attempts, the successful 20-shot bullets can see obvious flashes, and the barrage is in everyone. A clear and identifiable light mark was left in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but be uplifted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the time, the night battle that can't see the shooting point is always a big weakness of the first army's fortress tactics. Even if you use the flare, you want to be in the dim light. It is still difficult to reach the shooting level during the day under conditions. In addition, if the machine gun is put on the plane, the problem will only become more prominent - even if it is a cloudless sunny day, the pilot may not know where he is going to hit the bullet. If you can achieve the indication effect in such a simple way, it will definitely be of great benefit to the upcoming battle of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem left is how many "stones" are available in the extreme south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later, two discoverers of the desert ruins arrived at the Shoal Harbor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room, Roland re-inquired about the wonders they found under the water hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answers of the two are also roughly the same as in the report - before the encounter with the giant armor, their exploration distance is only a few hundred meters, and the so-called There is nothing behind the "stone wall", completely ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the "stone" they see is probably just a small part of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, according to the murals, the number of bodies that can make blood gather into rivers should not be the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Shaman’s description of Sinbaddi makes him very concerned, that is, the environment in the cave is like the Yinchuan oasis, and even the gods that have been extinct in the rumor Make it flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the vast expanse of the past was really degraded into a desert because of the departure of the Three Gods, then the underground of the Endless Cape should be no exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the rumor itself is biased, or there are other mysteries hidden there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can’t wait to dig up the desert to see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After asking the situation, Roland left the fjord alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your diving suit is very interesting, and the traces found are enough to remember the annals," he slowly drank his mouth tea. "To be honest, see you can The steam engine is used in new inventions, which really surprised me. I know that most people buy it and it is difficult to use it. If there is no factory-sponsored technician to give pointers, they can only stand by and worry. Don't mention the transformation. With this ability alone, your half feet have already embarked on the podium of the lifetime honor explorer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More, thank you Your praise," Rex exclaimed. "It took me half a year to figure out how to control it. If you need it, I can give you a diving suit first, and the price is not bad at all." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you misunderstood, I don't need your diving suit," Roland smiled. "In fact, as long as I think, I can make better." Come."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex A blink of an eye, did not seem to expect'll get a reply. He opened his mouth slyly, as if he wanted to squeeze out a smile, "Your Majesty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roland interrupted him directly, "You may think I am bragging, but that doesn't matter. What I really want is a wonderful thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person couldn’t help but stunned, "I don't understand you." "..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know what you want to prove, and I can help achieve this." Roland straightforwardly said, "The Sage of the World There are two kinds of learning: stargazing and alchemy--aside from the former, I don’t think that what you do is fundamentally different from alchemy. It is all about creating new things for human beings. So why can’t you treat the things as the third? What kind of sages are you learning, and what kind of industry associations are established?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex’s breathing suddenly increased, and he suddenly realized this. The meaning of the words - if you change this to others, he will only feel that he is a sly, even a mockery. Compared to the famous Alchemists Association and Star Alliance, the odd things will not be worth mentioning. But the king of the Grey Fort is different. In terms of his fame and momentum, this is not a impossible thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swallowed and felt that his throat was a little hoarse. "What...what is the price?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the other party intends to help the strange thing to be named, it is impossible to have no picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What...?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
