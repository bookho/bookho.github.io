			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flat and spacious stone boat slowly sailed into Clear Water Bay and docked in front of Simbadi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its size is very different from those of the small boats that occasionally appear in Yinchuan. It is so heavy that it is almost impossible for humans to move. There are two metal cylinders on the top, white smoke is coming out, and the side is painted with striking orange-red, and with a flat gray deck, it looks like a red-headed squid with a belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, like most of his compatriots, has never seen a desert and rarely seen the sea, so he saw such a vessel that was obviously not made of wood. At the time, the amazement was involuntarily issued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team suddenly got some commotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啪!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aosha’s caretaker immediately slammed their heads Whip, "Give me a mouth shut! Now line up on the boat, move faster!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbad feels the crowd is starting to flow, and people are constantly pushing behind He can't do it even if he wants to stop. Sandwiched in the boarding team, he suddenly gave birth to a hint of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you shouldn’t leave the Yinchuan Oasis at all, and come to this strange land – although there are water sources that will never be cut off, the Three Gods are afraid I can't look at such a distant place. If the ship carries them to the abyss of the Styx, the gods will not hear their cry for help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hold me, be careful, don't step on the air!" Murray's voice made him instantly return to God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small hand clasped his palm and guided him to the springboard, and from time to time someone was squeezed into the water, making a plop-sounding sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there will be people on the dockside who will pull them ashore quickly, falling into the river in this weather basically means losing the qualification for "work". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The those who fell in water pleaded for a resurgence of the ship and answered them with a whip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbad and Molly clung together, as the crowd climbed the stone boat. When his feet stepped on the deck, the expected shaking did not appear, and the hull underneath did not move, as if walking on the ground was generally stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the springboard was withdrawn, the big man of the Aosha clan, Thuram, appeared on the high platform in the middle of the ship, attracting everyone’s attention. Remember what I said before? The big chief is most interested in order and discipline! You guys who fall into the water - everyone can go on board and get a job, you can also Evil moons get plenty of food, but now they have to go hungry until the next job opportunity! And all this is caused by your stupidity!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "They just fell into the water, you can wait for them to put on a dress again-" A sandman just said half, was stopped by two caretakers, then dragged to the boat and lost Under the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Discipline is everything! There is no individual group, only the individual who obeys the group!" Thuram snapped. "The difference with the past clan competition is that before Those who have been eliminated are your potential enemies, and those who are now eliminated will be your loved ones! Remember, this is my first lesson for you!" He said that it was paused here, "Of course People who have lost their jobs today will only be hungry for a while. If there are still sand people or tribes who do not know how to obey the order, they will be driven out of this evergreen land!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As his voice fell, a loud voice spurted out of the metal cylinder and rolled over the clear water port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge iron wheels on both sides of the hull slowly rotate, and the stone boat trembles, slowly leaving the shore and heading for the estuary of the river. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, if it wasn't for you..." Sinbad looked to Molly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter smiled and his eyes bent into a slit. "Don't care, I just happened to be in front of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
