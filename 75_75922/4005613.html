			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland arranged the duel and returned to the castle at dusk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it really okay?" Just stepped into the office, the nightingale appeared from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She has been practicing the shooting with lightning, and lightning is the disciple you personally taught. What are you worried about?" Roland comforted. "Last Exploring the critical moments of the Devil's Camp, she dared to turn the beast into the devil, which proved that she did not lack courage. The only question was whether she would shoot at the same kind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;; Mai Mai was shocked more than the pain at the time, Yi Fei did not mean to squat, but this attitude of non-combat witches is extremely contemptuous to put in the team is a bomb, not to impress each other The lesson, let her change the former, Roland simply did not dare to take her out to catch the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to learn is to let Mai Hao beat Effie personally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, the ability to exceed the ability limit, so that the auxiliary witch also has the power of a gun is a gun - in order to avoid accidental death, Roland specifically let Soroya made a batch of rubber bullets, and the metal warheads were replaced with layers of coatings that gradually softened from the inside out. The bullets could not be drilled into the human body, but the power could not be underestimated. Huge kinetic energy is transmitted to the human body as the warhead deforms, and the intense pain is enough to make the target lose its resistance. Therefore, it is also called a disability bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...I will go see her again," the nightingale seemed to be uneasy and broke into the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland gently spit out the gas. When Iffey started on the wheat, he clearly heard the snoring of the pistol from the side of the body, if the other party did not If you let go of the wheat, I am afraid that Nanawa can only be called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the subsequent appeasement, it can be seen that Mai Hao is quite jealous of the witches of the bloody teeth, which means that they are not doing similar on the sleeping island. thing. Think of the previous Harakka, and then think about the inferiority of Evelyn and the candlelight when they first arrived here, even the Witch Federation more than 400 years ago. The concept of this witch is more noble. Suddenly produced. It can be said that in the face of external enemy oppression, capable fighters will inevitably have a higher right to speak. Unfortunately, the power of gunpowder and guns is enough to smooth out the gap caused by the ability... He thought, if you can correct these two people, Tilly should also trust himself more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Do not worry too much, directly aim at the guy to blow the nest in one go, let her cry and scream, beg for mercy, understand?" Lightning shouted, "Even if it is a normal bullet, there is also Na Nava looked at it later, not to mention that you used the paint warhead made by Soloya, not to hit her several times, and did not get rid of it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh..." McGee leaned on the bed and his hair covered his cheeks. "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't know!" Her long white hair, "Now you don't even think about hurting each other's heart, right? If you let her go this time, I will never take you to explore again - the explorer does not need cowards!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;麦茜面露豫色, "I am not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is not a coward, "Another voice rang from behind the two. "The timid person can't fight the devil. Moreover, she saved my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale was out of the fog, went to the bed and forced the forehead of lightning. "Where are you talking?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl hugged her forehead and snorted. "I am just afraid that she will retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;She sighed and took Mickey’s hand. “Listen well, this contest is not simply a matter between you and her... Your arrangement is to let the witch of the bloody party wake up. Mistakes, thus changing their attitude towards other witches. Remember Evelyn and candlelight, witches with similar experiences still have a lot in sleeping islands, if you can give each other a lesson, in a sense, Helping them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." McMug fluttered his eyes and nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Roland also said that if you win this time, ice cream and pepper barbecue will not be available for one week, only for you alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Her eyes suddenly glowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On the second day, in addition to the guards responsible for clearing the field, there were more than a dozen witches on the grass outside the city wall. They gathered around Roland, and the sound of the wheat sizzling was almost one-sided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't cheer for you," Yu Yu yawned. "You can't hear it anyway."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Iphi slowly walked to the center of the circle, and looked coldly at the wheat bran, which was covered with long hair, and sneered in her heart. If there are more people to support, the church will have unified the entire continent. "Now I still have time to give up... otherwise I can’t afford to wait for my expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won’t lose!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but glimpse, when did this guy dare to speak in front of himself with such a positive tone? "Is it? Then you are ready to be caged and then fall from the sky and throw a dog mud."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You shut down Live in me," Mai said in the first place, "The one who can catch me in the sky, only lightning!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the whistle of the duel, Yi The Philippine no longer talk nonsense, rushing straight toward the other side - she thought very clearly, even if the wheat scorpion with the stone of the gods, it is impossible to win the self-training training. One of Roland’s sorrows is wrong. Fighting witches are not simply relying on their own abilities to fight, throwing away their abilities, and their bodies are equally deadly weapons. Using physical fitness and resilience to surpass the characteristics of ordinary people, witches can often withstand more bloody and rigorous training, even if the other party is a fully armed knight, she also has the confidence to win each other within ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mai Mai changed into a blue bird, quickly spread his wings and flew toward the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this your way of fighting?" Iphie extended her arm in the direction of her escape, but the magic of shooting did not capture the target, "This is Duel, where can you escape?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“唧——唧——” The birds are getting higher and higher, and they soon disappeared. Leave a string of crisp tweets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ifei frowned and looked up at the sky. Suddenly, she saw a glimpse of the shadow in the direction of the sun rising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use light to conceal the figure to initiate an unexpected attack? Effie can't help but sneer, but the idea is to play well. Unfortunately, her ability doesn't need to see the target directly. Even if it is blindfolded, any target that enters the ten-step range will be touched by magic. Her ability to wake up in adulthood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, what harm does a fist-sized bluebird give her? If you want to win the game, the other party will definitely change the behemoth of the beggar again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as she waited, a cloud covered the sun, and the earth instantly darkened. At that moment, Iphi saw the bird descending from the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor worm, it seems that even luck is not on your side! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not hesitate to reach out and grab the other side - the victory and defeat have been divided! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing... The magic surrounds her front, but she doesn’t feel the smashing into the wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 suddenly stopped at a distance of twenty steps away from her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Iphie was surprised that she changed back to the human form in midair and pulled a silver short stick out of her waist pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She... is it crazy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
