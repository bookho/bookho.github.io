			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merchant fleet sailed north along the tributary of the Chishui River and passed through the Yinguang City and sailed into the Grand Canal leading to the capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa remembers that he was seen in the Chronicles of the Grey Fort, and it was still a wasteland two hundred years ago. In order to transport the silver mines mined from nearby mines back to Wangdu, Wimbledon I called the stonemason and nearly 10,000 handymen. It took twenty years to build this canal connecting Wangdu and the silver mine, and the surrounding areas of the silver mine gradually formed. A city was later named the Silver City by the first king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the scene displayed in front of him is difficult to associate with the wasteland two hundred years ago. The banks of the canal are dense farmland, and further away, It is a village that is connected into pieces. This made him think of the Kingdom Road in Bianbu Town. When the road is repaired, I am afraid that the foot of the mountain will become dense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you used to be a king of the world?" A woman’s voice rang from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa turned his head and found that it was the owner of the caravan, Margaret, who nodded. "Before becoming a palace guard, I have lived in the inner city." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How does it feel to return to the place?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To be honest, okay," He said, "If it weren't for the arrangement of His Royal Highness, I would rather stay in Bianbu Town. Although the Wangdu is prosperous, it has a feeling of poor breathing." This is especially true for the bottom nobles, Tassa thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Margaret smiled. "How much do you know about Your Royal Highness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" This question gave him a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think he is an incredible person. It is clear that the style of the king is very poor. You should have heard a lot of rumors about him, but in Bentham Town... It’s not like the rumors, no matter the behavior or the idea is unpredictable,” she paused. “If the steam engine is just a testimony of his knowledge, why can he even train him? Are the fighters so different?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tassa glanced at the first soldiers who sat on the deck - considering that activities should be done near the kingdom It may be hidden. They are not equipped with muskets, nor are they wearing uniform uniforms. Instead, they are replaced with a variety of leather armors, carrying a wooden gun behind them, which looks like a caravan of the caravan. Most of them were away from the West for the first time. Although they were curious and looked around and talked about it, no one took off their shoes or laid down their weapons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverse view of the mercenary mercenaries, many of them have already entered the cabin in order to avoid the sun, and the three or four people who remain on the deck take off their shoes and will The handicapped weapon was released and placed aside, lying flat in the shade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know too much," Tassa reluctantly beaten. It's not that he wants to hide, but he doesn't know it - since the Four Princes arrived in Bianbu Town, it has become very different from before. "Probably His Royal Highness has been pretending to be himself."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... is this?" Margaret was undecided about this answer. She was silent for a moment and suddenly extended her finger to the front. "Look, that is the wall of the kingdom, we are coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sinuous blue-gray at the end of the field of vision. Just standing here, you can feel the grandeur of the wall - this is the most outstanding before the stonemason will be disbanded. The work, whether it is height or thickness, is second to none in the Grey Fort. I heard that there are even rooms and passages inside the wall, which can accommodate nearly a thousand soldiers to rest, thus achieving no-interval patrol and fast support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wall was clearly presented in front of Tassa, the figure of the fugitive also entered his vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of civilians gathered outside the suburbs of Wangdu. They built a simple shed along the city wall. The fire in front of the shed was white smoke and seemed to be cooking. Wheat porridge. For the time being, these people have not yet broken their food, and their looks are not bad. However, Wang Du's relief food will certainly not be endlessly distributed. When the nobles select the right labor force, they will send troops to drive away these people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you going to do?" Margaret curiously said, "Do you send your soldiers to promote the people?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, it’s so inefficient, and it’s easy to get noticed by others,” Tassa shook his head. “Want to do things in the king’s office, either buy an official or hire a mouse, you should This is deeply understandable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
