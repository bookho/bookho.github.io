			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since becoming the maid of Joel on the 76th, he has found that Dennis has had fewer fun to find. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not because you have forgotten old love, but he has to take the time to look after the poor guide – “black money” The punishment was not a joke. When she was sent over by the person in charge, she was covered with whip marks and bruises everywhere, and she was judged by the appearance of half a day ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yu Qingqing forgot to make this request in time, otherwise he will continue to fight like this. On the 76th, I am afraid I will be killed alive, so the silver will tell her. It is no longer possible to act as a guide - the guests naturally will not let a disabled person serve themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good on the 76th, the body is quite strong, not as weak as the average woman, especially the abdomen and back, but also can see the shallow muscles The lines, after the wounds were finished, quickly recovered, and now they can manage the chores in the house - of course, some small personal services. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, need me to help you press your shoulders?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;76 After cleaning the house, I came close and smiled and sat down to Joel. According to the rules, without the owner’s instructions, the maid could not take the initiative to be close to the owner. The other party apparently still pleaded with the "black money" training method. The guests". However, Joel did not care at all. On the contrary, he liked this kind of initiative and passionate teasing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she is just a maid who is disciplined and follows the master's orders, it is too boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit up," he put down his wild history and lie down on the bench, and on the 76th he took off his shoes and kneeled and let him Hold your head firmly on your thigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then her slender and powerful fingers pressed against her shoulders and slowly kneaded - compared to those women who had more massage than ** It is much heavier and more skillful. Obviously, after some hard work, it can really relieve fatigue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About lying on her lap, I can clearly see the face of the 76th. After the "black money" sent her over, she naturally did not need to wear the bronze mask to cover her identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, the 76th is not a particularly beautiful woman. It’s only moderately high on the five senses, not to mention the witch. It is. But the red lips are just right, especially when he looks up from below, the corner of the corner can be particularly interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's even more beautiful is her figure - Joel is still the first to experience a woman with such power, she is not like most noble women Feng Wei, not as thin as a poor girl. Well-proportioned limbs, elastic skin, and bumpy chest and abdomen... When she is tight, she can feel the firm muscles of a slight uplift. For him who likes fresh, it is more attractive than pure looks. too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Joel planned to go further with the other party, the door was pushed open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the Hill is Fox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the time of the fun ends here, he sighed and sat up. "I won’t let me save the witch again this time?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill did not answer, but looked to the 76th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter smugly bowed and then hurried out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a servant," Joel shrugged. "You are too cautious."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The situation in the morning is not stable, so be careful at this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dennis is better than seven in terms of reputation and family. The 16th is much bigger, why can't you be so wary of her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because Denise Payton is a person on the table, can pass Various means to find out the details, but a guide for "black money" training can not be found. Hill sat down opposite him and placed a letter on the coffee table in the middle.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
