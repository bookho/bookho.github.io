			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fortress, the palace underground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco sat obliquely on the throne, his right hand on his cheek, and looked slightly impatiently at the hall to perform his assassination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first idiot after winter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably because I was too tolerant, let the clowns come together one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He yawned and felt his eyes dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the temple was blown up by snow powder, he moved the venue to the basement of the palace. After some renovations, several storage rooms were connected into one piece, and the space was not too small enough to accommodate the ministers and nobles who attended the meeting. The most important thing is that the place is absolutely safe. There is only one entrance and exit. The top is a magnificent palace. No amount of snow powder will affect this place. The disadvantage is that there is no light in the ground, and the light source is all provided by the turpentine torch. The torch around the wall made the indoor air extremely dry and dull, and the sweet smell of the rosin made him sleepy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After thinking of the fourth brother, Tiefco hated his teeth. If there were no witnesses who noticed that the other’s attack came from heaven, he might still Dagu builds a sentry tower. Since he knows that this means can't be defended at all, he can only hold a meeting here temporarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland. Wimbledon will pay for it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected Majesty," the voice of the recruiter pulled his thoughts back into the hall. "Look, as long as the rebel Roland dared to appear in front of me, I You can complete the mission you entrusted!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faceco glanced at the other side and saw that four flying knives were accurately inserted in him. Step on the wooden barrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what you call stunt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case, squat," he Confidence said, "I don't want you to say that I have done this business before, and there are no fewer than ten mice in my hands. If you shoot in the crowd, most of the targets don't know where the flying knife is from. Come out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remuneration?" Tiefko moved some stiff body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as twenty-five golden dragons," the recruiter licked his fingers, "five for the cost of the road, and the cost of dressing up - dressed up The unobtrusive appearance is easier to get close to the rebel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Weimas," the king gestured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty." The Steel Knight pulled out the sword and took the shield from behind and walked into the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean by you?" He groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By defeating my knight, I will give you the reward." Tiefko made a look at the Jazz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter nodded, pulled the lower armor and walked toward the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait, wait... No, squat, this won't work," said the recruiter, turning over and avoiding the knight's slash, stammering. "I can't be positive - ah!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers then kicked a kick in his abdomen, causing him to swallow all the rest of the story. Go back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After rolling two laps on the ground, the recruiter softly throws a flying knife, but it is easily blocked by the shield. Then the jazz stepped on his hand and the sword fell. The half arm suddenly left his body, and the splashed blood reflected an arc on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My hand--" the other side made a scream, holding his arm and shrinking into a ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, the royal family is no better than a mouse. Even my stupid younger brother will not easily approach the crowd. Second, you can’t even help a knight. What do you want to assassinate the lords who have many knight guards around you? I am afraid that once you get twenty-five golden dragons, you will never come back here." Tiefco waved his hand and "throw him out." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
