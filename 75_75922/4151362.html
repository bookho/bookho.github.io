			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the room of the Greenland Sanatorium, the Fijian language locked the door and took out the recorder embedded in the decorative piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost only the size of the rice, and it does not have a playback function. It needs to be inserted into a special reader to hear the recorded content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After passing the data into the notebook, she found the audio closest to Wakiris’s moment to leave the contest, and clicked the play button. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"滋滋滋..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We met again, Vakiris Miss." Roland’s voice sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished the cold and curled up his mouth and gave himself a cup of hot tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She decided to enjoy the long-awaited results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steaming tea gradually cools down until it becomes cold again, tea The owner did not have time to take a sip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she had a hunch, she found that what she had learned was far more than she had imagined! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the stop button was pressed, Fiji found that his fingertips were shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a runaway for a well-known martial artist! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She now finally understands why Roland, who is a hunter, will crack the glass in his hand at that dinner party - if it involves the secret of the gods, It’s not normal to be shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreams that have been created, the civilizations that fight for survival, the connections and continuations of the two worlds, the guardians who travel through the conscious world, and more Unbelievable things? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original two chose to talk in the coffee shop to disappoint the Fijian language, but after listening to it, she realized that the content was splendid, others It will only be considered as nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, Fiji’s chill does not think that the two are guilty, if the latter is disguised from the day she observes Roland in secret, That is too exaggerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the world is really created by humans, then she is probably the first person to spy on the truth behind the scenes-<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..." Fiji whispered out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feels really...so satisfying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the "fiction or truth" that the god asked, she did not care. No one knows better than herself, she is a living being. Whether it's a gesture of giving up, or every thought that comes out of my mind, comes from her personal will, and the same is true of this time to actively explore the secrets of outsiders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps Roland is one of the creators of the world, but what about it? If the planet is created by cosmic energy and elementary particles, then there is no essential difference in replacing the former with someone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished in the chair, letting the body tremble slightly and enjoy the long-lost happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the excited mood gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to say that the key information about the destruction of the world by the gods and the nature of the demon should be reported to the martial arts association, but because of the large It was almost possible to rewrite history, so she decided to observe it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, she did not receive any tangible evidence in addition to the conversation between the two. And now it can't be ruled out, both of them are likely to be addicted to severe snoring. From the second year of junior high school, there is a chance to generate telepathy, and the urban legend that can resonate among the same kind of people, she also heard about it, although the probability of this situation is extremely low, but it cannot be prevented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is most interesting to Fiji is now another world in which the two were originally located. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, those who call Roland as their Majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they can come to the dream world, can they look at the world over there? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and see the so-called...reality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you go," Garcia looked dissatisfied Roland, "Say good to accompany the cleansing to see the game?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry... there is something to tell the association, and I have no way." After touching the back of the head, this matter is his first loss, so he is very decisive. In order to open the time of returning with Wajilis, he deliberately stayed in the restaurant for a while, but did not expect to hit the peak of the evening after work, the result is that the two waited for half an hour at the gate of the martial arts hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it weren’t for me that I had a patrol mission, I would have left you alone." Garcia didn’t have a good air, "Take a girl to eat." Good compensation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She patted the brain of Jieluo, who nodded and ran to Roland’s side, and returned to Garcia.躬 , , "Thank you sister!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he is treating you harshly, be sure to tell me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is so pretending to be so clever in front of outsiders. Roland couldn't help but swear, but the face was sincere. "Reassured, wrapped in me. Right, do you want to bring you a copy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No." Garcia generously waved, "Let's go, I will go back to the martial arts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To trouble you today." Roland and After the other side said goodbye, Chao Jielu shrugged. "Let's go, there is a commercial plaza in front, what you want to eat tonight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well. "Jie Luo sighed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oddly, this time she shouldn’t take the opportunity to open the lion. Roland is a little surprised, how suddenly it has become so quiet? "Why, isn't today's game exciting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it’s better than watching it on TV..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's it. When you come back on holiday, I will take you a few times to see the scene. Anyway, I am also a member of the association. Tickets should not be difficult to get."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crossing the road along the sidewalk, the two people are on the side of the street where people come and go, the snow under the feet has been stepped on, leaving only the sound of "啪唧啪唧" . But there are more snowflakes falling from the night sky, and the neon lights that are flashing are dyed with brilliant colors. In this way, the city should become white again tomorrow morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, Jie Luo fell behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suddenly felt that his clothes were pulled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped and unexpectedly turned his head back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw the little girl with her head down and pulled his clothes without saying a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong..." Roland groaned. "Hey, it's not right to be with you, but work..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo shook his head, "I... don't want to go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"啥?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to go back to my hometown, my uncle." She looked up and bit her lip. "I can continue to live with you during the two months of vacation? I will find a way to get it." I used to buy food, but now it’s definitely faster, and I’m sure I won’t be in arrears. I...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the little girl who seems to have courage Roland couldn’t speak for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
