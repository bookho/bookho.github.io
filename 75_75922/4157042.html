			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham suddenly felt a whirlwind, his ears filled with metal twists, steam spurts and Hank’s screams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moment seems to be extremely long, and when the carriage finally settles, his body is lying next to the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the limbs still obeyed his command, turned over, probed, climbed, and the whole process did not encounter any obstacles, which means he was basically intact. - Nothing is better than escaping a derailment accident, even if it is only temporary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, man, are you okay?" He groped around Hank with the smoke and water vapor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh...should be fine," Hank yelled. "God is on, what the hell is going on?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evil beast destroyed the railroad track, we must hurry out of here." Cham patted his shoulder. "I don't know which city you came from, but remember that there is no winter." The gods will not protect you. Only the King’s Majesty and this rifle can protect you. Now go with me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climb out of the front of the window, he looks By the time the entire train had been smashed, the carriages fell vertically below the roadbed, forming a curved fold line. However, it is probably because of the deceleration before the derailment, the car did not appear much damage, basically remains the same, many people are pushing the doors and windows spontaneously, trying to climb out of the car from these holes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Cham heard a crisp shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snorted and turned his head to Hank. "Listen, you are going to help everyone get out of trouble, then take them to the west to retreat!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the train, the risk of moving to Site 1 is too great, and here you can see the outline of the hidden forest - just run into the land of the leaf adult It should be able to get rid of the pursuit of evil beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, I know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See each other nod, Chammy opens his legs Fly up above the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has to hurry to find Xia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last carriage, Chalm found that the militia team was fighting with a few wolves that had caught up, they had left a few bodies, but still I don’t want to climb the roof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the insurance and fired at the distance of less than ten meters - although this was the first time he had pulled the trigger to the enemy, but the past The training made him quickly find the feeling, and in a short while he helped the militia to kill him all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, before he took a breather and asked everyone where the witch was, the ground suddenly trembled! The shells that fell on the car body slid down and made a slamming sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this shock reached its peak, the land in front of it suddenly rose, a huge worm broke out, and the bloody mouth slammed into the crowd. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hell, what is this?" The militia exclaimed the trigger, and the monster was suddenly beaten, but it was bigger than that. The body, the trauma caused by bullets is not fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worm's epidermis swells up, and Chalm can even see the pulsating cyan blood vessels underneath - with a nausea squirming, a group of bodies covered The evil beast of mucus was spit out of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham can hardly believe his eyes, and there are such strange monsters among the evil beasts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at this time he has not been able to marvel at it. Most of the new evil beasts are mixed. When they are scattered, the unlucky one must be Yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open fire, fire!" He fired at the enemy while reminding him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence also awakened the militia team, they used the train as a bunker, pouring firepower from the gap to the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first sight of it, Chalm’s heart was half cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a monster that has only been heard in his father’s mouth – the thick fangs and the four-legged hands indicate that it’s the rumored hell fear. It is also the most difficult enemy to deal with in the mixed species. There are only a handful of times that there are no winter borders, and the ordinary firearms can't stop it from attacking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the tortoise tears open the worm's mouth, it raises the fangs and rushes toward the train! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham jumped subconsciously to the ground, almost at the same time, the enemy slammed into the carriage, and let the heavy car body slide - two too late The militia members who were opened were tripped to the ground by the carriage, and were directly smashed by the car body. The screams did not make a sound and became a sloppy flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fearful beast is also difficult to move because the fangs are deep in the iron. Others have fired at the target, but it is useless except for making the former more arrogant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a slender figure rushed into the battlefield - it was clearly a human woman, and this scene also made everyone involuntarily raised the muzzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Danger, let go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham knows each other at a glance Debating and debut, "Possan!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw that Poshan ignored the warnings of everyone, and a leaping tumbling directly rushed into the belly of the fearful beast. This made Cham suddenly hang over the eyes of the blind, as long as one is not careful, she will be trampled under the feet to form a meat sauce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posnan probably knows this too, as she follows the footsteps of the monsters and stretches out and grabs the other side - the thick fur begins to be visible to the naked eye. Withered, the hell feared beast also made a thrilling howl! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like getting orders, the rest of the evil beasts rushed to this huge monster, whose goal is obviously the witch below. The situation has become extremely dangerous. Once the flexible wolf or raptor is close to Poshan, she will be unable to parry. And this distance shot is very likely to accidentally hurt her, everyone suddenly fell into a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, nothing else! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham clenched his teeth and slammed out of the carriage and ran straight to the struggling beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has changed strangely. Just now the two sides are still in the state of chasing and being chased. Now it has become a way to see who can get to the feared beast faster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bear species evil beast twisted his head and bit him, and he did not avoid the flash and handed the pistol forward-<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get out of the way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment of shooting, the barrel almost reached the target's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a bang, the bear's head was torn apart, crashed down, and Chalm did not look at it, and continued to run straight over its body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the chance of accidental injury, there is no other way than to draw closer! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are morphing goshawks and wild boars at the moment Around them, they risked being flattened by the same kind, biting their mouths at Poshan and trying to push her out of the dead end. And Poshan also knows who is the most threatening target, and keeps the fear of the beast and does not let go, let the body be exposed to the bite of the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of ​​withering soon spread more than half, and Cham also rushed to the front of Possan and was smothered with the evil beast. The Vanner-style rifle without manual loading and large-capacity magazines is undoubtedly advantageous in this moment. Whether it is a thick and wild boar or a combination of wolf and lion, as long as the head is eaten, it is basically a scorpion, a raptor. It is solved directly by the butt. Of course, he was not bitten too much - in order to protect Poshan, sometimes he can only use his body to block the enemy's attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fearful beast finally pulled out its long fangs, but there was little energy left. The power of decay has spread all over the body, and the fur that seems to be indestructible is now stuck into thin paper and can no longer bear the weight of the organ. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
