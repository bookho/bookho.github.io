			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia doesn’t understand what high-energy physics means, and doesn’t quite understand what it’s all about physics, but she’s noticed that every When I saw this plaque, I would stop gazing for a long time, as if it had a strange power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also makes Lucia more active in new work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she did not make much difference in the furnace area, she felt that she might be doing something when she thought of her sire. A big event. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you are coming." Entering the inner court, Lychi, lying on the chair and closing her eyes, raised her hand and said hello to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, good afternoon." Lucia quickly returned to the ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The sun here is mild, and I sleep for a little while without knowing it," Ajima stretched. "Would you like to start working?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. I am bothering you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waved her hand, "What does it not? Trouble, I am your assistant, there is nothing to do and you can do it. It is not the first time to meet, there is no need to see it. Say it again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Akima whispered a whisper, but was still sent to Lucia's ear by the warm autumn wind - "just sit here and you can get the monthly salary of two gold dragons, what else can complain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but cover her mouth. To be honest, at first she was a little afraid of each other. After all, I heard from Wendy that there was a rumor of the internal disharmony of the island, and the initiator was the tall red-haired witch with a strong facial features. Being a leader of a small group naturally has an extraordinary place, and from the point of view of the opponent’s gestures, it does have a big sister’s style. So when Roland’s majesty makes Ajima her assistant, she is quite Why, I always feel that I am not a good person in charge of the new research institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after a few months of contact, Lucia found that the other party was not as terrible as she thought, although there were occasional complaints about His Highness, and even with I will blame my body, but I can work without ambiguity, and it is very suitable for her request, and is particularly sensitive to salary. I often hear such things as "Is not to support myself?", "I will prove it to you", " The nightingale, you are waiting for me, such as the broken thoughts, in short, not as cold as the surface, but a very interesting person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, there is work." Lucia opened the closet and handed the white protective suit to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in the work is to completely isolate the body from the outside world. More than just touching, even breathing requires a special filter. This is a point that has been repeatedly explained by the armpits - the purified items are extremely toxic, and as long as one powder is used, it can kill people. In order to prevent negligence, two people must check each other's wear, especially those that they can't see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After wearing protective clothing, Ajima compared her to her thumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two people walked into an open-air compound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of blue stone bricks is neatly placed on the ground, covered with more than half of the yard, in addition to a lot of color, it looks like the furnace area There is no difference in the bricks that have just been burned out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as long as you are in your hands, you can immediately feel the difference - each stone is extraordinarily solid, as if it were not a stone product, but The same as metal creation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia picks up a piece and puts the magic on it. Because of the long time being baked by the sun, the surface of the stone brick is slightly hot, but this will not Influence her ability to display. Under the magical vision, the bricks turned into a colorful composition, and several of them were very dazzling, as if they were emitting light. The "color blocks" that are needed under the arm are only occupying a very small part, just like a pair of ink spots that are accidentally spilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this is a great improvement over the pile of ore in the North Slope Mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under her drive, the patches move slowly and re-aggregate until they become four separate wholes. The biggest part of the variegated is waste, thrown into the trash can, every day Takira will send people to collect, do not need her to deal with. The remaining three parts, one smaller than the other, the last group of silver-white metal, that is, the poison in the mouth, almost only one salt size. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
