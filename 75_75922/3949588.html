			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky turned bright, Roland yawned into the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally thought it was an easy adult day, I didn’t expect to have so many accidents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the night sees Lucia’s expression is not right, the magic in her body has become arrogant – this is the sign of the magical phagosome, for a regular practice And, in the witches who emptied all the magical powers a few years ago, it was incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution was proposed by Ai Gesha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the former federation who witnessed the awakening of countless witches, she quickly thought of countermeasures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ice Witch lets Speer Passy summon the magic channel to derive the magical power of Lucia's body, which is transferred and reused by Anna, who has the largest capacity. The divine inscriptions absorb this part of the swaying magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprisingly, the magic of the export directly illuminates the four gods and activates the divine signature. Anna did not hesitate for a second and decisively released it to the open area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that moment, the town was illuminated by a golden sun, the glare of light penetrated the walls of the castle, stabbing the sky without stars, thick The clouds are in the shape of the night, and the tens of thousands of tassels are flowing in the top of people's heads. Although it only lasted for a short period of time, the scene at that time was a miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is a happy one - Lucia is finally safe and sound, and also evolved new abilities in this adulthood, exactly the same as Anna a year ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the trouble is not without it. The time of the accident is almost 8:00 pm, most of the people have not yet fallen asleep, and certainly many people have witnessed this wonder. After Roland returned to the room, he had to think about how to explain this phenomenon to the public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, the general manager Barov asked," the guard at the door knocked on the doorway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let him come in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balph with a white hair The office, without a gift, asked directly, "His Royal Highness, what happened last night, why is there a sudden whiteness at night?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this When the road came, Roland glanced at the dark circles on his face and knew that he was not as good as himself. If it is not forbidden to enter and exit the castle after the night, he will probably find the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not worry, sit down and say," the prince pointed to the chair in front of the table. "First drink a cup of black tea."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly poured a cup of hot tea to the other party, he only said about Lucia's adulthood. "This is just an accident, you don't have to worry too much."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So... is this caused by the witch?" The brow of the town hall manager wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don’t think about the devil," Roland quickly guessed the other’s mind, "Nobody except this half-wall is missing from the dilapidated castle. Injured."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the townspeople will think about this," Barov shook his head. "The majority of them accept Miss Nana Wa. The healing power, not the ability to destroy the castle like this, causing the change of the sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I thought of a solution," Roland drank Tea, slowly said, "You will arrange for the men to spread the news: the golden light that appeared last night, because the prince of the prince captured the thunder in the sky, the purpose is naturally to bring light to his people. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Barov groaned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will soon set up a power supply in Bianbu Town, the essence of which is the same as the lightning in the sky," the prince briefly explained a few words, he knows I can't understand the other person. "This set of equipment can make the town bright and bright at night, just in line with the news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
