			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Roland’s plan, once the shelling begins, it will not stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first five rounds of volley will be the first row of twenty evil beasts into powder, followed by free shooting time, using the empty bomb to open fire quickly, with The detonation of the black gunpowder made an imposing manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the sound of the shooting continued to sound, the atmosphere of the scene ushered in a new climax, the explosion of smoke and mud, the 500 meters The area seems to be coming to an end. Occasionally, the cage was shattered by a splash of stone. The first reaction of the evil beast in the cage was not to rush to the wall, but to turn back and flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear defeated their instinct for bloodthirsty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that there are very few fish that can escape the death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the strong shock wave from the ground, their internal organs have already ruptured and displaced, and the eardrum and the eyeball have lost their sensory function. Most of the evil beasts are not gone. How far away will it fall to the ground and be swallowed up by the newly detonated explosives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not a big deal, you have never seen the war with the church," Andrea squinted and stunned to the stunned wolf. The heart witches said loudly, "At that time, although there were only two cannons, there were still hundreds of guns and small ones. The opponents were not the evil beasts in the cage, but the action was quick and powerful. Infinite God's penalty force. When it hits the most intense time, the entire open space is a flying projectile. As long as it is outcrop, it is a dead end. Compared to this, it is called a real war."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, is that the case..." Amy looked shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder they will lose," the hero sighed. "This is not something that people can resist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "When you see such a scene, are you not afraid at all?" Broken sword admiredly looked at Andrea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter squatting in the gap between the explosions, gracefully and geographically fluttering long hair, "Of course, you will get used to it when you see more. I have witnessed the war." Throughout the process, I also personally killed two gods and penalties!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She completely forgot that when she first boarded the city wall, she was also full of them. Surprised and unbelievable, now there are some tastes of the absence of the winter city as a second home. Even when talking about these weapons, there is a sense of pride in the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice’s observations are much more detailed than most of the busy witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first row of evil beasts was smashed, she was not too concerned about it - the spear of the madman in this distance Can threaten the soldiers on the wall, face the spears falling in the storm, even if these weapons called the fortress guns are amazing, how long can the mortals who manipulate it last? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the fire turned to the second row of cages, her look finally changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it true that the mortal king’s intention to arrange evil beasts is to make the explosion advance step by step? The last row of cages is almost outside the Baizhang. If the fortress can hit the area, it means that its range is almost equal to that of the siege beast, but the lethality is far superior to the latter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The siege beast has always been the most difficult devil weapon of the Federation, because its attack distance is farther than any trebuchet or brake, resulting in only each occurrence. It can rely on the superior to lead the holy army to attack the enemy's position, even if it succeeds in destroying the siege beast, it will bring no small casualties. If the witches have such long-range strike weapons, they will not be able to keep the holy city of Taqila. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the killer of the Winter City, and the reason why Ai Gesha is full of confidence in Roland? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After she asked this question to the Ice Witch, the other party just shook her head with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put it a kilometer away, just to meet the needs of the audience... because it will affect the appreciation of the exercise. As for the new artillery The range, Roland said that it can be more than ten kilometers, which is ten times now." Ai Gesha said in her ear, "in other words, it can hit the place that the manipulator can't see."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
