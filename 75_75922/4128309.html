			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guide and contact immediately declined the invitation, especially the former, and unconsciously moved to a position away from the entrance, if not stared by the soldiers, I am afraid I have long since lost the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rother did not choose to wear that weird dress. "I don't have to, leave a copy as a spare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you sure?" Sean frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The disciplinary warrior's resistance and self-healing ability are much stronger than mortals. The general evils and poisons are ineffective for us. I don't think one can Letting a mortal person suffer from a decade of disease can threaten the body of God, and this is the most common thing in the ruins.” She shrugged. “On the contrary, this coverall will make me inconvenient, the perception declines, unknown. Wearing it in the field is undoubtedly self-contained, so it is still exempt. Besides, if we really encounter the dilemma of having a dilemma, there is a set of spare clothes, so that outsiders can be rescued - although this happens to be minimal. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very good reason. The god of punishment can only rely on sight and hearing to perceive the environment, so it is also very dependent on it. Hundreds of years of training have allowed them to judge the moisture and flexibility of the soil even by stepping on the ground, which has been seen on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, for the average person, it is only a slight protective cover for the ears and eyes, and the impact on the god witch is probably much more serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What if it is a curse of the gods?" Akima worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rother laughed—just like the previous smile, the corner of his mouth was awkward. “Don’t say if a leather can resist the gods, if there is Let it be directed at me. I would like to see that when a million Taqila people are buried in the fertile plains, the gods can curse us again!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," Shaun nodded for a moment and then nodded. "Let's go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Akima took a deep breath, Followed by the guards and got into the stone gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no imaginary damp inside the ruins. The sand that penetrates from the entrance occupies most of the passage. At first, everyone can only bow and walk, but with Gradually deepening, the passage becomes a little bit more spacious. Although it is still going down, the slope is much smoother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shining range of the torch, you can see that the stone walls on both sides are damaged seriously, and the roots and plant vines are separated by layers of bricks. The outside extends in and is blocked in the passage. Russell, who was at the forefront, cut it with a handful of axe and cut it out for everyone. If it is not a god-destroyed witch, it is estimated that this downhill road will take a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This has indeed been abandoned for a long time, but it is not exactly like what Naf said, because the team was cursed and closed," Sean said suddenly. "At least for a while, it should be people coming and going."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you see?" Rother curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a torch groove on the wall." He pointed to the wall. "The texture of the perforated surface is much clearer than the wall, indicating that the time between the two is very different. Far. If they only temporarily hide from the rain, they don’t have to leave a torch every ten steps.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, It is only necessary to open the torch groove if it is necessary to have frequent and long-term access to the site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I will say, as long as there is a baby, how can the local lord not be interested?" Rother sneered twice. "The mortal guide is not It must be lying, but the rumor itself has been processed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What I am worried about is what you are looking for, will it be him? Baby in the mouth...” Sean said, “If there are many sources, how many have been shipped away in the past 100 years, and where have they been shipped? According to His Majesty, that is the key to creating the sun’s glory. Don't let it fall into the hands of others."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These questions have to wait until Miss Achilla takes us to the first source before we can conclude." Serge’s body suddenly turned a little, “...I think we should be not far from the goal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
