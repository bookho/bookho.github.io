			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Brian woke up, the first thing that caught his eye was the gray ceiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shining through the window is a bit glaring, he closes his eyes slightly, then opens, and the scene in front of him still remains unchanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a dream, he thought, I... still alive? He tried to move his body, only to find that he could only shake his fingers, and his whole body seemed to be hollowed out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he heard someone shouting. "He woke up and went to inform His Highness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;His Royal Highness? Brian felt like a mess in his head, and his thoughts were much slower than usual. By the way, how did you faint? It seems that the snake has pierced the chest and will soon die. At the last moment, a ghostly woman suddenly appears, destroying all the enemies in an incredible way...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Soon a waitress reached out and lifted him up, sitting on the bed. The other person came to the basin and helped him clean the face. Brian apparently did not experience such a full-fledged service, plus some young maids around him, which made him feel a little helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this crampedness did not last long. When the four princes entered the room, everyone bent down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian is feeling that a hot heart is surging. He has too many words to ask, but Zhang does not know what to say first. Roland nodded and said, "I know you about your deeds, Brian, you are a well-deserved hero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "hero" is exported, Brian suddenly felt sore eyes and his voice choked. "No... Your Highness, my friend is real..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland patted him Shoulder to show comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As predicted by the Nightingale, after the fierceness was dragged to the torture room, all the things that were known were explained without waiting for the warden’s hands to turn the beans. Out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behind-the-scenes master of this team is not his brother Wang, but the elk family of the long-song fortress. The Earl of Elk was associated with the distant relatives of Hills Meade, which was the fierce, and controlled most of the patrols through seduction and differentiation. In addition, he also sent a good hand to replace the team to fill the insurance, in case of accidents during the operation. The purpose of this group of people is not to assassinate themselves, but to burn down the pure grain so that they can roll back to the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This conspiracy caused the death of an innocent person - the Greyhound. He tried to stop the criminal attempt of the fierce group and was stabbed to death by the patrol team. The player who replaced the viper was unknown. It was probably that the castle did not catch fire in the morning. The fierceness did not come back on time and realized that the plan was revealed and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Brian’s mood stabilized, Roland said, “Your friend Greyhound, he will get a funeral that suits his identity. His family will also Being properly placed, there is no need to worry about food in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you, Your Highness," Brian took a deep breath. "Is it fierce... Is he dead too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is still alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol captain is painfully closed With his eyes on, he would rather not be saved, but also drag the other party to hell. But this hope has become awkward... There is no doubt that fierceness is sinful, but the sins committed by the nobility can be redeemed with money. As long as his uncle is willing to protect him, the fierceness is likely to die. . Even the prison will not enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland naturally guessed his thoughts, "Hills Mead, that is, the fierceness in your mouth, he is the one of the long-song fortress elk family The man in charge of the family called Lockkin Mead, the count of the Duke of Ryan, is also his distant uncle..." He said that he paused a little later, "but these will not affect the final verdict, and the fierceness has already He was sentenced to death and was executed three days later. If you can recover, you may wish to take a look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian suddenly widened his eyes, "but . . . But your Highness, the nobility can use the Golden Dragon to redeem sin, and you will not be angry with this—"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland waved his hand and motioned him to be safe," Aristocrats? Perhaps for you, he was born in a family of elk, and his status is different from that of you. But in fact, he has neither a title nor a land, and he is not a nobleman. Second, even if he is a noble, invade The prince’s palace, in vain, burned the grain, regardless of the life and death of more than 2,000 people in Bianbu Town. It is a sin can not be forgiven "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;</div>
