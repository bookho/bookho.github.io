			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faceless person feels a chill in the body, how...how is it possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swallowed and lowered her voice. "You are making a joke, I am Volt."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s impossible to happen, the other person just knows himself, there are so many mercenaries in the camp, can she remember that everyone’s name is not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect a sneer from behind, "Is it? I never knew that men can also gather magic. Or, you are mixed into the camp. The witch, either, is an extremely rare wizard. But no matter which answer, it is impossible to say the "Volt" you said. In the soldiers of the First Army, there is no such thing as yours. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person... can see the power of the demon? Afra heart has sunk to the bottom, she knows why she was discovered, the witch in the camp There are more than four people, and the woman behind him is also a witch, and has the ability to look like the real eye. In the church's magical sacred code, this ability has been recorded - it is hundreds of derivatives One, does not conflict with the main ability.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t see anyone close to me, then...the main ability of the other person is to hide the figure?<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now kneel, hands back to the back, I can spare you a life," she said, "do what I said!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mercenaries are still fighting in the periphery, not paying attention to this scene in the central open space, but the four witches beside the campfire have already noticed the anomaly here. In the situation, I have cast my eyes on it. "What happened to the night, what happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last chance. Afra is aware that he is good at assassination rather than frontal fighting, especially if he does not wear the stone of punishment." In this case, the witch who is capable of dealing with the ability is not dominant. The flying witch can run away, but the witch who can cure the evil must die here, otherwise she will pose a serious threat to the church's plan.<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there is still a possibility, that is, after killing the other party, I will not be able to escape. I can’t help but think of it here, but it quickly turns to be calm--the church In order to unify the four kingdoms and do everything in their power to resist the devil from hell, many excellent fighters have been sacrificed. If she can fill in this goal, it is also a matter of pride.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She believes that Heather will not forget himself, and will have his own name in the future holy scriptures.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't come over first," behind The witch, known as the Nightingale, shouted, "Here is -" < Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she suddenly got into trouble, turned and raised her elbows on the other’s arm, and bowed her head to avoid the weapon stabbing herself – anyone talking Attention can not be completely concentrated, so there will be a breath of gas, this is what the training officer repeatedly teaches her. On the contrary, if you want to get out of the body or attack, it is best to take the other side of the mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organ hidden in the sleeve is also triggered at the first time, a white powder is sprayed toward the back - this alchemical powder can release a lot of heat when it meets water, if it enters the eye Or the mouth can let the other party lose the fighting power instantly. Even if it is lucky not to suck the powder, it is enough for her to be in a hurry for a while.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Afra’s four sides The witch swooped over, a blonde woman flew up in an instant, and the oldest looking witch was in front of the other two. She pulled out a pointed dagger and stabbed directly at the head. Anyway, the three people who can't escape will die in her hands. In a moment when the short sword penetrated into the other's body, Afra saw an incredible sight.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white shadow appeared on the side of her side, and the eyes under the hood flashed with anger, and there was nothing in the air before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the nightingale behind... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind of close-range powder eruption, why didn't it affect her at all? The faceless person could hardly believe his own eyes. I saw her raising her hands to herself. The silver-colored weapon shot a flame, and the body was pushed hard by the force. It suddenly lost its balance and leaned back. Fall to the ground. No, there are... Two people have to solve, Afra wants to stand up, pull out the short sword and stab the next witch, but finds that it is very difficult to raise the hand, and the consciousness is quickly blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
