			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guardian madman made an angry roar, they grabbed the bone spear and the arm quickly expanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was the previous lightning, the first thing that comes to mind must be to drop all the weights and speed up and escape as soon as possible. But at the moment, her mind is unexpectedly clear, and there is one spider magic. Without a weapon, it can't stop the other party. In any case, it can't be discarded! Then the only way is to rely on the difference in vision to avoid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She deliberately flew out to a straight climb route, and when she passed the canopy and disappeared into the eyes of the enemy, she suddenly turned direction and changed from rising to flat. Flying - almost at the same time, two bone spears arrived as expected, piercing the branches and then hitting her feet against the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightning is long and the gas is exported, and the head does not return to the next place prompted by McMug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when she saw the second spider, her heart was half cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spar column on the other side of the opponent has grown completely and lifted up high. The blood vessels on it are shining blue, obviously on the edge of the launch! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she has not loaded a new grenade into the launcher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mc茜! Interfere with it, don't let it cast a stone pillar!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗷———————!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goshawk that has been hovering over the head swooped down, and the figure quickly expanded, and it turned into a blink of an eye. An amazing beast of the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madman who is next to the spider devil is also a bit worried, and does not seem to understand what this is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜's huge body smashed on the side of the target, its momentum is no less than a cannonball! The sand and mud smashed between the clouds, and the spider magic on the ground was hit by a cockroach. The body fell to one side and almost turned to the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the stone pillar was projected almost on the ground - the poorly-dead madman became the first victim, the nearly swept pillar For example, the rolling stone generally rolls over the seat where they are located, and then crashes into the woods without seeing the deceleration, rolling for dozens of meters before stopping. Not only did it break into several pieces, but it also swept out an empty fan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Make it beautiful!" After the lightning hit the ground, he loaded the warhead, released the insurance, and pointed the single grenade to the spider magic - the latter is still dancing Short-legged, like struggling to get up, and she certainly won't give this opportunity to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grenade accurately hits its unobstructed abdomen, and the flames and blasts from the explosion spurt directly from the other side, exploding its belly A large hole that is transparent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After determining the target’s silence, Lightning pulled up the stubble that had returned to normal. “Are you alright?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem! I hit the thickest piece of meat on the shoulder!" She rolled up her sleeves and pretended to have a lap in her arm, and suddenly she reached the highest point and suddenly froze. A face is sore and wrinkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't seem to be thick enough..." Lightning touched her head and said softly, "I will bake more game for you to eat later. Whoever makes you hit is not afraid... but now I have to stick to it again, okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm!" McMug nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So come on," Lightning squatted and put the little girl who turned into a dove on his head. "Let's go support everyone - no winter adventure group , Depart!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呯!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia pulled the trigger and knocked a demon coming out of the ground to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time I fired? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a few dozens of hair? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it’s a ten-one, it’s a devil, but the enemy’s offensive has not weakened, but it’s fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The madman she had never put in her eyes, but now it has become an extremely difficult opponent - due to the quantitative advantage, the enemy can Unconcerned stretching fronts, from the flank, if not the gap in the weapons, they can not contain the other side's pinch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the inter-forest battle also greatly offset the effectiveness of the guns, while the madman uses trees to avoid the bullets, while cold and not shooting a wave of spears, all sides attack The direction can be said to be invincible, and the body is full of firearms, the god of punishment, such as shields and other defense equipment can only rely on body and skill to avoid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More terrible is that in addition to the aggressive demon, the enemy also has a high-level demon. It is probably transformed from the Lord of Hell, still retaining the appearance of the monster of the four-legged demon body. Although the ability is far less than that of Erskuk, the physical quality is exceptionally strong, and the big tree is often thrown as a spear to throw. Every time you need it, you need it. Several gods and witches joined forces to block. At the same time, it can also summon the earth wall to provide cover for similar attacks. After the turn of consumption, the defense of the people has been quite a bit lost, and the speed of the withdrawal is getting slower and slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time loading, aiming, shooting, it seems to have become a mechanical movement, the pain of the wound and the fatigue of the body repeatedly impact her brain, Ann Delia gradually felt a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andreia, beware of the right!" After two waves of spears, Sylvie, who was guarded in the middle of the team, suddenly shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savage savage of a team has attracted most of the firepower of the sorcerer, and the sorcerer’s giant sword, such as the ghost, has fallen into love. Lina and her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia lifted his gun but was cut into two pieces by Erskuk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fatal second strike. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is between the electric and the flint, the scene seems to be fixed here. She can see the blue light from the palm of her hand, and the magic of the cohesiveness makes the five fingers become an invincible blade. As long as she swings, she can put her to death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tightened her body slightly, waiting for the heartbreaking pain to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the expected death did not occur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last minute, Elena turned sharply and took the shot for her -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's paws have drawn a terrible wound on her chest, and the ribs and organs are exposed. Even the body of the gods, it is impossible to force this wound to fight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No-!" Zoe turned his guns angrily and fired several shots at Ersk. Such a close-range shotgun can not completely avoid even the demon, the barrier on it is finally broken, half of the body is covered with bullet holes, blood straight out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the enemies flying back dozens of meters did not show the painful color, but smirked and inserted their broken body into their body. - Under the magical power of madness, its body healed at a speed visible to the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Monsters..." Hillview, who witnessed all of this, could not help but make a desperate exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Plundering life, giving yourself is the ability I gained from promotion, and calling me a monster is too rude." Erskuk returned to another Only the high-level devils, replaced with the gas tanks handed over by the other party, said in a sly manner, "Every wound in your body, every passing power will become a part of nourish me! Fighting now, you should have been able to anticipate At the end of the struggle, the struggle will only increase the pain. If you surrender now, I can let you die without pain, as a reward for your heroic battle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let your mother's fart!" Zoe yelled. "I will never give in to the devil. If I die a thousand times, I will tear you into pieces!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
