			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough...just a scam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod stood in the air and looked at the sea in the north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days it has searched hundreds of miles along the twilight coastline, not only at the end of the continental spine, but even on both sides of the ridge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the description of the letter is unknown, in order to miss the legendary bottomless, its search scope covers almost all possible areas, until the connection to Blackrock The road to the sea of ​​clouds in the domain stopped. But even so, it failed to find the "isolate island" in the letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about it, there is no obstruction in the sea. When you are in the blue sky, you can see the scene within a thousand miles at a glance. I really want to have such a strange island. When the ethnic group marches from the Blackrock Field to the Shuguangjing, we should be able to see it. How can we wait for it to discover? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod couldn’t help but clench his fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The damn human being, dare to deceive the Lord of the sky! What is even more unforgivable is that they used the name of Wakiris! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightmare cannot betray the ethnic group. Human beings can do this. It is only possible to extract its memory. Although it is not clear when the group of witches had such ability, Wakiris’s end can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An extremely angry anger rushed to its chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It suddenly opens the door of twisting, stepping on the sea one step at a time-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom of the world, what the consciousness world is here, are shit!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hecksod is squatting while walking through the sea, like I have vented my dissatisfaction that has accumulated my heart for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can the field of the gods be in this kind of plain place, I should have thought of it!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Directly enable God of God, kill human beings and do it all right... It’s a risk to sneak into the depths of consciousness! Now, the great monarch has become a bait for everyone. It’s stupid to be questioned by the king!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This hatred, I must ———”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of Heaven suddenly kept the roaring appearance in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparkling sea surface just before, but now it has become unclear, I don’t know when to raise the white mist, the visibility suddenly drops. Within a few feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It broke into the fog? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No... Even if it’s a fog, you shouldn’t be unaware of it before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod returned one step in the same way, and the sea became clear again. It turned his head and saw the sea in a few miles away. You can see the end of the sea antenna at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indignation in my heart suddenly disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; replaced by an unstoppable chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are not too far from the 曙光境 and Blackrock fields. In the past few hundred years, no one has ever noticed the vision of this place? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hesitated for a little while, it mobilized again and entered the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, its actions are a lot more cautious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing through the door, the damp dense fog quickly enveloped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod lowered the height, moving slowly against the waves, and mentioned vigilance to the highest. It didn't take long for a black shadow to appear in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flying to the edge of the island, it landed down and stepped on the ground covered with grass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here... is the place mentioned by Wakiris? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod looked around and couldn’t see anything except the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measuring his own status, it decided to go hiking on the island first - it had just replaced a new breathing tank soon, and the reserves were quite adequate On the road of the sea of ​​clouds, the supply lines of the ethnic groups flow, and there are two standing sentinels at the junction of the light and the black stone fields. In terms of its ability, the possibility of an accident is not great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hundreds of steps, the scenery has gradually changed. There are more stone monuments in the grass, and there is a growing trend. These obvious things carved out by the creatures mean that the island is not a restricted area where no one is involved. Hecksod checked a few monuments and found that the text above was not familiar to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello." Suddenly someone said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the Lord of Heaven only feels cold and upright! It unfolded the door of twisting without thinking, and spread it into the air, and prepared for counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the speaker did not launch an attack from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was actually a family member. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view, at least the high-level promotion, its shape completely erases the roughness of the original body and the ascending body, and the degree of evolution is extremely high. Fingers and hair are clearly distinguishable. It is wearing a light white gauze, with bare feet and two hands on its backs. The tone of expression is very easy-going, and there is no such thing as a strong spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am the Lord of the Supreme God, who are you? When did you come to the island?" Heckzod kept a distance and asked, " Is there a supply of life here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am just a watchman." It whispered. "As for the time to stay here, already I can't remember it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Watcher?" Heckzod recalled a little, and did not find a high-order with this title in his memory. Promoter. As for the long time to remember, it is even more nonsense. Before the first battle of God, the ethnic group has not yet reached the northern end of the glory. How can it alone live alone on this island? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, so I am not your family. It is not me who decides this deputy, but yourself." The watchman echoed softly, " I know this is hard to understand, but it is the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is not a tribe, in other words it may be an enemy. What's more, Hecksod also noticed that the other party did not wear a helmet and there was no trace of access to the breathing can, which is tantamount to its rhetoric. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the vigilance of the Lord of Heaven has increased by a few points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the bottomless place? Where is the consciousness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watcher shakes his head "This is just a bridge and requires a key to open."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of key?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It pauses for a moment, as if thinking, "...in your words, the complete "inheritance." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the inheritance fragments are reunited, the road to the source of magic will be revealed - is this not the same as the revelation that the ethnic group has handed down! Kzodton felt a sigh of relief. It has already been seen. This guy can't talk well. He has to make up some weird titles to express his differences. This is exactly the same as the fake face.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s a bridge or a road, it’s the same thing! Heckzod feels that his brain has never been running at such a high speed. “Can take me to see ... that bridge? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watchman hesitated, and it looked to the north. "It can be, but it must be faster, there is not much time left..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
