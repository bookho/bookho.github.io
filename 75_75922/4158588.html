			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the living room of the Grey Fort, Roland quietly looked at the old man in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in a wheelchair, his hair was gray, his cheeks were sunken, and the wrinkles on his forehead were high and heared, and he was almost at the end of the years. However, compared to his age, his eyes are not too turbid, and he still looks angry. The monocles on the tip of the nose and the black bow tie between the necks further strengthen this feeling. While Roland was looking at him, he was also looking at Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Roland broke the silence and showed a smile. "It’s not an easy task to bring you from here in the morning. Welcome to the ash. Fort New King, Mr. Barry L. Rosa, has worked hard all the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is my pleasure to be able to get the summons of the King of Grey Fort... "The other party bowed his head slightly. "I just don't know what to ask for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have contributed a lot to the Grey Fort and don't need to finish anything." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" He clearly showed an unexpected look. "Your Majesty, have you made a mistake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, people of this age will have a sharp decline in their thinking speed, and they will be unclear and intermittent, but Barrych not only answered the words in the first time, but also controlled facial muscles to make a disguise. This is enough to prove that his brain has never stopped thinking about it. His consciousness may more accurately reflect his own condition than the aging that the body cannot reverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know you have concerns, but please be assured that I have no malice on the money." Roland spread his hands and said, "Tell the news to you." God made ', and it was also a part of no winter. In fact, it was me who asked them to send a message."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mouth of Pasha, the conversion ceremony has been used The reason for the timing was to bring Barry to the Grey Fort. After the target was determined, the person was forced to bring it back to the castle. Although the method was slightly rough, the victory was straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello...I don't quite understand what you mean..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, I I will say that you understand it - this is a very tortuous story, but it has happened." Roland summed up the past of the ancient witch, and also said the essence of the transformation ceremony of the gods. The soul container can only collect the consciousness of the demon person. In other words, the unmagic can only become the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becoming a body without self is in some sense also consistent with the rhetoric of the ancient witch Yanshou, if the black money is only an ordinary underground chamber, he Not too much care. However, in the battle against the Devil's West Line Army, the black money made a great contribution, not only assisted the First Army to prop up the wolf heart and the winter war zone intelligence network, but also sent key information several times to fill the witch. The detection gap in the red fog area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Barryh did this not for the fate of mankind or for saving his compatriots, but this contribution is real. Roland doesn't think that it is a suitable reward to turn such a person who has merited power into a lost mind, so he decided to personally meet each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Barry Lorza slowly took off the reading glasses, and the voice trembled a little. "What do you mean, is life long just a scam?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sighed. "At the moment, it can be a demon in the maintenance of consciousness. For humans, it is Witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he developed the world of dreams, he could not be sensed by the soul container. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After I can drink those medicines, my body is really getting better--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those potions can't be said to have no effect. It increases the success rate of rituals through overdraft vitality, but it can't be used endlessly." Roland shook his head and interrupted. "Soon its side effects will appear, and this is me. Why are you rushing to find you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barryh took a moment, "Do you mean, I haven’t had much time..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," Roland regrets. "I can't make this promise a perfect one. I can only compensate in other ways. The money protects the witch and is the god." If you have anything to do, you can make it. This is a reward you deserve."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her thoughts can't be wrong, but Roland knows that since the Grey Fortress accepts the Takira witches in full, they can't just enjoy the benefits they bring. It is also an obligation to accept them on their behalf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Barry has been silent for a long time. "Can you handle it even in the morning?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should know, my influence in the morning kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then I am relieved." Unexpectedly, the other party There is no despair or hysteria, but a calm smile. "I hope to live longer, I want to keep the money for the children. If I die, other noble businessmen will never put it." I have divided the opportunity, and in the face of a large enough interest, several lives are insignificant. If you are willing to intervene, I don’t think anyone dares to act rashly, which is even more reliable than my personal life. If so, what else do I have? Complain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland indulged in a small meeting, "Are you sure this is the reward you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, is it... can't you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not He paused. "I wonder if you have heard of the name Rainbow Stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Somewhat heard," Barry thought, " It seems to be a new clothing line in your country, the scale is very large, and some finished products are still sold in the morning light - but IMHO, in style and design, it is far less than us."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Victor’s craftsmen are all from the Lothar family...and he didn’t tell you that in the winter city, this kind of clothing is only one-tenth the price of other hand-woven clothing. . Roland coughed twice. "As far as I know, the founder of this clothing line is called Victor Loza, who is your fourth son. In addition, the income of the clothing company has been converted to more than 10,000 gold dragons. This talent is here, I feel that even if there is no gray castle to be a backer, he will not easily lose to those merchant families."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10,000 gold dragons are by no means a small number No winter, only chaotic drinks can exceed this number - the reason is very simple, not everyone needs a drink, but everyone has to dress. With the high concentration of the winterless population, the scale of basic needs will only expand further. In the face of foreseeable industrialized production profits, the turnover of the underground chambers of commerce is not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Barrych really showed a surprised look. "Your Majesty, what you said... is it true? He has been since he left the Glow City. I have contacted me less... I thought he was still doing the previous jewellery..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Victor is now without winter, you want to see him and It’s not difficult, it’s better to verify it in person. But... you have to hurry.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes... I know.” Barrych couldn’t help it. Grasping the wheel, this action clearly exposed the thoughts of the heart. "Please let me retire, sire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded and was preparing to call the guard to send him out, he suddenly said, "You said mine Time is running out... Can it let me spend the last moment on that floating island?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Roland closed his eyes. "If you want to do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the door was closed, the nightingale showed its figure and whispered, "Odd..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reaction at the beginning was a bit strange, but it can't be said to be a lie, just The magic gives me a very vague feeling, not as calm as he is." The night sherbling shrug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out," said Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probably." He slowed down his voice and looked down Out of the window, "The longevity of this kind of thing is always full of temptation. If the expectation is lost, no one will accept it easily."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But that is not a lie." The nightingale emphasizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
