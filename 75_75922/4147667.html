			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tillie saw that the first flight group obviously noticed the approach of the opponent, and the first and third machines spread out in two directions, seemingly wanting to The flanks hit the second group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the second group is not as tidy as it was originally, but the goal is still the nearest one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made the latter suddenly fall into a one-on-three disadvantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the magic eye, she can clearly capture the tension on the pilot's face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of almost head-on hedging on both sides, as long as the crosshairs are stuck in a plane, one change is not impossible. The driver's nervousness affected his behavior, only aiming for two or three seconds, he stepped on the left pedal and chose to avoid. At this time, the distance between the two sides is still more than 500 meters, which makes the second group adjust the course direction without burden, from the attack to the chase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get rid of the tail bite as much as possible, the No. 1 machine began to make various maneuvers - as the Tilly said at the opening, the pilot will be his life. The study has come out. Being able to master the technical requirements of each movement in just one month must be hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the students of the First Army were not inferior, and they were not swayed by a series of dive, and they always followed the other side without hesitation. Coupled with the quantitative advantage, they do not need to keep their heads fixed on each other at all times, while the latter needs to pay attention to the movements of the three aircraft at the same time. A lot of maneuvering caused the height and speed of the No. 1 machine to drop a lot. Seeing that he couldn't get rid of it, the pilot bit his teeth and turned around and flew toward the No. 3 machine that was still coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group also got the best out of the mobile phone conference at the same time, keeping the sixth unit in the higher airspace into a dive, slanting from the top of the head to the first Press the end of the machine at 7 o'clock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the machine gunner observed this scene, the pilot also made the greatest rescue measures, but the aircraft has been unable to open this round of "sweeping". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten seconds and blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly was nodded with satisfaction, "No. 1 square, holding red flag!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This The third machine arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are facing a climbing machine number six and two other good-quality four and five machines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation seems overwhelmingly unfavorable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- If the second machine that has been at a high point is not counted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her eyes to the college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw them!" Finchem will halfway out of the seat and squat on the fuselage. "Wait, the first machine seems It has been shot down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are sure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The number one on the airport has been It’s red, but they haven’t left the battlefield yet!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s just that they haven’t found it yet,” Goode frowned, and his teammates insisted on their time. Imagine being short, "What about the third machine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I didn't guess wrong, the black spot that came from a distance is!" Da Ladao said, "Man, they are now in a mess, it is time to join the battle!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a second... look at your back, can Did you see the sun?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and was immediately stabbed and closed his eyes. "Oh, it’s the pilot I chose. It’s right now. I almost can't open my eyes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that you guessed the fist and lost. Goode shook his head helplessly and pressed the joystick hard. “If that’s the case, let’s go!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah-----嚯!" Finchem screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the knight who is charging! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to gallop is the whole sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third teammates focused on the slowest second group of aircraft, and the other two began to expel the third aircraft until they were from the golden In the sunshine, if the thunder rushed to the latter, the other party noticed the existence of the new opponent from the sound of the whistling wind. Goode noticed that if the two planes did not pay attention to the teammates, they would be shot down first. As the target of the third machine, I am afraid that it has already succeeded. It was this plan that took care of him and gave him the best shooting window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two machines realized that it was too late. After swiftly passing over the No. 4 machine, Goode did not hesitate to switch the target to the plane marked with the number five. As early as he dive, he firmly locked the former, although it was quite tricky. It does not mean that he can really shoot down the No. 4 plane at that distance. This is the rule that the Princess has set. He believes that His Royal Highness has already seen it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teammates may be forced to withdraw from confrontation training at any time, he must hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four biplanes were entangled with each other and the situation became anxious. Especially on the fifth machine, Gude can even see the look of the other shooter. Although his landline lost its concealment, he still dominated the speed. After several competitions, Goode finally took a long-term aim. Just as he estimated that it was almost the same, Finkin in the back seat had already reported the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The flag of the 5th square has turned red!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost simultaneously, the third The machine also announced the exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still green flags on the airport, leaving only the sixth and themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably the second group of double-machine suppression gave the teammates too much pressure, the third machine failed to get enough aiming time after all, the sixth machine got After the respite, it soon appeared behind the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those guys are doing something, even one is not hit!" Finkin slammed the machine gun seat. "This doesn't turn into three dozens." "Is it all right now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who asked us to use them as bait at first," Goode didn't think, "Of course there is a possibility - That is the other party's No. 6 is a tough opponent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this guess is quickly fulfilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which direction he turned, the sixth machine was tightly bitten, and the chance of opening it was not given. He can't move, otherwise the latter will definitely get up to ten seconds earlier than Finchem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn," the partner’s voice was significantly more anxious than before. "Can't you fly faster?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have tried my best!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This way we will be killed sooner or later, think about it! Go to the port area to avoid How? There are sailboats to cover!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If you hit a refugee ship – whether it is us or not, what do you think will be the end?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it’s probably a shot." Finkin’s momentum suddenly fell. "If that's the case, at least we're not the first to be eliminated. Now unless There is a wind to send us up, otherwise I think we are not moving back to this game."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wind..." Goode glimpsed, in his mind It’s like a flash of light. “You’re right, I think of a solution!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ha?”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you remember the wind on the edge of the cliff?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea breeze from the vortex sea to the land is not static, especially on the side near the coast - due to the rock wall Blocking, the airflow will spread along the obstacles, and some of them will become a fast-rising blast. As long as you stand on the edge of the cliff, you can hear the rhythmic whistling from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After realizing what he meant, Finkin’s face couldn’t help but be stiff. “You’re crazy! Let’s not say if we can get the upper hand, too close. If you rock the wall, you will be finished with your hand!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
