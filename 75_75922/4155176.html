			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you like to go to the Budokan?" Wakiri Silk dressed in a nightgown walked out of the bedroom and saw the Fijian language cold finishing the final line in front of the porch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I will have to hurry until the end of the war." The other party paused. "Are you coming later?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the other side’s all-out look, she briefly nodded and said, “If there is nothing else.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then I set off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened and closed, and the chill that poured in was quickly dissipated, Wakiris Looking down at the open palm of his hand, he slowly became a fist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, what are you doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past month, she has almost completely integrated into the world, not only became a member of the martial arts association, but also repeatedly attacked with others. The devil fights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for the world not to be destroyed, it is necessary to resist the gods. This may be the reason for her participation in the war, but Wakiri’s heart is clear, that is more The way to relieve pressure, the problem she really has to face is not here, but outside the ideology - she is not willing to be trapped here doing nothing, in this way to make herself look like to solve the gods Fighting power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the battle is cruel and arduous, then they are fighting against "God." But the fact is that the elimination of the demon is only happening in the darkness that the public can't see. The whole city is still in a peaceful climate. When there is no task, everyone even has time to have a cup of afternoon tea or gather together for a night snack. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a far cry from the war she used to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes her more uncomfortable is that she has quickly adapted to such a life...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soft The sweeter the peninsula of the peninsula, the stronger the guilt and guilt of her heart. The front of the ethnic group is uncertain. In order to win the battle of God's will, the tribe has almost invested everything, but she enjoys a free and relaxed life. This contrast makes Wakiris painful, and sometimes even wants to pour the anger into her heart. Around the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the more painful thing is that reason still exists and is not distorted by tremendous pressure - reasoning clearly telling her that doing so will not make dreams Broken, it does not help the ethnic group, it will only make your situation worse. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, another point to stop the nightmare from doing this is that she found herself unexpectedly disgusted with Fiji. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this human woman has overheard her conversation with Roland, it’s just a reasonable choice for the other person who wants to control her own destiny, not to mention she will The courage is so dazzling that the things that I have done are coming out of the tray and calmly confronting the fact that I only exist in the ideology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is pure, curious, determined, and clear-minded... These characteristics make Wakiris reminiscent of the "Thousand-shaped" Sistallis . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people’s shining is enough to cross the racial divide, just as the thousand shapes are accepted by the Yunxiao school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why she has never moved out of here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that this light has not only relieved her pressure, but has made her even more confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Wakiris has faintly realized that what is really beneficial to the community, but the emotions can not face it calmly - that step If you take it out, there will be no possibility of turning back. All the pressures and risks will be borne by her alone. Even her, it is difficult to make up her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of fate, she is not as good as this human woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the phone rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vakiris hesitated and repeated, and finally connected the phone. "What's the matter? If it is a unilateral Hubian frontline war report or province, I will not be in the absence of Heikezod's confirmation." —”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I just want to ask, what is going on in the floating land?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The first sentence of the other party made her stay in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rose Cafe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Roland’s complete account, Wakirisi leaned back on the chair with some tiredness and vomited gas, “God of God...” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God made - what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at each other silently, wanting to get from him I saw something in the eyes, but the result told her that this was not a premeditated fraud. Roland had no knowledge of what he had discovered. The exposure of the god of God was only due to a coincidence, such a coincidence Every moment is happening, and it will not have much impact on the situation. As the trump card in the hands of the ethnic group, the high-level is more likely to hope that human beings will see the miracle created by this magic. After all, even if they witnessed its existence in advance, it will only increase the fear and despair of the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Wakiris thought more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The God of God should have been the ultimate weapon against the heavens and the sea, but now suddenly appears on the Western Line, which can only explain one thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battlefield on the Western Front has reached a point where it is difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is not the case, the king will never agree to use the god of God to deal with humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a logical dead chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the Western Front suffered a great defeat, the top will use the god of God to restore the situation, and it is for this reason that the witch has a chance to bump into the god of God. - This means that the text messages sent by Roland before are true, and they prove their sincerity in disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless Roland explored the existence of the god of God from other Maharajas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this possibility is minimal, and if there are other Maharajas who are willing to cooperate, there is no need for him to come back to play this show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inner pain caused Wakiris to clench his fists. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that she can't deceive herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her feet seem to be on the edge of the cliff, there is only a single wooden bridge in front, and the emotion of the encounter almost engulfs her. Just as the overwhelming pressure was about to overwhelm her, the scene of Fiji’s chilling disappointment suddenly came to mind—<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She clearly heard the rebuttal of the other party without retreating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fearing a terrible future and giving up is just a matter of swearing, even if we end up failing, it is all done!" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention...going forward...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wakiri gaze at Roland for a long time, then closes The eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you see is the god of God." She repeated, "That is the trump card prepared by the ethnic group for the heavens and the sea. It is also true. The absorption of the inheritance of underground civilization has reappeared. As early as hundreds of years ago, my family had the idea of ​​getting rid of life--that is, your so-called red fog restriction. The most direct solution is to let the birth of red fog. The tower moves freely, but it is also the most difficult to achieve. It is enough to move the huge tower, not to mention the stone veins below the bottom of the tower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Until the mask is fully mastered by the magical techniques of underground civilization, and on this basis, the program has ushered in a glimmer of light. I don't know how this specific change will be achieved, but Its essence is to transform the tower of birth into a huge magic core, and to improve the core ability. As long as the magic is abundant, the wide-ranging phenomenon caused by it is not too much compared with the miracle. Therefore, Wang Cai Give it the name - the god of God."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
