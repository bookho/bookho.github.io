			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After wearing a protective sock for her, she took her to the wheelchair, followed by a simple wash, breakfast... Amy in the next bedroom also woke up Come over, when everything is ready, the two push the wheelchair and walk to the hospital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the hero is much more nervous than usual, and there is almost no opening on the way. Fortunately, Amy has played the role of an active atmosphere, so that the tension will not spread to the broken sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Amy himself... Probably optimistic is her nature, she can smile at any time, even on the road to the dawn of the Dawn Kingdom - this is very Let the broken sword envy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at the hospital, it was almost 9 am, just entering the yard, and the three saw the Wendy adults waiting at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not only Wendy, but also books, Anna, leaves, mystery, Lily... Almost all members of the Witch Alliance gather here, waiting for them 's arrival <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not being treated, the broken sword still felt the warmth of the heart suddenly rising, and she even felt that her eyes were a little sour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a slight tremor in the palm of his hand, and she knew it was a heroic ups and downs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your Majesty and Marquis Sper are already waiting for you in the medical room," Wendy smiled and stepped forward and touched the hero's head. Don't worry, you will be able to regain your freedom soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello?" The sword broke and he said, "Is Roland also coming?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Others who can," Mystery said, "Let Lily put down the microscope and the weird bugs, and follow him, and only kneel down." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't talk nonsense!" Lily yelled and grabbed her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made the three people can't help but laugh out loud, and the tension can't help but ease a few points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty shook his head helplessly, "Let's go, don't let your knees wait too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The broken sword pushed the wheelchair into the medical room, and after saluting the king and the Marquis, carefully took the hero to the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the latter was preparing to take the herbs, Annie finally rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gently holds the hand of the hero, as it used to be, "I will stay here until you wake up."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence seems to have incredible magic, the girl who saw the bed in the broken sword finally settled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, on the long road to escape, it was Anne who was busy with the work and brought three girls without experience in the wild to the morning. . In the process, they all regarded Annie as the backbone of the heart. I believe that as long as she is there, any problems will be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero didn't take long to sleep, the hero fell into a deep sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get started," Wendy said to the broken sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded and closed her eyes - in an instant, the five senses disappeared instantly, as if they were thrown into a void. However, this feeling only lasted for a few times, and soon she "visited" the things around her - through Miss Nana's eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience after the ability to perform is very wonderful, she can even see herself, like a short and thin "dagger", flowing between the blades Full of vitality, green power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general dagger of the willow is the opinion put forward by His Majesty. He said that it is too weird to wield a long sword in front of the hospital bed. It is also very inconvenient. Look like it. He also gave this weapon a quirky name called a scalpel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a more embarrassing magic rushed into her body, and her feeling of fullness made her unable to suppress the sound, of course, Only the little girl holding her can hear this slight embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s much better than the previous few times," the broken sword took a deep breath—although it was only her subconscious move. After all, the weapon wouldn’t breathe. “It’s okay, I can afford it, you can use it at will.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This powerful magic comes from the leaves. When Speer Passy connects them together, this magic will also impact the broken sword. Fortunately, Miss Ye's ability has the characteristics of vitality and nourishment. It will not be too uncomfortable after adaptation. Unlike Anna's black fire, it is hard, sharp, and cold, as if it is filled with steel needles, plus the vastness. The magic capacity almost made her intolerable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when working with the witch, only the least cooperation with Miss Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of becoming a blade, she can create a certain conscious connection with the user, and also faintly realize that the witch’s magic is not irrelevant to her own character. The temperament of most witches can always be felt from the fluctuations of magic. Therefore, she is very difficult to understand, and she seems to be approachable, although she is not very intelligent but she is very intelligent, but she will give her the feeling of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna took down the hero’s socks, and the fingertips showed a dark, thin line that tied the other’s legs like a rope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword can't help but shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has seen it with her own eyes. When necessary, this black fire can instantly melt the metal and burn everything, but now, it is like the other party’s magic when she cooperates. The feeling is just like a hard, cold silk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black line disappears quickly, and the broken sword knows that it has shrunk into a slightly undetectable black spot, during the contraction process, skin, blood vessels and bones They were all cleanly divided into two parts - because the cutting surface was too flat, and the entangled parts took a while to gradually show a blood mark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut limb was less than a finger thick, and Nanawa picked up the peeled skin with a short plaque and driven the magic to wrap the wound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next treatment has been seen many times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloody red wound began to grow forward, and the new skin under the old skin grew pink, and the magical power of the two bodies also lapsed rapidly. The supplement, it will not take long for them to consume all of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about half an hour, a pair of complete feet finally appeared in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa’s spirit is also at its limit. She almost dropped the scalpel and released the broken sword. She held the bed and gasped, and the forehead was covered with small Sweat beads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the broken sword is not much better, the whole process seems to her to be inflated in the internal organs, even after the original appearance, the body still Sore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl was taken by Wendy to take a break in the next room, but she insisted on staying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants to see the hero wake up with Anne and Amy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the efficacy of the sleeping fern faded, the hero slowly opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How?" Wendy lifted her up and sat on the bed and asked softly, "Can you feel its existence?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She first shook her head, as if she wanted to take the rest of her sleepiness out of her brain, then widened her eyes and stared at her feet. It was originally bare and half, except for the distressed scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone held their breath and cast their gaze on her back. The medical room was silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the slender toes shivered slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart of the broken sword also followed, and she even thought it was her own illusion, blinking her eyes and looking again -<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toes have shook twice again, and then like a rusty scissors that hasn't been moved for a long time, simmering and slowly bending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
