			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I only mention the framework and basic requirements here, how to implement it, and you will negotiate and deploy it by yourself. The general manager is - Barov Mons. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Following." The manager quickly stroked his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded with satisfaction. After years of experience, Barov has developed how unreasonable it sounds, but as long as he makes up his mind, he will have a bite. Habits should be carried out and tried to implement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of the Inter-Administration’s interrelated structure is also sufficient to support the resources needed to “concentrate power to do big things”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So listen." Roland said that the nightingale will paste the pre-prepared white cloth onto the blackboard. "First of all, it is aimed at the peer-to-peer migration inside the Grey Fort Kingdom... ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢..." Seeing the contents of the cloth, everyone could not help but brighten their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw that White cloth explained several characteristics of the policy in the form of illustrations, which are concise and clear, and can be said to be clear at a glance - this is the original The manual version of the PPT demo, and the technical support is Soroya. As a drawing dog that has been in the design institute, it is only a basic skill to do PPT. This way of explanation is obviously more attractive than empty talk that is easy to lose key information and boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population distribution of the Grey Fort has obvious characteristics of the times. After the great aristocracy becomes the lord, it will gradually build a city, and the surrounding land will be sealed to the lower aristocrats. Then and so on. As the population grows and wealth accumulates, the consumption of big cities will become higher and higher, so that they will be unable to maintain supply, thus transferring this burden to surrounding villages and towns, eventually forming a situation in which most people support a small number of people. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation not only limits the size of the city, but also makes the class flow basically solidify. Those big cities seem to have a large population and a lot of excitement, but they are compared to separate small towns. In fact, the total population of surrounding towns and villages is much larger than the cities it supports. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Roland also knows that this backwardness is not right or wrong, purely due to low productivity. In the case that the production level does not meet the requirements of change, most of the labor force is firmly bound to the land, and only a few of its own output can be enjoyed in the whole life. The rest of the harvest is turned over to the nobility to maintain their freshness. The decent life of Yimao Ma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When recruiting refugees in previous years, the Executive Office also noticed the local population changes and made a rough estimate. The final conclusion is that the gray castle The population should be between two million and four million - during the battle between the two princes and the three kings, and the plague put into the church, which caused almost 50,000 to 600,000 damage, and also made the eagle city in the south and Jinsuicheng in the east is turned into a ruin. Even so, there are still a large number of people scattered throughout the gray fort, and only a small amount of money flows into the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he does not intend to let this situation continue any more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden No.2 wheat is distributed and planted in a month to see the results, or it can now predict the arrival of a bumper harvest. High-yield cotton is also fully rolled out in Bishui Port, and it will take a long time to deliver enough fabric to the kingdom. Large cities no longer need ten times their own population to supply supplies, and now one person’s output is enough to match the hard work of the past ten or even twenty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Grey Fort also completed the nominal unification, the local powers returned to the central government, the land was no longer the lord of the country, but the subordinate administrative agency . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the hardware and software for forced migration are already in place, and it is the best time to implement it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called peer-to-peer migration is simply to give immigrants equal conditions to reduce the dissatisfaction caused by forced relocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the displaced person has a residence in the village, two acres of land, then after the arrival of the winter city, the Executive Office will also be in the newly opened territory. Divide the same resources for him. This will not only speed up the development of the northwestern plains, but also effectively alleviate the shortage of manpower in winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, no matter how good it is, Roland knows that "mandatory" is its true face - whether you like it or not, you must leave the familiar homeland. The process of stunned and uneasy to unfamiliar cities is not so gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
