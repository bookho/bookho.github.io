			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fjord, sleep island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect that the first guest of "Sleeping Curse" turned out to be you," Tilly smiled and handed a cup of hot fish soup, "Exploring Thanks to your help in the remains of the Shadow Islands. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are welcome," Thunder took over the fish soup. "For that mysterious sea, I would like to go several times even if I don't pay commissions." To be honest, if there are no witches, the east of the Shadow Islands is definitely a dangerous restricted area for explorers. He sipped his mouthful of fish soup and couldn't help but export his heat. "Ah... the soup of black-tailed fish is really delicious." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fjord neither popular black tea nor popular black tea ale, they are used to coming to the bowl of cold fish in the summer, drinking a cup of boiling when turning cold The fish soup. The taste of different kinds of fish is also very different. This is the custom that Tilly gradually understands after coming to the island.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can't you wait to visit the "Sleeping Curse"? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Incorrectly, I can't wait to start the next adventure," Thunder laughed cheerfully. "Last time I saw it in the vestiges." The sight of the scene can stun me - what is on the land, why the stone door will appear on the cliff wall, I can't wait to fly over and see. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Tilly also poured herself a cup of fish soup. "You should know that I intend to go to the town of Bianbu in person, both thinking and The lords of the co-help club talked about it, and also wanted to see the moon of the demon in the West. You... don’t you go over with us? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was silent for a moment, then he snorted. "It’s still not, she should have a good life there, so it’s good... after all, explore this kind of thing, say Unexpectedly, an accident will occur. I lost her mother and didn't want to lose her again. At that time, please also..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will," Tilly nodded. "After all, she is also a member of us," she said here. Slightly smiled, "But business is business, although you have helped us a lot, but the price of hiring witches still has to be on the table. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, business is business, this is the tradition of the fjord." "Thunder will drink the fish soup and laugh out loud.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So, what few people did he hire? "Seeing the Thunder leave the palace, the ashes walked out of the hall, sitting cross-legged around Tilly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "Magic servant" Moryl, "Right door The track and the shadow of the "Doll". "Tilly spread the contract," the fee was finally set on 4,800 Jinlong, and the return was very rich, right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four Thousands..." Ashes opened his mouth. "Where did he come so much?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't forget, Thunder is the most famous explorer in the fjord," said the Five Kings. "Whether it is discovering new routes, or discovering them from all over the world." The treasures that come can bring him a lot of wealth. It is for this reason that he has the ability to recruit a large group of experienced sailors again and again to explore the mysterious and dangerous areas. However, with the witch, the risk he took was greatly reduced. Using money to offset the risk has been a good deal since ancient times. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, is this really good? "The ashes hesitated, "Building a bounty guild can indeed bring a lot of wealth to the sleeping island, but the power of the witches will be exposed, if it is passed to the church..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sleeping Charms" is a new guild formed by Tilly, where the explorers of the fjord islands can hire witches of the right abilities to help them complete their adventures. Of course, in addition to the main projects, there are also many convenience services, such as repairing damaged items, making some beautiful works of art, building houses quickly, raising flowers and killing insects, etc. - as long as they do not use the power of witches to do evil, they will be " The Sleeping Curse is accepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the premise of all this is to publish their abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tili pulls up the ashes. "Did I tell you about it, I don't care about the Golden Dragon, but I hope to pass the bounty guild. It will enable more people to understand the island and get close with us. There is a saying in the Thunder that I agree with, the fear is from the unknown, and the witch is the same. The fear of the fjord and the kingdom residents is nothing more than the church. Contamination and ignorance of oneself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
