			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves don’t know how they came over these days,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returning from the wilderness to the desolate mountains The camp took her nearly half a month. In order to avoid the evil beast, she carefully hides in the thick trunk and confirms that there is no evil beast nearby, and then goes to the next place where she can hide. Despite her eagerness, she had no other choice. Once she was discovered by a mixed species, she could not escape her pursuit by her own power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a dozen sisters fell under the killing of the devil, while the other sisters’ abilities were not good at fighting. They jumped into the crowd with the iron hand devil. At the time of the massacre, they fled, but in the end there were a few living back to the camp, and the leaves were not at all. She didn't even dare to think about this terrible problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way to go all the way to the road is quite expensive, and you can only get out of the game for more than ten days a day, especially the magic that you need to spend the night at night. After the dry food on her body is finished, she transforms some wild fruits into foods that can satisfy hunger and thirst. The emblem of the Communist Youth League has long lost its warmth, and she can only wrap herself tighter with bark. Thinking of the promise of being lost in adulthood, the tears of the leaves could not stop falling. What's worse, on the fourth night, the demon corpse that she ushered in the trunk - a series of blows made her almost forget about it. A tear-like pain suddenly burst from the chest and quickly spread to the whole body. For a moment, she almost lost her consciousness, and her tongue was so full of blood that she gathered to fight against the pain. Under the horror of the demon phagosome, the leaves have thought about giving up, but thinking of the more than twenty sisters who may survive, or waiting for her to return at the camp, or being seriously injured, need her treatment and help, she is The teeth stuck to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the demon phagocytic time is not long. When she breaks free from suffering, her body has been covered with cracks, and the blood that flows out puts the trunk. The inside is wet. In order to avoid the smell of blood attracting evil beasts, she had to endure the pain, take off her clothes and go to another big tree. At the same time, the bare branches grow green leaves, and then the green leaves are made into clothes that can keep out the cold. Under the guidance of the magic, the branch became her needle, and the vein was her line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't take a bite of cooked food along the way, didn't drink a hot water. After entering the desolate mountains, although the two layers of green leaf clothes were added, the hands and feet were wrapped tightly, but the rapidly decreasing temperature and the snow without the ankles still frosted her toes. In this way, she stopped and stopped, dragging her unconscious feet, and she finally returned to the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the familiar figures of the sisters, the leaves fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two days of waking up, the long-term temperature loss caused the foot to be severely damaged, and the herbs could not stop the ever-expanding gangrene. The sisters removed two damaged toes from her left and right feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves are not too concerned. It is very good to survive. She is lucky enough to be a sister who will never come back. However, seeing the white cloth wrapped around his arms, the grief of the people could not help but rise from the bottom of my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty-two sisters at the time of departure, there are only six left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone comforted the leaves, the oldest book told her about the experience of the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was fighting with the devil, the non-combatant witch took the opportunity to escape from the camp. On the night they met the evil beast - a group of wild boar species. Everyone could not resist, but they had to flee. The group that was hunted by the evil beast was obviously fierce, but they could not care so much. By the next morning, everyone was stared at by a wolf-shaped hybrid, and only eight people escaped this time. Fortunately, after entering the desolate mountains, the evil beast did not follow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days after returning to the camp, the two sisters showed symptoms of magical reversal. Perhaps it was because the co-help club was hit too hard this time, and the prospects were gray, and neither of them could survive the demon phagosome. The fighting witches did not return, and when everyone thought they were dead under the devil, they did not expect the leaves to come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So... other people? Red peppers, chasing the wind, and the mentor, how are they?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves shook their heads. "Only I am alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
