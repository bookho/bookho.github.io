			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than enough...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such exaggeration, it should have made people laugh, or It was only painstaking to persuade, but before the other person’s confident look, Joe was speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However more incredible is still behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was asked to fully cooperate with the action, so it is necessary to know everything and say nothing - this is not out of Joe’s expectation, since the king of the gray castle Promise to rescue Farina, then it is necessary to understand the situation of Dagong Island in detail, and they have been lurking on the island for half a year, naturally the most familiar group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the other party may also interrogate something else. Joe also intends to make a list. What is the secret of the church and the holy shrine, not as good as Farina’s life. It is important to come. As long as he knows, he is willing to explain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But after entering the cabin, Joe found himself against Roland Wimbledon - this battle with the church for many years, the last hand destroyed the Hermes The idea of ​​the old rivals of the city is completely ignorant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not an intelligence trial or an operational conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting at the end of the long table is the master of drama from the Grey Fort, Kajin Fez. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He asked what you answered," Sean said, leaving the cabin, leaving only a face of Joe, 愣Looking at each other slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was still in the New Holy City, he watched the tour of the Kajin Theatre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been nearly a decade, the impression of memory tells him that the old man in front of him is Kachin himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the thought in the head of the Grey Fortress? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the army that travels with the ship, but the famous theater group... Is this team really saving people? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sit, child." Kajin nodded to him. "Come a cup of tea or a drink?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tea...just fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A well-dressed woman quickly brought a cup of hot tea to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is my disciple, Miss Roentgen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...thank you." Joe had some sorrowful courtesy. If he didn't wear shackles on his wrists and ankles, he almost thought it was a dream. "Why are you here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the agreement between one and the other." Kajin smiled. "We should have been talking in a more comfortable environment." But they said that they didn't agree to take down your lock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, that's fine..." he muttered. "You want to ask." I...what?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The story about Farina, and your story.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Joe dare to look at each other. "You mean, I...and her business?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, when did you join? How did the church know each other, why did she fall into Lorenzo's hands, I want to know." Kajin slowly returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farina [Farina] She..." When it comes to this name, the tingling sensation rises. He had been trying hard to stop thinking about her, but the memories were like tides. Once they started, it was difficult to accept them. As soon as they opened their mouths, the words choked in the throat and their eyes were blurred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina is just a very ordinary civilian woman when she first joined the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large and poor robes, dirty and fast to see the patch of color, hands and feet swollen because of the cold, frozen like radish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is a nobleman in his family. He has nothing but his surname. He wants to try his luck when he goes to church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City does not care about the origins of the birth, nor will it reject any converts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of literacy, he was assigned to a priesthood and became a writer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina became a trainee warrior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Joe very unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest and the warrior are the two major institutions in the Holy City, that is to say, a civilian woman becomes a person who is equal to his status, not to mention the other Still he saved it. In his eyes, Farina should be the kind of chores like the cook and the laundry lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes him even more annoyed is that after a period of rest, he has grown pretty well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why being selected as a warrior is very doubtful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should have been enjoyed by him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the convenience of his position, he did not give Falina a scorpion, and even humiliated her in person. Farina has also been relentless, which has fueled his arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the next few years, this young woman showed her talent a little bit, like a gemstone that was gradually carved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farina was quickly promoted from the apprentice warrior to prepare for the trial army, followed by the selection of the trial army and the trial of the army commander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time of the evil month, Joe can always see her on the wall of the fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was promoted from a writer to a priest assistant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is already above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very close to paying attention to Farina’s every move, for fear of her revenge. But the latter has never taken action, but his concern has evolved into a habit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe slowly discovered that she was not as ordinary as she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Prince Four Princes came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope died, the squadron was destroyed, the cathedral collapsed, and the vast Hermes Church seemed to fall apart overnight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The countless believers fled the holy city overnight, and Farina was on the verge of death, supporting a crumbling trial army on one shoulder. He also pulled him out of the crowd in the middle of the chaos... If it weren't for that hand, he might have been trampled by the fugitives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, he seemed to understand something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the defeat of the Cold Wind Ridge, Farina was not the highest-ranking person in the church. There are still main sacrifices, presiding judges and high-ranking army chiefs in the Holy City. The reason why the responsibility of defending the Holy City is given to her is not so much a matter of value, but rather a shirking and abandonment. The same is true of Tucker’s election as the acting pope. Everyone knows that the Holy City is impossible to hold, but no one wants to blame this blame on himself. At the same time, they need someone to temporarily stabilize the situation in the Holy City, so that they can fight for their escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a 20-year-old woman who became the highest commander of the trial army appeared in Hermes. Ironically, she did her best to let The order of the old and new holy city is gradually recovering, but there are fewer and fewer high-level left-behind people. It is not uncommon for people to go to the building at night. Until the end of the evil month, there were only over 500 trial warriors left in the Holy City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was thrown by those people to Roland Wimbledon as a victim of procrastination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina knows nothing about this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she knew the meaning of this duty from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she still stood up without hesitation and spared no effort to do her best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
