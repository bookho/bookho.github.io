			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this amazing scene is far more than a winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little earlier, Margaret was standing on the Snowwind ship, looking at the end of the blue sea - this is the fleet crossing the sea On the sixty-sixth day of the line, the waves will always flow in the direction of their arrival. The waves are high and low, and the frequency of change is basically the same as that of the shadowy seas thousands of miles away. It seems that these sea waters come from one place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the vortex is really a source, it must be the greatest discovery ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business woman is full of confidence, in addition to the direction of the waves, the other point is the snow wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not rely on the sail-driven body to allow it to travel through the storm without worrying about being overturned. The huge load can also add fresh water and food to other vessels. The first time I came to such a place far away from the land, but no one sea boat left behind, relying on this steel ship that was heavily built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has reason to believe that the Thunder will not return empty-handed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you find?" A familiar voice came from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margaret smiled and turned around. "If there is something, the first thing to inform you must be the lookout on the mast, so you should ask They are right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is the leader of the fleet, Thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not necessarily," he said succinctly. "They may have already discovered it, but they have become dumb or blind because they are too shocked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噗嗤..." Margaret covers his mouth and resists the laughter that destroys the image. What the other party said is what happens when crossing the sea line - when the sea level is in front of the fleet, such as the vertical rise of the wall panel, even the experienced and rich sailors are stunned by this incredible scene. When it was officially overturned, some people were soft and fell down on the building due to the sudden upside down environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually these veterans can stick to the cables and masts like a gecko even in a storm, but this time they fall and fall in a calm situation. It is obvious that the sea line has brought them shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder shrugged, "As far as I know, after a few chambers of commerce, the most eye-catching gaze is replaced, and the most courageous. After all, this It’s too shameful to say it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still something like this..." Margaret shook her head helplessly. "But I saw such a strange sight. After that, I think that no matter what they found, they will not be as ruined as before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows." Thunder patted her shoulder. The voice suddenly calmed down a few minutes. "Do not worry, Joan will be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margaret also put away a smile and nodded hard, "Well. The sea is her world, I think she will meet with us somewhere."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sailing on the boundless sea, optimistic attitude is something The important thing is that compared with the meaningless worry, it is a mature response to keep the spirit of the spirit to continue to the goal. Margaret naturally knows this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I am coming to you because the sailing meeting is about to begin." After a moment of silence, the Thunder gestured, "Other captains." We have all arrived, let’s go back to the cabin.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, I know.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Voyage Conference is where every captain in the fleet gathers on the flagship to report and communicate on the following route development, vessel status and resources. It is usually held every three or four days, which is also to ensure the overall health of the fleet. The key means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two just turned around and took a few steps, and they saw a strange red color suddenly reflected in the blue sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sailors on the deck are also fully stunned, and their eyes are looking in the same direction, as if they have seen something incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to say... Has this group of people been replaced with the most daring? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businesswoman slowly turned her head back and suddenly felt the blood in her body solidified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a huge celestial body in the cloudless sky. It has a round outline and a bright red body, which is dozens of times larger than the sun. Before the count, there is nothing in it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three gods...Bless," she muttered. "Is this what you said...Red Moon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Margaret did not receive any response, this scene is so strange and terrifying, Rao is also unable to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“呜————————呜————————”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At this moment, the snow wind rang the whistle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp humming sound broke the silence of the scene, and everyone slammed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistle is long, meaning that there are enemies approaching! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other and ran to the bridge in unison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened in the end!" rushed into the command room, and the Thunder shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are... there are...ships," the first officer stuttered. "The southeast direction... is coming to us..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say?" Thunder grabbed the lookout in his hand and pointed to the position that the first officer said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margaret’s heart is also sinking, they are now thousands of miles away from the shadows, not to mention people, even birds are rare How could I encounter a Shanghai ship? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that this is a new sea that humans have never been involved in! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked another adjutant to go through the lookout and follow the thunder's gaze—<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "My goodness..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The businesswoman took a sigh of relief and saw that there were indeed two shadows floating in the distance on the sea. There is also no sail, but it is taking waves. But this is not the most astounding. The water around the shadows seems to be boiling, like the countless fish that are advancing along with them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she soon discovered that the surging things were not fish, but the things that sea merchants and explorers didn’t want to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea Ghost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fins behind them are hidden, and occasionally they jump out of the water, and the waves that undulate reflect the strange luster under the red moon. Gregory couldn't help but think of the scene when the sharks competed for food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through me to order, let all the ships turn full steering!" Thunder yelled, "Pull up the sails and advance at full speed! The rest are ready to fight!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are in trouble..." The captain of the tuna swallowed Spit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May the gods bless," the remaining captains prayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any fjord knows that unless it’s a light-loaded fast boat or a windy run, it’s usually a sea boat that runs away from the sea. . This means that if the other party comes to them, it will be sooner or later to catch up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation is clearly getting worse on the worse side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the distance getting closer, Margaret finally sees the true look of the two groups of shadows - they are half like ships, half are made up of flesh and blood, like It is a monster that strips off the epidermis, leaving only the internal organs and skeletons. It is often only in the most terrible nightmare that such creations occur. When the ribs in the upper part of the package were opened, they began to spray a group of dark green objects to the fleet. This distance is more than ten miles away! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
