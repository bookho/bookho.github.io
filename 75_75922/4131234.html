			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three devils reacted immediately, they controlled the fearful beasts to spread out, flew in the direction of the left and right, and soon It disappeared into the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When retreating, one of the devils turned back and threw the spear into the head of the mount that was shattered with half of the wings and spiraled down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Andrea has been staring at the target, the second coin has never appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After actually escaped?" Sawyer was surprised. "What are they doing for this trip?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first attempt to escape to the devil seems to be the first time. In the past impressions, this fiercely incomparable group will not try to bite the target and will not give up. It is neither an offense nor a reconnaissance. It just keeps hovering around in one place, which makes people feel quite surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know..." Andrea released the trigger. "And they seem to have figured out how to avoid sniping. It seems that the enemy is also very good at learning." Hurry, are you saying yes, Little Moryl?" She smiled and looked at Molly, who was rubbing her ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should be reminded early next time," Moryl complained, the movement of this weapon is not much smaller than the artillery, she almost did not have time to protect Live your ears. Even so, the thunderous loud noise still sizzled in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I didn't expect the "guide line" to appear so fast, probably my ability has improved. Andrea blinked. "In order to apologize, how do I give you a special compensation?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not intentional, or not," Morrier scratched his head. "It is more important to defeat the enemy after all." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that would keep me from going." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Looking at the other person’s serious eyes, she had to promise it. "What is the compensation?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chaotic Drinks. "Andreia covers his mouth.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...OK? Molly was surprised. When she was sleeping on the island, she only knew that the other person was not only from the prominent family, but also the ability to be one of the best in the battle witch. The status is comparable to that of the ashes; plus she has always been with Tilly. Therefore, there is not much contact with her. That is, after the arrival of the Winter City, the gap between the fighting witch and the non-combat witch disappeared completely, and she discovered that the other party was not as cold as expected, but a Elegant and intimate.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she didn’t expect Andrea to be so generous!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yeah, the common rule is to have a cup of a card. My special compensation is that if you lose, you can get a cup from me, and I will lose it to you." How, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turns out that if you can't get in, then it's true... Wait, that's not the case!" "Molly wakes up, "Isn't it going to play cards in the end, this lazy act, I-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you have promised, just in Just now. "Andreia showed a "too late" expression. "Don't leave here, I will go to the command post to report the situation and come back soon!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly hasn't had time to explain it. It has jumped to the bricks and the fly disappears at the end of the yard.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks at her face and feels like Maggie, finally knowing the phrase "I am pulling me here"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front line command post. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In half an hour, all the information about this "accidental encounter" has all gathered at the iron axe table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that found the enemy’s trail was the lightning and wheat raft that wandered around the perimeter of the warning ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the description of the lightning, the devil's flight path formed a sharp line on the map - it just connected the railway front and the Takula ruins. In other words, the other party is not performing a patrol alert mission, but instead comes to the first army from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole encounter lasted about a quarter of an hour, and only Miss Andréa won the battle. The anti-terrorist sniper rifle is the only one that can be at this distance. A weapon that hits the target of the flight. After losing one member, the remaining devil immediately chose to retreat and shake around when fleeing to avoid subsequent strikes. It turns out that this is an effective means, and Andrea has not been able to get a mobile phone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi monitors the other side to leave the warning circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning and McMug did not take any further action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fifteen minutes, the alert is lifted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe put down the report in his hand and gave a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the war intelligence integration system developed by Roland - the united by the warring unit to report their actions, and finally gathered in the General Staff Department, and then organized by the staff Refining to restore the entire process of battle. When used in conjunction with maps and sandboxes, the military command layer can have a most intuitive understanding of the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been played several times before the expedition, the first practical use of the system still makes the iron axe feel - he first felt the war is so Clear, it is like standing on the cloud, overlooking the whole process of the battle from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Tiesha City, even if there are hundreds of battles between clan, there may be chaos, and it is necessary to sort out the mistakes and gains, and it will take time and effort to say no. Most of them can only get a rough conclusion. But now, both the enemy's actions and their own reactions are presented in his mind. This kind of feeling makes the iron axe feel that the battles of the Mojin clan can only be considered as fighting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it’s not enough to understand the whole picture. The next most important task is undoubtedly to understand the devil’s intentions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Axe looked at Isis, who was staring at the map - she was the only one who had not discussed with other staff members. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no regret that he has vowed to be a loyal person before he will personally report to the other person in a private contact with Roland. Even if he is sorry for the North Pearl, he will not have a second choice. However, the move was ultimately owed, and he was prepared to be ridiculed or ignored by the other party. But the result is somewhat unexpected. The other party is just like this has not happened. Even if he is blamed, he will still invite him to some meetings of the staff, but he will not discuss the political affairs separately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that he wants to come, he really doesn’t know much about women’s ideas – it’s like this from the very southern days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you find?" The iron axe came behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," Itis shrugged. "I am not a devil. How can I know what they think in a face-to-face."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't discuss with them, I thought I had a clue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is not much discussion about lack of clues Meaning, you can't prove it, you can't falsify it, you can only increase your worries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If so, then I will be the General Staff Department. The conclusion is reported to the sire." The iron axe nodded. If even the North Pearl is unpredictable, then this will stop here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You go." Itiston paused, "but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that things will not end as simple as this. If the enemy really wants to hit our mind, there will be some action in the near future. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following situation confirms the view of Isis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After only two days, the devil appeared again in the northeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
