			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The danger is relative, Mr. Pine, and the danger also means opportunity," the four princes read through the relevant information collected by the assistant minister, "Listen. Say your title is inherited from your father? He used to be a knight and was awarded a baron title and a fiefdom for his combat success."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So," Tigu nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The battle was a battle of honor for the innocent, and the time was also in the month of the demon. A small number of evil beasts passed unexpectedly. The Chishui River crossed the fortress defense line and entered the hinterland of the West. At that time, your father was patrolling the area. When he encountered the residual evil beast, he did not choose to evade as much as most people, and then told the reinforcements to carry out the encirclement. Because he was behind him. Undefended towns - even though the town has nothing to do with him," Roland said while paying attention to the other's look. "You should know more about me later. Your father summoned the town's militia and took it with you. The servant, who fought against the evil beast and won the victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," he was agitated, apparently full of yearning for this family history. "One of them is huge, like a deer and a cow, or a monster that is kneaded together. Its legs are thicker than my father's torso, and the ground is shaking when running. If it is me, I really don't know. How to beat such a strange "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But he did it. My father stood near a shallow ditch and lured the raging behemoth. It accelerated the collision. He lay down in the shallow ditch, and set up a wide-edged sword. The hilt was slanted on a stone at the bottom of the ditch. The seemingly unbeatable idiot ran straight on the tip of the sword, and the whole stomach was cut open. The mouth, the intestines and black blood that flowed out, drowned my father. The trophy of the battle, a huge evil horn, is still on my fireplace."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland drank a cup of tea and said slowly: "The battle worthy of admiration. He followed the knight's beliefs, compassion and heroism. Later, he was given Joey Cole, who gave him the title and the cover. At that time, he was a Piaget of the Long Song Fortress. He was promoted to the Duke by my father Wimbledon III twenty-five years ago, and served as the guardian of the South Xinjiang. The territory under his jurisdiction was spread throughout the entire territory. Unfortunately, after staying alone, he remained in the mountains. Old Penn, east of the fortress, became the thorn in the eyes of the Duke of Fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp; "You know very well under the Highness," Tigu said with some helplessness. "The Duke of Fortress and Joey have never been together. Joey Cole is not the Earl of the Duke of Fortress, his blood. It can be traced back to the royal branch. No matter family or blood, it is no worse than Ryan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is politics, Roland’s heart, played by Wimbledon III. Check and balance tricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to understand this intricate relationship, he called the minister’s assistant to explain to himself for a whole day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The division and jurisdiction between the nobles is extremely confusing. In theory, the superiors have the right to issue orders to the subordinates within the territory, but the actual operation is much more complicated. , Joey Cole and Duke of Lane are examples. As the king of the king directly sealed, although the territory is in the West, there is no less prestige and momentum than the Duke of Ryan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Joey became the Duke of the South, naturally there will be new nails placed into his territory, which is the usual means of maintaining the ruling stability of the Grey House royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So when you inherit this territory, trade and agricultural products are dying, and the family business is not as good as one day," Roland said slowly. Now, there is a new opportunity in front of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"New... Opportunity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "You must have heard of the famine two years ago. The fortress deducted the next month's food on the grounds of insufficient trade ore. This year, we are facing the same dilemma. The accidental collapse of the North Slope mine has allowed Bianbu Town. The people have no way to retreat. We must block the evil beasts behind the newly built walls. This battle may not be smooth, but as I said before, danger also means opportunities."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Tigu has understood the meaning of the prince. He frowned and did not answer immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking, you are not like a nobleman in the usual sense," Roland smiled. "No one will wear it like this, and yours On the hands, they are all hard-skinned. Mr. Pine, you have not let go of your father's heritage? As a knight's good fighting skills."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
