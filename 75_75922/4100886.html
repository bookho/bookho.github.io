			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the situation in the west?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nail and Sang Shugang walked into the central camp, The commander of the Northland garrison, "Eagle", could not wait to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The number of the group is still growing," the veteran took a military salute and told the monitoring trip this week. "It’s scared." One jump, I didn’t expect the Dawn Kingdom to make so many soldiers.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How much?” The eagle didn’t care, and it fell for two. Cup of tea, "eight thousand? or nine thousand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid that more than 10,000 people," Sang Shu will dry the tea, "light is a tent It’s nearly a mile, and there are at least twenty banners with no name, and they don’t know where they came from.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "More than 10,000?" The pen in the hand of the eagle stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't believe, you can ask the monitor," he pointed to the nail next to him. "In order to estimate the approximate number, we risked being discovered. Arrived near the old holy city. The entire city suburbs are the soldiers of the morning aristocrats, they blocked the passage of Hermes and the morning kingdom, most of the refugees have turned their heads to the wolf heart and the direction of the winter to evacuate. There should be a lot more on the side of the ridge. At least on the way back, I saw a few teams of no less than 100 people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The actual situation is indeed like this, Nail nodded and added, "The morning squad should be waiting for the crowd to gather, and the alert to the surrounding area is also enhanced. I suggest that the follow-up investigative team should not be too close to the old holy city, so as not to be discovered by the patrol knight." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the detection of the exception of Hermes, the Northland Garrison began to infiltrate the plateau with the assistance of the Duke of Kant, in addition to hoping to get more In addition to intelligence, it is also accurate for the later battles. . However, His Majesty did not approve the Eagle's temptation attack plan, only to maintain vigilance and continue to investigate. The deputy battalion commander had no choice but to suppress the idea of ​​a big one. While picking out the right candidates from the garrison, he dressed up as a refugee to take turns monitoring the new and old holy city while continuing to send information to the winterless side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, he has not done nothing in these few months, confirming that the Holy City is not using the plan of the suspects, the Northland garrison has regained the cold wind ridge . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the appearance of the morning army, it was two or three weeks ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, are you worried that this group is not good for your actions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha Haha, how is it possible," the eagle laughed. "Even if their numbers doubled again, they were only a target of slowness in front of the First Army. Even the gods could not break through the line of machine gun blockade. What are they based on? Touching the feet of your knees? On the contrary, many people are good. Let them go to the wall of the holy city and try the bottom of the church. It is best to fight both. If you really get to that step, your majesty will definitely agree with my plan. "He paused. "This round of investigations has worked hard for you. Let's go to rest first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, adults," Sang Shujing said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail did not turn away, but hesitated and said, "We can't...repel them in advance?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are all together, "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your disagrees with our own attack on Hermes, but not Will the representative not allow us to block the morning army?” The nail bit the lip. “If they wait for their attack on the holy city, the mountain under Hermes may have become a ruin.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veteran sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you see anything?" The eagle frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The looting and slaughter..." The nails clung to their foreheads and almost did not want to recall the bloody scenes. "They have not yet entered the old holy city, just outside." Stationed, the surrounding residents were caught by them and worn on sharp wooden sticks, and then used such wooden sticks to make the camp wall. As for the women's end, it was even worse -"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
