			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the end of the incomplete spring, summer is approaching, the population growth of No Winter City ushered in the first explosive peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The act of sending people to the southeast to recruit refugees began to pay off. With the experience of the previous year, the team’s recruiting efficiency was greatly Raising, hundreds of people gathered in Chishui City and Liuye Town every day, waiting for the vessels in the West to take them to the rumored and affluent winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to properly resettle these people, the City Hall also commissioned merchants to rent temporary barracks at the gathering place and provide porridge water free of charge to prevent the displaced from appearing before arriving in the West. accident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boundary District Pier has become the busiest area in the city. 90% of the police force is used to maintain order and register the population. The quarantine level is always lined up with long queues. The officials responsible for managing the accounts divide the flooded migrants into several categories, and then move them into riverside board houses, Chengxi caves and formal houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, the busy city hall gives a feeling of flying chickens and dogs every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The three sailboats in Chishui City have just arrived at the dock, a total of one hundred and twenty-six people, the blue flag hanging on the mast, the person in charge is Babu!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Return? Is this the first batch today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fourth batch is still The fifth batch? Don't complain anyway, go pick up the boat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, who is the successor to Bab to Chishui City?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's me! Wait, just fine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember to bring soap, there is no Selling!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the noisy conversation outside the office, Barov is a little frowning, he is not too much, if in peacetime, municipal The more busy the work of the hall, the more pleasant his mood will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But recently, the situation has gotten complicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is in Itis Kant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The general manager, the Ministry of Justice has reminded us!" An assistant walked into the office, "Cartier asked to recruit another 100 as a reserve police officer." He said that if you don't increase the number of people, the law and order in the city will not be taken care of. When you ask about it, we can't escape the responsibility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Hey, don't you rely on yourself as the chief knight, and talk well before you, like this little thing, he has no time to take care of it. While drafting the documents, Barov did not lift his head. "First put it on the table, I will deal with it later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assistant just closed the door, and his voice immediately sounded to the voice of Itis. "Is this the content of the recruitment order? Since you are too busy, I will help you find out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure! Barov snorted in his heart, and even the honorific words were useless! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the other person is the daughter of the Duke of the North, and he is indeed much higher than his identity. Until he becomes the real king, she can use the title. Directly call out his name, but he is also a half-mented teacher of the Missy? After all, His Majesty arranged Itis to the head office to study the structure of the city hall department and the government process, but she does not seem to think so now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well...also." He reluctantly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the heart is helpless, Miss Kant’s words and deeds can’t be said to be wrong. If he refuses and is passed down to his knees, then it’s not reasonable. At this critical time, no one can give a bad impression to the rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will never forget that Roland Wimbledon is a demon who can see the hearts of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
