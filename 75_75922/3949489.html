			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the matter was finished, Roland cleared his throat and said in a serious tone, "The next is the news of the devil and the remains."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told Tilly about the situation that Bianbu Town had discovered in the back of the snowy mountain and in the hidden forest. "I originally planned to send the witch and the first army soldier, and will be in the remains." The trapped person brought back to the town, but the snow that had been ahead of the month for more than a month disrupted the plan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The legendary devil army is close At the close of the scene, there are still people in the remains of more than 400 years ago..." Tilly was astonished and stunned. "I started to believe that you said something to me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Anna looked at Roland and looked at Roland. The latter coughed twice. "According to the scene observed and the reaction of the other side, the devil should have been in the snowy mountains for many years. I guess they are limited by the scope of the red fog. Can't continue to expand to the Kingdom of the Kingdom, so it will not pose a threat to Bianyan Town for the time being. I will establish a relationship along the next two years. Alert points, monitor their movements." He paused. "It is the sealee in the ruins. She is likely to grasp the truth about the ruin of the holy city of Taqila and the church."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too," Tilly closed her eyes and thought about it. "Is there a way to go straight from the air? Ashes say that you have a hot air and you can fly people." Tools."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to bring her out of the ruins on the day of the evil moon?" Roland frowned. "The hot air balloon can be carried by ten people, or To be a little bigger, the number of people will be extended to fifteen people, but no one can bring the First Army soldiers anyway. If you encounter the devil, the witch may suffer casualties, plus the ubiquitous evil beast... this is too "It’s dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really dangerous if you rely on the aid alone," Tilly nodded. "But now there are sawys and ashes, and the degree of danger is already A lot less. According to your previous statement, the main attack method of the devil is the long-range spear. At the same time, the invisible barrier of the Sawyer can block several spears, and the ashes can suppress the enemy in close combat. Now the demon moon has just arrived, the evil beast The power is not strong. If you go to the ruins, now is the best time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland feels a little hesitant, the last time he fought with the devil was to eat an unfavourable loss in air combat. As soon as he thought about flying over again, he felt that his heart was not stable. However, Tilly’s words also make sense. Sylvie’s magical eye can guarantee the discovery of the first enemy. As long as the hot air balloon is kept at a height of 10 to 15 meters, that is, flying against the treetops, it is completely sure to land before the enemy approaches. Next, with the powerful attacking ability of the nightingale and the ashes, the devil squad of about ten people is completely destroyed. Even with the fish missing, Sawyer and Anna's double shields ensure team safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He indulged for a moment, "Are you sure you are going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think, This may be an opportunity to crack the mystery," Tilly admits. "This year's evil month ahead of time, the South China Sea out of evil beasts, always makes me have a bad feeling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;;&nbsp; Roland's heart is a slight glimpse, this feeling he also exists, the evil moon is unlikely to be the abnormal sky caused by climate change, he faintly thinks that these are inseparable from the devil and the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what about the team?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The witch in Bentham Town, I don't know much, but this I will go in person," Tilly said without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a snow fluttering in the gray sky, Mayn and Teflon Slowly boarded the wall of Hermes, which had just experienced a big battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a black and warm blood flowing under the feet, melting the white snow into a thick blood, but these are all flowing from the enemy. Hundreds of gods and penalties are standing straight in the city, waiting for the next wave of attacks initiated by the evil beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishops!" The trial warriors who assisted the gods in the battle of the penalty forces made fists and salutes. Most of the faces looked a little tender, with fear and excitement mixed in their eyes. Two emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are still some children," went to an open space, and Teflon looked at the wasteland and sighed. "When I was so big, I was still at the mill." Grind the flour for the nobles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefron hesitated. "There is no such thing in the holy book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The holy book was also written by the pope, and it is inevitable that omissions are inevitable. "The bishop is on the icy wall, overlooking the cliffs covered with dead bodies. The common evil beasts can't climb such a high wall. They can threaten the holy city. All are mixed aliens," as long as it points out It’s okay in the general direction. From the wild beast that appeared in the previous year, we can infer that we have about ten years left.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unify the four kingdoms and spend eight years accumulating the gods and punishments. By then, the church will have a huge team of more than 10,000 people." He went on to say, "Using the solid walls and topography of Hermes, we Will stay on this plateau until it reverses the enemy's strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am old, I am afraid I can't see that time."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not related to age, Master Teflon," Mayn comforted. "Too many people can't see it." That moment, like Allen, Stone, Li Qi ...... "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;" as well as Heather, "Taifu Lun added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, there is Heather." He nodded. "But in any case, there will be latecomers who will inherit our mission and continue to go."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t say such a frustration," the old man shook his head and smiled. "Right, how is the snow powder formula obtained by Jieluo? Is there a test in the secluded area? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To deal with mortal things, little help to the church," Mayn dismissed. "Snow powder may be used to clean up hordes of evil beasts." But our real enemy is the abyss devil. Its lethality in the open area has dropped drastically, and the power of the devil is so strong that it can be shocked and wounded. The volume must be made very large, except for the gods. People can throw half a big snow powder bag out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes...it's a pity."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to defeat the devil, there is no chance of opportunism," Mayn said in a word, "Only defeat them," . In order to survive "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; At this point, watchtowers side walls came a long horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜"————————"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One long sound, representing evil The beast is coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back to the cathedral, here is the battle again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm," Tefron nodded and just turned and the horn sounded again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜———————呜———————”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two long beeps, which means that there are a large number of mixed evil beasts in the evil beast group, and Mayn’s heart trembles. There is no doubt that the next step of the gods will be a hard battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but...why is it so fast? This is the first month of the evil month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the horn’s reverberation is not over yet, the third horn is ringing again, and the dull and continuous sound is like a thunder, rolling over Hermes Over the sky, it has not subsided for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呜"————————————呜——————————————呜———— ——————————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean can hardly believe his ears, he looks at Teflon, The other party is also looking at himself with a shocked look. The three horns represent the situation is extremely urgent, the new holy city is in danger! Even the last evil beast broke into the periphery of the cathedral, and it did not sound like this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the watchman see? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean quickly saw the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the group of evil beasts that flow like black tides, there are two monsters with huge bodies, they have four thick fangs. Four feet and two hands, wearing dark black fur, just a foot with a wolf-shaped mixed torso thickness, looking far away, the behemoth seems to be a moving fortress, each step in the permafrost covered plain Leave a deep mark on it. If the evil beasts that follow are not avoided in time, they will be stepped into the ground and become a pool of flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
