			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fish balls turned over the rugged mountain top, the vision in front of them became clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orange-yellow wildflowers are all over the ground, in stark contrast to the previously bare mountain trails. When the autumn wind blows over, there will be waves of waves in the sea of ​​flowers. This natural beauty will always make the tired traveler spirit alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the faintly recognizable town of Huahai is the destination of this trip - Fengshuang Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his sixth time crossing the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Yumao is the squad leader of the high-altitude team, he is also a first-class soldier. With the release of the accelerating evacuation order, there are many Soldiers like him are also involved in emergency rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Established to this day, his route has not been attacked by the devil, perhaps because it is too far from the red fog, or the devil simply does not see this escape refugee. But no matter what, each person brings more people back to no winter, no winter can have more strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he has brought nearly a thousand people to the rear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the practice, this team will be stationed outside the town, and then send people to negotiate with the refugees who stay here, and then take them away in batches. As early as the first time, the First Army had already warned the residents that the road ahead was dangerous, and it is best not to go south. As long as they wait in the town for a few days, the Grey Fort Army will escort them to leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not everyone will believe this. In fact, the fish balls have encountered embarrassing escapers on several occasions, or the food is exhausted. , or be chased by the beasts to go nowhere. However, this is a lucky end, and those who are more unlucky, die silently in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this time, the fish balls noticed something different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the half slope, the town has been sparsely populated, but now there are many more people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which big city is this collapse?" Hansen, the detective of the same team, whistled. "In just ten days, there are more." With so many refugees, we can be busy now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish balls are also very exciting, only a thousand or so before rushing for a month or two This may be enough to tie the game and even surpass the previous results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is not sure why these refugees do not choose other good ways to go, but to come to this small town at the bottom of the valley, but just come The First Army has an obligation to take them to a safe place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the thought of this, everyone’s footsteps can’t help but speed up a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The downhill is much easier than going uphill. After more than half an hour, the team has arrived at the campsite of Fengshuang Town. The refugees in the town also noticed their arrival. Many people flocked to the streets and quickly gathered into a stream of people, heading for their direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These people... are too eager." Someone joked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you say that let them wait in town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It won't be eaten up. I hope I can get some food from us?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence has won the approval of most people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it’s a crash in a nearby city, it’s normal to not have enough food," the fish ball quickly decided. But this is not good for us to count the number of people and maintain order, we still have to stop them. Ten people and me set the card, others are responsible for the alert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is well aware of the terrible situation after the tide of people is out of control. If they can't block the refugees and ask to become robbed, these people will not be too different from the bandits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the time, these two types of people are only one line apart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soldiers quickly dispersed and held the gun behind them in their hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the distance between the two sides approaches, the figure of the refugees becomes clearer and clearer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish ball lifted the loudspeaker and shouted to the maximum volume. "This is the first army rescue team of the Grey Fort. Please don't panic, stop immediately." Take the next step and stay in place to follow the next step. We have plenty of food and medicine, but we need everyone's cooperation! Repeat it and stop, otherwise we will take compulsory means!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd was slightly hesitant, but soon ran again, as if the back was driven by what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish pill frowned, let the teammates point the gun at the sky, ready to fire a gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, Hansen gave a whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咦?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong?" asked the fish ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Squad leader, their costumes seem a bit strange..." Hansen said with a lookout mirror. "You have seen a fugitive with a roll Is it cloth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women?" The fish balls suddenly became inexplicable. He grabbed the lookout and looked at the crowd - the distance between the two sides was almost the same. There are still three hundred meters, and the lookout mirror can roughly see the other's clothing and things. From the point of view of dressing up, this is indeed a bunch of fugitive fugitives. As the investigators said, most people have a long or short strip of cloth, some with their backs on the back and some hanging on the back. I feel strange when I look at the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refugees will bring all the property they can bring before they flee. This is human nature. The First Army usually asks them to abandon their bags and put them on the road, but it will not bring trouble and inconvenience to the migration. For example, Jinlong will not interfere in principle. These two months of fish balls have also seen a lot of weird "family wealth", but the cloth strips are still seen for the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the more you look at it, the more he feels wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of refugees seem to be wearing a ragged dress, and they are all wearing shoes at their feet. And those rotten clothes are not old at all, but they are like the destruction in the near future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance between the two sides has been drawn to within 200 meters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呯""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teammates issued a warning shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd suddenly blasted and the scene of the blood coagulation of the fish pill appeared - probably shocked by the gunshots, several people in the head flustered The cloth was opened, and the cloth rifle was the standard rifle used by the First Army! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move seems to have caused waves in the crowd, others have done it, and those strips of different lengths are used to hide weapons. Means, wrapping things underneath from Sabre to Changchun, can be described as everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly realized that this is a trap! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Return to the camp!" Fishball shouted to his teammates, "Run!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice has not fallen, there has been a burst of gunshots over there! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fish balls even heard the bullets flying over the ears, the grass around them splashed a bunch of mud from time to time, and the other nine people reacted and turned around. The cat rushed toward the camp--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team had camped there several times, although there was no shovel, but the simple sandstone camp still existed. It was originally built to fight against the possible devils, but now it is the only cover on the empty hillside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fish balls even climbed into the camp, there was no standing teammate in the venue, compared to the non-stop shots on the opposite side. The counterattacks in the camps are very fragmented. Compared with the nine people who set up the cards, the team of more than 40 people is obviously a more eye-catching target. When they think that they are likely to encounter the shots without any precautions, the heart of the fish balls Mentioned the eyes of the blind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
