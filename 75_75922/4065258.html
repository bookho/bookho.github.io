			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron axe was not as furious as he expected, and even the changes in expression were hard to see, which made Thuram slightly surprised. I remember that in the past, this mixed-race will never allow anyone to threaten Princess Aosa, even if it is verbally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but look at the drow. Silver Moon, found that the goddess also did not react, as if it did not care about their own safety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are these two people thinking? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram touched the stone of God's punishment in his arms, and his fierce look on his face was a bit stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I didn't hope that you would defeat the watchdog. I didn't do it eight years ago, I know how much your guts are... at least Far less than your tone," the iron axe said slowly. "And I came back this time, not just to revenge the Iron Whip clan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The first half of the other party poked his pain, and the latter half gave him a slight glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only for revenge?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will challenge the six clan to let Aosha became the head of the clan." Iron Axe said one word at a time. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Tieshan clan manages this oasis together, there is still a status between the clan and the clan - the strongest has the best area in the city, this is The truth of the world. If you want to climb to this position, you must challenge the clan in front of you. For the one that has nothing, it is natural to defeat all six clan to occupy the core area of ​​Tiesha City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the idea that a madman will have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the top can not be interrupted, just the physical exertion of the six games of Lien Chan can be desperate, not to mention the first-class Mo Jin Warriors. Generally speaking, after a sacred duel, the warriors in the tribe will take more than half a year to recover. As for those who have died, they have to be retrained or recruited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the more resources, the thicker the underlying. It is necessary to know that the first fan of today's clan has not let the first position in decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Avengers are a very difficult person to classify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have some screams, and some have lost everything; as for the hesitancy or simply giving up during the preparation process, it is everywhere. So they may be half dead, dead, or dead... but there is no doubt that the madman must be the last. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing to talk about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram found that his interest in finding fun disappeared without a trace, and revenge on the iron whip could be said to be self-sufficient, with the entire Iron Sands City For the enemy? The news is just that you can make him restless. In order to avoid getting burned, he shouted directly, "Children, grab this guy and join the woman!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a total of four people in the room, Plus the two guarded outside the door, all holding the sharp edge and the god stone. Six-on-two battles, plus before entering the door, they have been taken away from the weapons, even if the iron axe is stronger, it is impossible to escape from here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Killing the mixed-race, and then giving the Aosha descendants to the Iron Whip clan, you should get a lot of rewards, he thought, maybe you can become this small Oasis watchdog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Princess Aosha also stood up, she gave a sneer chuckle, then opened the hood and solved the layer on the face. Thin veil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair is scattered, beautiful, and the man is right, she is indeed a goddess, but...not the Zall Silver Moon familiar to Thuram. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No woman in the sand can have as much snowy skin as her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long black hair is like a waterfall, and the golden eyes are shining with danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-haired goddess did not use weapons, but her fists were even more powerful than the hammers. With a muffled sound, the people who hit the attack directly flew out and smashed through the walls of the wooden boards. The building fell to the first floor! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he asked this sentence, the second person There was also a hole in the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub suddenly blasted the pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold wind rushed in and let the fire sway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goddess keeps on foot, one stroke and one style is like dancing with the wind, the shadow that is magnified by the fire makes Thuram feel chilly, why? Shouldn't they all wear the stone of the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of gemstone bought from the Grey Fort Kingdom should be able to make ordinary people have a reaction when facing the goddess, but why is it in front of her like nothing? ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth clan also spit blood down, and the other side kicked his back into the spine, almost folding his body into Two paragraphs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the four-winged eagle’s dive, I’m afraid it’s just that! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can hold a round in front of her. After counting the numbers, there are only three iron axes, goddesses and Thuram left in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All for Laozi, there is something on the second floor of the pub!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is the patriarch? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Damn, how are you guarding the door!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a guest being killed "!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The footsteps rang a rush of footsteps. Obviously many people are coming to the patriarch’s room, but the tip of a long knife has arrived. Thurham's neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not come in!" He had a cold sweat on his forehead, and he couldn’t take the razor of the blade and yelled at the door. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The patriarch?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You all roll me down! Immediately!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram’s sad discovery, the iron axe is right, his courage is indeed much smaller than the tone, facing the threat of death, he first thought of It is a compromise, not a struggle. Perhaps from the beginning, he was not a dead person with a hope of rebirth, but a half-dead who looked after the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now can we talk about it?" The tone of the iron axe still hasn’t changed much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I promise you what is the use! The watchdog here is supported by the Iron Whip Clan and the Shaping Clan. Now it’s such a big move, you I thought I could still win them? Wait until tomorrow, Tiesha City will know the news!" Thuram whispered. "At this time, I even got married, and most of them have become slaves of other families." Even if you are willing to come back, you can't stop the warriors trained by the big clan - if you don't want to die without a place of burial, you can't escape from the oasis now!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I said before, I didn't expect you to defeat the watchdog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean when Thuram bites his teeth? If he really has such a strong strength, he can become a challenger directly... Why do you have to do more? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless - unless the forces behind him are not in the extreme! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea just emerged, and the old patriarch’s heart raised a sense of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the other party needs to use the name of the clan to initiate the sacred duel? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, two loud thunders sounded outside the window, and the sound was not loud, as if it came from far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
