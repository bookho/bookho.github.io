			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knocked on the table and the hall was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When the end of the demon month, next year will be the most important year for the Grey Fort," he stood up from the main seat and walked behind the crowd step by step. "I will unify the whole territory and hold the ceremony to become the king of the gray castle." You, will also be my first organ of ministers, help me to govern this country together."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If placed two years ago... This "grand ambition" will only be regarded by everyone as the arrogance of the four princes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was a year ago, it was a distant goal that you could try hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But today, no one will doubt Roland’s words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd stood up, the right hand raised their chest, bowed to him and said, "This is my honor, kneel!" Their complaints and preparedness are scattered. Going a lot, the face reveals an excited look - the longer you stay in the city hall, the more you understand the power of the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undoubtedly, as long as he made this decision, it would be undisputed to include the entire gray castle in the rule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they can follow the majesty and become the most powerful group of people in the kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pressed the palm of his hand and told everyone to sit down. "More than that, the scope of the Grey Fortress will become unprecedented, west to wild, east to The fjord islands, to the endless Cape in the south, to the Hermes Plateau in the north, will follow my will!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Want to achieve this The First Army will undoubtedly be the busiest department next year. No winter city can only leave a small number of guards stationed. Therefore, exploring Daxue Mountain is a necessary measure to eliminate hidden dangers. I don't want the backyard to catch fire. Wang has suffered from unknown origins. The enemy attacked!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, perhaps we can enter the snowy mountains by the First Army and the Witch Alliance alone..." Carter whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a hole without light, terrain and complexity, the gun can have a very limited effect," Roland interrupted his words. "There There is no preset blocking location, and there is no map for reference. If you encounter a mixed species, how much casualties do you think the First Army needs to fight to defeat those monsters?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief knight is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the reason we must cooperate and explore - Tahira's godly witch and witch alliance can complement each other, and the first army is responsible for the break. Exploring the main entrance to establish a guard post to ensure the smooth flow of the retreat path, this is the most secure approach." Rolandton suddenly, suddenly increased the volume a few points, "you have listened, don't tell me to implement this How difficult is the plan, you are sitting here to solve the problem! If you can't do it, the City Hall does not need people who can't reach my request!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that he would look to the head of the town hall, "Bavr. Mons!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty!" The latter made a shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there still a problem with the final accounts and logistics?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think...no, "The boss has wiped the sweat on his face. "I will come up with a plan after five days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three days." Roland is unquestionable, then He turned his attention to the Minister of Agriculture, "Seni Dali!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"在!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The food stock is not enough, it is transferred from the long song area, the cement ship is more, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Compliance, obey, squat! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carl Vabert!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I will carefully check the mining area and The stability of the formation of the kiln group ensures that there will be no collapse accidents.” The Minister of Construction quickly said on his own initiative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, all the problems were solved. When the Minister realized that his mind had been decided, the task was quickly assigned and no one dared to drag again. One sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finalizing the specific responsible person, the next step is to determine the starting team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Pasha’s voice rang directly in his mind, the crowd was once again panicked, so Roland’s calm and tentative monsters talked to the minister. They found a solace, and finally did not make a shameful move to jump out of the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably think that anyway, I have already promised to squat, and my heart is closed. The ministers of various departments have buried their heads and put on a look of contemplation. In fact, it is to avoid the eyes of the tentacle monsters, as if the voice is not an ordinary conversation, but a hell of the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Roland is a little bit smirking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only flat-view light curtain of Isis became the most visible one in the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even some time, she will try to learn to talk to the high-level witches of Tacula like Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barov also looked up several times, and did not seem to want his opponent to be so eager to grab the limelight, but never able to open a sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Roland has long been planning on this, and does not need the excessive participation of the City Hall. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Takira agreed to send fifty gods to fight the witches, fighting alongside the main fighters of the Witch Alliance. The first army was commanded by Brian and divided 500 people. Participate in this action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining troops stationed in the Winter City were handed over to Carter for temporary takeover and continued to guard against the wicked harassment of the border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reaching an agreement on the exploration plan, Roland is preparing to end the bilateral talks, and Isis suddenly raised her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I applied to join the Snow Mountain Discovery Team and go to the Daxue Mountain in the West with the First Army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barov took a slap in the mouth. "You are neither a witch nor an army soldier. Don't mess up your sire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I used to be a swordsman in the Cavaliers camp. It is very difficult for the average person to hold five rounds in my hands. The evil beast is no exception. I have the ability to protect myself." She is not moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland asked curiously, "What is the reason for the application?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Battle of God is away from us Closer and closer, but there are few ministers who can sit and say what the devil looks like, what the aliens look like. Even if the opponent knows nothing, how can you help you manage the town hall? Some people will I feel that it is the first army, and the department in charge of it has nothing to do with the war of gods. But the fact is that until the war, both the Ministry of Construction and the Ministry of Agriculture will be involved in the war and serve the war. Only by knowing the characteristics of the enemy and knowing who you are fighting with can you better share the business for you." Itis snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You..." The boss wants to refute, but for a moment he doesn't know where to start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but raise his mouth. This is an interesting statement. Although some words are arrogant, it suddenly raises a thought in his head - if you can Her practice has become a default rule, that is, if you want to go further on the road to power, you have to transfer to the front line or the battle city to get a promotion qualification. Maybe it is a good idea. In this way, at least the officials of the City Hall will not be allowed to despise the war of fate, nor will they unreasonably issue some ridiculous and unrealistic decrees. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Isis does have the ability to fight, so that she can follow the first army without any harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he nodded to the North Pearl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, get ready to go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
