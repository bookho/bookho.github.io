			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What will the world be like after liberation?" Roland tried and said, "What good can you get? Get rid of the ideology and become a physical existence?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be honest, I don't know." He laughed. "But no matter what, it's better than being permanently banned here." At least - the future is full of possibilities."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stared at her for a while, the other person's look was very natural, as if to make a very common choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is little hope of finding a flaw in the dialogue through dialogue. He wonders, unless he can bring the nightingale into the world of dreams. The next inquiries also received little gain, and the answer to the gods was silent, and she could not help the battle of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or even limited by the rules of the dream world, she can only act as a martial artist here, secretly passing information is the limit. According to Zhai, different regions in the ideology have different rules, and even if it is a god, it is difficult to tamper with. It is with this in mind that she can get a breather and look for the savior who can stop the battle of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before this is completely over, she is not really free – the shackles that bind her are still there, and it’s possible to have her at any time. Try to be nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he sent the door to the store, Roland asked the last question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, you didn't expect me to open a coffee shop at the beginning. Is there really a place for a rose cafe in this city?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," he said with a slight smile. "It’s in Prism."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I have asked Garcia clearly-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cafe is located in the middle of the city, only the martial arts associations can enter there. I already knew the association After you get a hunting license, you can get through the central area after you get it. But what I didn't expect is that you didn't have any interest in the association. You haven't been to Prism City for so long." "By the way, the central containment of the core of the demon is at the bottom of the city. Usually only the guards and the above characters can enter and exit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; It turns out that this is the case... Roland finally knows why he always can't search for the agreed place, and the emotional rose cafe is Between welfare facilities designed for internal personnel also have to be senior figures in the job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The next meeting - I mean, in which cafe if it is necessary? After all, there are two roses now."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s still a good place," she looked at the towering tower and said softly, "Jiacia lives in this building? It’s good to see it occasionally. I Ah... maybe I like it here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe? Do you not know if you like it or not? Roland raised his eyebrows and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the farewell, the back of the cockroach gradually disappeared into the streets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is leaning against the door of the store to digest the huge information he got from this conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the dream world or the real world, it seems to have become more and more clear, magic, god, ideology, light, bottomless... Words are no longer just a simple concept, but are connected together through newly acquired information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he meditates, he suddenly feels a strange tremor across the body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland jerked his head up and found a twisted ripple in front of him, as if there was an endless transparent wall that swept across the street. And after passing him, he quickly expanded to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the situation? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the rest of the community with some surprises, and those aunts and aunts didn’t seem to notice the difference, just still laughing and laughing. Do your own thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing wrong, Roland clenched his fists, a change that only he could feel – and its volatility was quite like the heaven and earth induction that he produced when he recovered the core of magical creatures. Although the former made him feel comfortable and his body was full of warmth, the latter made him feel a little uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there something that has impacted the world of dreams before such a vision emerges? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, he has left, he has not gone to Prism City to receive the association-specific mobile phone, or maybe he can ask something from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pressed the distracting thoughts, locked the door of the cafe, and returned to the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He intended to interrupt the connection with the dream and return to reality. Who knows that just opened the door of 0825, he saw that the shoes of Jieluo are still In the entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He couldn’t help but have a conversation with him. He also said that he had more than an hour. He had already passed the school time. Why did Jielu not go out? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking into the living room, Roland was surprised to see that the little girl was lying on the ground motionless, and there were two broken cups around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hurried to the other side, kneeling down Live the other's wrist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pulse is still beating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at each other's face again - I saw Jielu's eyes closed, his brows slightly picked up, his cheeks flushed, as if he was enduring any pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland tried to touch her forehead, and there was a sense of scalping in her palm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is... in a fever? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of her fall, it was probably when she was cleaning up the coffee table and suddenly lost her balance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, she is still coming well tomorrow morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland’s high-hanging heart also fell a lot, and it’s better to be sick than to be attacked by the demon. When I saw the little girl falling down, he almost thought it was the gods who sent their hands to seek revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not hesitate to pick up the other side, three steps and ran down the building in two steps, one into the van. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the bumps made Jieluo recover a little bit of consciousness, she opened her eyes and whispered low, "I broke the table... cup ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, I will Lose...your, don't chase me...go to the country."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy... is it burnt? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put her on the co-pilot position and then fastened her seat belts. "Close your mouth, don't say anything."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he pulled out and started the car, Jie Luo suddenly reached out and grabbed his sleeve. "Uncle... Don't go."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This appearance is the first time I saw a little girl who was always looking at him. Looking at the other side's almost pleading look, Roland couldn't help but think of the words she wrote in her diary. It was probably because of the high fever that made her confused, only to reveal her most vulnerable side, and how her family treated her in the past. He thought that he couldn't help but sigh. "Reassure, your rent has not been paid, I will not let you go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen In this sentence, Jielu slowly closed his eyes, but the hand still did not let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being sent to the hospital, it was a toss, registration, diagnosis, hospitalization, hanging water... The basic set is basically afternoon, although the condition has not been ascertained. The state of the little girl is stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until the evening, the attending doctor found him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
