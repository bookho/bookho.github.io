			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No winter castle, in the conference hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressions of the representatives of the parties are not very good-looking, especially the love of Gesha and Felice - the news from the high-level devil is undoubtedly subversive Their past cognition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step by step from the light to the edge of the mainland, the resistance of the struggle for nearly a thousand years, countless people buried in the blood, but found that the enemy has not done their best. At the other end of the vast land, there is still a place called Tianhaijie, where the monsters are not weaker than the devil. The reason why humans are not extinct is because they drag the hands and feet of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is definitely a heavy blow to the belief of the Taqila witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dignified atmosphere even infected the Witch Alliance and the Sleeping Curse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This initiative to attack the outpost, it seems that the results are extremely brilliant, the battle damage ratio is the best record in four hundred years, but it is not at all in the devil Knowing the opponent and making it happen in accordance with the ideal rhythm of the first army, the next time you can get the same big win is still unknown. As long as the casualties are more than a few percent, the human beings who have lost a large area of ​​land and population want to completely eliminate the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe these are made by the other side," Wendy couldn't help but stand up and cheer. "After all, no one has ever dabbled in the end of the mainland, who knows Is it true or false? Before I get it, I don’t think I have to worry about it. What do you say?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are very few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha cast a grateful look on her, "Although Cabradabi’s words are exaggerated, to be honest, I don’t think it It’s all lying, especially the part that was revealed in the early days of the soul transfer. At that time, its ability to control the body was almost zero. The words spoken were basically the words of thought, and Zoe should be able to feel it. The words of almost proverbs can be mutually confirmed with the following content, unless it is brewing this lie a few years ago and training itself for a long time, otherwise it is impossible to do this."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mean inheriting fragments?" The book scrolled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes. If I didn't understand it correctly, any fragment of the inheritance of the race - that is, the relics of the gods - can be upgraded." Shah said slowly, "If the devil has the ability to beat us and seize the relics, how can he let go of this opportunity? So there is only one explanation, they really can't make it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inference is obviously more than one person thinks - according to the time arrangement, the devil is no different from the uncivilized barbarian in the early days of the first battle of the gods, facing the human kingdom of the scattered sand, dozens of dozens In the years, the underground civilization also found humans at that time. By the time the second red moon falls, the enemy suddenly becomes terrible, and the Federation has lost the fertile plains for more than a decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the upgrade can get such a big advantage, how do you think the devil should destroy human beings as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We really underestimated the strength of the devil," Felice said. "I want to come. For four hundred years, the federation has never Twilight has taken a look outside. We are always staring at the familiar land under our feet, but we don’t know anything about the world outside the mainland. Not to mention the Tianhai world at the end of the land, even the other end of the light, we are not even Understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? What is the other end of the continent?" Roland asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have only seen it in ancient books. It is said to be a very ridiculous land. There are mountains and cliffs everywhere, and the average height is far above the dawn. Felice recalls, "There are hundreds of miles apart, connected by a rising mountain range, and surrounded by the rising and falling seas. Usually half of the mountains are submerged in the sea, until the ebb tide The whole picture, according to legend, the devil is from the invasion of the light through it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc., this describes why it sounds so familiar, as if you have seen it before... ...he touched his chin, and suddenly a flash of light flashed through his mind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering continental shelf, the boundless cliffs, and the huge stone gates embedded in the cliffs - although there is no last item, the previous description and the Thunder The sights seen in the shadowy waters have striking similarities. Was the expedition seen at the time, the mainland opposite the light? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
