			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town regained its calmness after repulsing the troops of Tiffco. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland selected three people from the City Hall Department of Education, plus two teachers to form a team, with a copy of Soroya's books to the long song fortress. No matter how effective it is, he finally took the first step on the assimilation fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyro is not good at commanding the battle, but it does perform well in the administration. In just one week, two thousand road repairers are recruited by the Cavaliers. The next 66 continues to the town. If it were not for the second batch of ten groups of kiln put into production, Roland did not dare to make up his mind to establish a hard road between the two places. Now, he finally has a chance to squander. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This road was named Roland by Roland, and was under the responsibility of the Minister of Construction, Karl. His structure is exactly the same as that of the town, and it is a layer of cement stabilized gravel. In the age of no heavy vehicles, such roads are sufficient for transportation tasks. Moreover, the drainage performance is good, and asphalt or concrete can be added in the future depending on the situation. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the construction materials, four steam-driven mills replaced the manpower and crushed the stone, producing dozens of tons of crushed stone every day. The weak transportation capacity has restricted the further increase in production. So many stones require more than 100 people to take a horse-drawn carriage for one day before they can be sent to the construction site. If it is a later road, the main road slag truck can be transported in one car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the four-seat clay brick firing in the furnace area, the other blast furnaces have been put into the production of cement powder, after many component tests and iron supply from the mine. Powder, the cement produced in the town today is far superior to the original batch of products, both in terms of quality and stability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the squadrons carrying gravel and cement powder have also brought a lot of negative impacts on the town. The most serious problem is dust. Until the afternoon, only a little scratching the wind, you can see the dense dust floating in the sky, the street has turned pale yellow. Although most townspeople don't mind this situation, there is nothing worse for Roland than to close the doors and windows on a hot summer day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a quick addition of a cover to the carriage carrying the cement and gravel to reduce the scattering during transportation. At the same time, under the promotion of the ability of the leaves, the town was covered with shade in just a few days, and the leafy sycamore trees were arranged symmetrically along the street, looking green and looking. This problem was quickly improved by the fact that Roland called for all democracies to sprinkle water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The straight-line distance between the two places is less than 70 kilometers, but considering the road to avoid the foothills of the extremist mountains, the total length of this road It is almost 100 kilometers or so, and the construction period is expected to be one year. With quality roads, some vehicles can come in handy – like bicycles and steam cars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his conception, exhibition education or road construction is a measure that connects the two places together, just like the towns and cities that are strongly promoted by later generations. The same. After the land between the two places is opened, Changge Fortress and Bianbu Town will merge into one huge city. If he can turn the hills at the southern end into a part of the city and then open the edge mountains, they will even have a estuary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, exploiting so much land requires more people, and in order to cope with a possible future war, the city must be self-sufficient in agriculture, Can provide a large number of workers for industrial production. Under the preliminary calculation, he needs to introduce about 100,000 people, and the largest city in the gray town, Wangdu, is only about 20,000 to 30,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has set his sights on the northern and southern parts of the Grey Fort. Both places have experienced wars. When the winter falls, it is likely that there will be a large number of food shortages. refugee. Simply provide food for hunger and warm accommodation and you will be able to absorb them into Bianbu Town. Even the refugees of the winter and the wolf heart are also considered by him. To this end, he also wrote a letter to the merchant Margaret, let her help inquire about the situation in these two countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After writing the recent exhibition plan, the prince folded the paper The drawer, stretched out, decided to go to the Anna room to see how her lens was cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since understanding Soroya’s evolutionary reasons, he intends to make a microscope that can observe the structure of cells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can see the wonderful microcosm with your own eyes, it may lead to more witches evolving new abilities, and if they are not good, they will arouse their interest in learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
