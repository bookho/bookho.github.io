			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wangdu! After a year and a half, he is back! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barov looked at the clear blue stone wall, and his heart was stirring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he has not calmed down since he received the order, and His Royal Highness defeated Tiffco as expected, and he did so. Clean and neat, the results prove once again that no one can resist the army of the Western lords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is not appropriate to call Roland a lord of the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is now the only son of Wimbledon III, the blood inheritor, the legal heir to the royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obstacles to the throne have been swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is foreseeable that Roland will soon be crowned king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he will also become the prime minister next to the king under power... This joy makes Barov immersed in the boundless delusion - What kind of expressions would you reveal when those "old friends" who remembered their own climbs and climbed into the high places they couldn't think of? Shocked, embarrassed, envious, even if you bite your teeth, you have to be strong and laugh, desperately please? These scenes are just a matter of thinking and making him happy. If you can let your former mentor, Finance Minister Lauren Moore see this scene is even better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cement boat is slowly docked at the outskirts of the dock, and Barov walks off the trestle. Together with the peers of Camo Spoel and others, under the escort of the First Army soldiers, they passed through the familiar streets and entered the inner city palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Twin Towers Palace is still as majestic as it is in memory. He used to be able to look far into the huts of the City Hall, but now he can walk straight into the palace. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went straight to the high tower study, and he saw Roland Wimbledon again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baroph squats on one knee with excitement: "Your Majesty, the Grey Fort Kingdom is yours!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, there is still no place. Dongjing and Beidi are still the remnants of Tefco's remnants." Roland smiled. "Get up, we still have a lot of important things to talk about." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His expression is as always, the tone is calm, and it is easy to be close to people, as if it is completely unaffected by the imminent king. Barov’s attitude was more respectful. He slowly stood up and raised his chest. “Yes, Your Majesty.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The current task in the first place is to maintain the king. All work, I have already explained this in the letter," Roland poured a cup of hot tea and handed it to him. "Do you have a preliminary plan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Barov quickly took over the teacup. "It’s not difficult to just keep the current order. You can hand over the little nobles to me. They will know the pros and cons. And I also brought ten from Bentham. Some of the most outstanding disciples, some are proficient in business, some are good at taxation, even if I am not here, they are staring at the city hall, the nobles can not steal any oil." He paused, added, "but You have to let the left-behind army cooperate with their supervision work, without the use of force to protect, it is difficult for supervision to play its due warning role."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looks Some accidents, "Do you want to stay in the king?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not, Next, Barov replied without hesitation. "The government without winter city is complicated and important. I can't leave it too long. If you handle these trivial things yourself, it will be too laborious. Please let me Continue to manage the Winter City Hall for you. It is my right thing to work with you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought very clearly, since he No Winter City is the new capital of the Grey Fort, so it will sooner or later surpass the city - now the population and development potential of the former have already left the king, and with the launch of a new recruitment plan, its scale is undoubtedly It will surpass any big city in the four kingdoms. Staying in Wangdu can certainly experience the sorrow of those "old friends," but it will be annoying when you listen too much, and these sorrows will not bring power, but will gradually move away from the center of power. Only when he often appears in front of Roland’s majesty can he be deeply impressed, and Barov knows this well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
