			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, when Tilly saw four tired faces, The heart that has been hanging has finally been put down. From their gray-faced appearance and strong smile, it can be seen that although this trip is not lacking in accidents and thrills, it is safe in general - it can be retired in the wrong direction and discovered by a large number of devils. It is already lucky enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looking at the ashes without remorse, she was not angry with her, and the comfort of her mouth became a hard blame. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't expect someone who had been in the wild to fight through the battle, and even the direction could not be distinguished." The five kings did not have a good air, "the year How did you get from Hermes to the Grey Kings? It’s really rare to go directly to the South."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...that When there is often a chase for the church, I will know when I catch the question. "The ash is a hand," and this time I feel that the deviation is not too far, at least I can see the remains of Takira, if they are large-scale. I can always notice..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Without enough red fog, they will not be able to move out on a large scale - we must guard against raids initiated by fearful beasts. And this view can only see their tails at most!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Everyone is safe and sound is an ideal result, and this position may not be imagined That's so bad," Passa interjected. "Roland has sent back the first witches yesterday, including Sylvie. The warning problem has been solved. This rear perspective can also help us judge the size of the enemy and the reinforcements. So... go back to rest first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?North There is news on the other side?" Ashes raised his eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Otherwise it’s not just that I said that you are two simple words," Tilly snorted. "That's really... go!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait," Ashes paused, first looking at Pasha, and then a glimpse of a smile, only to come over to her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, nothing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the Witch Building, Tilly just closed the door and was hugged by the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let you worry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is Pasha telling you this? "Tilly did not return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you guessed it?" The latter was slightly stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at your expression, I know what is going on." She opened her ashes. "If I didn't guess wrong, Pasha said It should be that I have not rested for a few days. Most of the time I stayed at the core of the magic, I am uneasy, so that you don't mind my attitude, come back and comfort me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...very powerful, all in the middle." Ashes exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, apologize?" She turned back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No." The extraordinary witch shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No?" Tilly widened her eyes. "So I am worried that it is right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "How can I say that I can't let you go to the dangerous place? This is the decision I have made."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ember, what are you?" I don't understand," Tilly was mad at the time. "The risk can be calculated, measured, and evaded. The performer is part of the calculation - even if the plan is perfect, the bad performer will let The situation has become a mess, understand? If it is me, the bridge break operation is simply not dangerous!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calculate, measure, evade...you talk More and more like Roland Wimbledon," Ashes shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the accident is unpredictable, even if the chances of it happening are very small, I hope that I will bear it - after all, there are too many accidents in my life." The ash leaned down and put his hands on Tilly's shoulder. Because of the height difference, she only has the ability to look at the other side. "The reason for not apologizing is also very good. Since I choose to stay here and fight with the devil, I will get more and more dangerous situations. If I can’t come back. Isn't that owing a lot of apologies?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen to me Said, "The expression of the ashes is incomparably serious." Compared to your brother, I can do very little. It is too difficult for me to think about the witch's way, so this is the only thing I am sure of. If you Willing to go back to the island, I can naturally promise not to worry you anymore, but not here. Of course, if you worry me, I will not apologize for you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly found that she did not know what to say, looking at the ashes of the black hair, she actually felt that the other party is inexplicably reliable at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not like this! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," she turned to the beginning. "This time, even if you will tell the whole thing in detail, I want to find out what the problem is." Where are you. Now go to the bath first, and the smell on your body will kill me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know it," Ashes breathed a sigh of relief," Do you want to wash with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Free talk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the extraordinary Tilly reached out her right hand and spread her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the ring was punctured has completely healed, and almost no signs of injury have been seen, but the sudden tingling is still fresh in memory until now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the situation that was worried did not appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably just too much for myself, she thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lojad wakes up from a long sleep, feels full There is an unspeakable comfort in the upper and lower, like a soak in the warm spring, dizziness and pain are missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s Nana Wa. Pine is back... She vaguely remembers what happened before she fell asleep, the lovely little girl panting Running into the room, it seems that I have not rested all the way. I saw that the first sentence I said was "Sit with peace of mind, and it will return to normal." In addition to her, there are partners of the adventure group, they are There was a lot of words on the bed, but she couldn't write it down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the feeling of Nana's magic flowing through her body is really comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now you are alright? I have to thank her very much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia opened his eyes, the first thing I saw was a gray-haired man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She swears, "Big... Chief?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am," Roland Nod, "How is the feeling of healing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't say it," she tried to move her finger, a little bit of oysters, and the consciousness conveyed Nothing, "It seems to be no problem. How long have I slept? Nana Va? And... your hand..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, just think It’s fun, don’t care,” Roland took his hand back from Luo Jia’s ear. “I’ve been curious about what it feels like to feel it, will it make you feel... um, it’s extraordinarily itchy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, that’s just the ear," Luo Jia said strangely. "If you don't dislike them, I don't care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she finished, she shook her long ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the time being," the chieftain coughed twice. "You slept for about three days. This is also the normal time for the body to heal after a serious injury. Of course not. It doesn't matter if you sleep, but it will be extra fatigue and discomfort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
