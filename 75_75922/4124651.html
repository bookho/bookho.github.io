			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor sits in a pub room without a winter city and looks at the latest trade bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the noisy hall downstairs, this is undoubtedly a high-end home. The floor is covered with woolen rugs, and there is a fire raft under the soft couch. From entering the room to lying down, the feet will not feel a chill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his request, the store also installed a movable wooden table next to the soft couch, which does not hinder the usual rest, and can be regarded as short when needed. Table use. Especially in the winter when the wind and snow roar, it is a pleasure to sit on the couch halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, on his left hand is a slice of golden chicken breast slices, and on the right is a cup of purple chaotic drink, regardless of taste, This meal is worth ten gold dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a bright jeweler, in fact, the four sons of Losa, these are huge expenses in the eyes of ordinary people, for him Words are nothing. It took him a subconscious move to spend a golden dragon and let himself enjoy the comfort brought by wealth. The value is not within his consideration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After visiting the giant mechanical show called "Train" two months ago, he bought a room on the third floor of the pub. , became his own business resident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, with his wealth, even if buying one or two properties is not difficult, but Victor prefers this feeling of detachment - both in one In the silence, you can feel the noise of the bottom. Compared to the big house that the traditional aristocrats like, he always has a yearning for places like pubs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only to facilitate business negotiations with various caravans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If something is most intuitive in reflecting the vitality of a city and the prosperity of its business, it must be a pub in downtown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last page, Victor closed the sheepskin in his hand and picked up the crystal clear drink. Under the illumination of the candlelight, the red liquid in the purple is like a beautiful gem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a little bit of trouble on the recent bill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why he has not received a gemstone in the West for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle for the king made the situation in the Grey Fortress change greatly, the city was destroyed in the war, the nobility no longer owns the land, and these changes make the price of luxury goods If you want to maintain your original profit, you must increase your sales. Without the original stone, the jeweler of his men could not change the gems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Long Song Fortress was originally a major source of his original stone, but after Roland Wimbledon announced the establishment of the Winter City, the source of the original stone became more and more scarce. He has visited the Changge District several times and found that all the mining areas there have been collected by the young kings. It is not surprising that the accumulation of money is the generality of the lord. Oddly, those outputs are transported to the border area. After that, it seems that they have disappeared from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, he has not found a jewelry store in Wintertown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either sell the original stone for profit, or invest a sum of money, make a jewel and profit, the lord's means are nothing more than these two. The former can earn the difference, while the latter can be sold in cooperation - whether it is the sales channel or further processing into jewelry, he has the strength that the other party can not refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king did not leave him with the door to intervention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like Roland Wimbledon doesn’t plan to use gems to make money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Victor a little bit annoyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also tried to sell the finished jewelry to the winter city without selling it, and the result was equally bad. It is impossible for civilians anywhere to use the expensive goods that are dozens of golden dragons. They have always been supplied to wealthy aristocratic families to meet their needs of showing off and comparing at the banquet. But there is no aristocrat in the traditional sense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, a huge new city, but lack of interest in jewelry, this is what he did not expect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly an unhealthy signal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of the train has made Victor realize that the future has arrived, but it is not evenly distributed - and in order to better expand the business, he naturally goes The place closest to the future. It is also his inevitable choice to shift the focus of business from the old king to the new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is what should I do without this industry in the future? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not short of money, even if he does nothing, he can enjoy a prosperous life. But he must prove his ability in the trade, so that the merchants of the family and the "black money" have nothing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't let his father down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Victor thought about how to solve this problem, the hum of the downstairs suddenly increased several times, and even the floor swayed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s still early in the night, it’s not a happy moment for the drinkers. What happened? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rang the brass bell calling the maid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me," soon a beautiful woman pushed the door and came in. "What do you have to order?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the door opened, the noise suddenly increased a lot, and he seemed to hear someone reading aloud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor pointed out the door, "What happened downstairs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry "Adult, are they arguing with you?" The maid smiled apologetically. "This is no way. After all, today is the day when newspapers are on sale, everyone is rushing to buy it."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Report...paper?" he repeated awkwardly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, a notice was issued a week ago, saying that it would be used to replace the square's bulletin board. Everyone looked forward to it for a long time and wanted to see the newspaper. What is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, what's new? It’s a new king, and Victor has always had an interest. “How much does it sell?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I heard that one is ten copper eagle.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also buy me one...no, buy ten!" he said immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." The maid ran down the stairs for a short while, and soon ran back breathlessly. "Big, adults... sent over The newspapers have all been sold out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So fast?" Victor blinked in surprise, if it was a commodity, it was too I sold it a bit. But this is hard to beat him. It’s not just saving money. "Then buy it from the people you buy, money is not a problem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He licks his hand Throw a golden dragon into the arms of the maid, "As long as you can buy it, the rest is yours!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes! Adult!" The girl smiled and opened her way. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, six sets of gray-white newspapers were handed to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The price below has risen to twenty silver wolves, I have tried my best..." The maid period Ai Dao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this happen when someone sees a large acquisition? The other party's expression clearly exposed the thoughts of the bottom of the heart - although she did not complete the task, she was reluctant to hand over the rest of the money. Victor did not care. "What is your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exquisite, adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "You keep the money," he shook his newspaper. "In addition, can you watch this with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Food and wine are all there, so what is missing is naturally self-evident. The other side's chilling chest and the sweat that came out of the nose, all exude a youthful vibrancy, seeing aristocratic women, this slightly clumsy girl has a flavor. Moreover, the other party is a resident of the Winter City. If you encounter any incomprehensible things, you can ask her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
