			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the wedding of the chief knight Carter Lanis and the star of the West Star Mey was held in the castle garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the family members, there are also members of the Star Flower Troupe, the City Hall and the Witch Alliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this era, the marriage ceremony is generally held by the church. The wedding of the royal family is the witness of the regional bishop, then the ordinary aristocrats and wealthy businessmen, according to the status and wealth, Invite the priest or the main sacrifice to bless the door, while the civilians have to go to the church themselves, pay the fees of several silver wolves, and let the priest preside over the wedding for himself. Of course, you can't afford this price, and you can live together directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westernland now has no place for the church, the wedding host is naturally replaced by the town hall, in the Roland plan, the city hall will send officials free of charge The marriage certificate was issued and both parties were registered. This time, Carter’s wedding was an excellent publicity model. He even thought about the slogan, which was “convenient, legal and zero-cost”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mey appeared in the garden in a wedding dress, the scene sounded amazing, although she is not a witch, but the unique temperament of being a big-name actor is still Attracting everyone's attention, even Roland had to feel, Carter's vision is really good. If it is not for better publicity, and the Cavaliers’ repeated requests, he is really reluctant to take out the wedding dress early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the other protagonist of the wedding, Carter Lannis, wearing a black dress, the same temperament, plus his careful care The handsome face, standing alone, is a perfect match. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They look really good," Anna exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We will have this day sooner or later," Roland squeezed her hand gently. "Everyone will know your name by then."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," she smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s easy to marry a witch, but it’s very difficult to get the approval of most of the people. It’s not that you have absolute power or a high reputation. at this point. Therefore, the most basic thing is to wait until the kingdom's civil war subsides, and he becomes the king of the well-deserved gray castle and then Anna will come over - he does not want others to think that Anna is just a witch who hides himself as a plaything, just like the past nobles did. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland believes that this day will not be too far, the demon month is over, the town is about to prepare for the spring offensive, and it will soon be a thunderous The blow will fall on Tiffco's head and completely crush his throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two exchanged tokens...hey, then..." The official from the City Hall was clearly not familiar with Roland’s new marriage process, he Looking down at the record book, "new people kissing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow..." There was a cry at the scene, members of the Star Flower Troupe, especially Irene. Excitedly grabbed the dawn and swayed around, and took other people to cheer for Mey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not just kiss your mouth," Lightning grinned. "Every time my adventure comes back, my dad will be kissed by the maids several times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕..." 茜 茜 蹲 她 她 她 蹲 蹲 蹲 蹲 蹲 蹲 蹲 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她 她Side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Highness, you set this process... Is it really good?" The book rolls the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Special case, not every newly married couple," Roland smiled. "After all, it is for propaganda, the more attractive the eyeball. "He said that he looked to Soroya. "You have to draw this moment in detail!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, give it to me," The latter looked at the two at a glance, and the magic pen in her hand sparkled, and she was also interested in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this step, Carter was obviously nervous. After a short while, Mey finally took the initiative to kick his feet and kiss him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garden suddenly sounded a round of applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
