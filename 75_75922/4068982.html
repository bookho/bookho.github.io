			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the order, the warriors of the Bone Clan immediately pulled out their weapons, and even the basic temptations were not done, and they were caught from both sides of the platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how well-informed they are, they always have only four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people can't even control the territory of their own half. When 22 people complete the encirclement, Aosha will fall into the predicament of being attacked by the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a warrior who lives on a duel, there will never be any concern in such a life-and-death struggle. From the moment they board the high platform, they will already Life is dedicated to the three gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is both a struggle for power and a fight for the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they heard the song of sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zall. Silver Moon’s humming moment overshadowed the roar of the fire and the roar of the black water of the Styx. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tune is ethereal and sweet, as if it came from a distant sky, but the loss, pain and mourning contained in it are as rich as the essence, and everything that is heard People can't help but want to drop their tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes the bones of the Warriors in the footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...stay!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you doing?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quickly stop, you are in the Holy Land!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Betrayal!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to kill you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onlooker suddenly changed his mind, and some pointed at the bone The clan screamed loudly, while others cried and cried, as if they had encountered something extremely sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuram can hardly believe his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the bone-cutting warriors retreating to their own people, and in the twinkling of an eye, they were splashed with hot blood, and the scimitar passed through the intestines. One by one, the head rolled off the stage, and his face was still full of horror and incredulity. Matching the sad music, it is like describing this amazing massacre. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, only a short moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he blinked again, the horror of the scene disappeared without a trace, and the twenty-two warriors were still approaching, but the pace was slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can't be slow, the people behind them should be their strongest support, and they are spiritually maintained. They were born and died for the clan, winning power, and the people cheered and shouted for them, and regarded them as heroes. Unfortunately, they are now completely reversed. The cries and roars of the tribes make them suspicious, together with other big clan who are in charge of Tiesa City. They also glared at them as if they had committed crimes that could not be forgiven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors are not afraid of powerful enemies, but they cannot ignore the reprimand of brotherhood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the power of the Principal? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but...how is it possible? Thuram is not the one who has never seen the power to control the people. For example, the Kabbah of the sandstone clan is a powerful goddess with similar ability, but he has never heard of the goddess can make this imaginary power beyond the ten steps. Ah! He touched the stone of the gods hanged on his neck and looked at the new owner, Zall. The position of the silver moon was far more than ten steps away from the observation deck. Those who were shirtless and obviously did not wear the stone. Is it because of her singing that people crying and crying? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that this question also exists in the hearts of the boneless warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a duel, this hesitation is fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything happens in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of taking the short bow behind her, she pulled out the feather arrow to the nearest duel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it was affected by the off-site, or the other party did not have a bow, so the vigilance was reduced, and the Warriors did not make the first response. When I saw the arrow that was no different from the arrow of the string and flew straight to them, it was too late to avoid it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four feather arrows are completely no less powerful than the strong bows! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every arrow is passed under the clavicle on the right side of the target, stuck in the bones, so that the gripper's dominant hand can no longer give a little strength, this It also caused the four people to completely lose their fighting ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a breach in the encirclement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reverberating song on the high platform suddenly turned, and the previous sad tunes suddenly became extremely stimulating, and the compact drums seemed to be knocking on each The heart is general, people can't help but boil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the ashes is like a shadow, once again showing her unreasonable power - clearly with the giant hammer and wooden shield, the pace is still flowing . Left hand block, right hand dance hammer, no one can stop her blow. Moreover, she did not use a hammer to smash a person, but to hold the hammer handle horizontally, ramming on the stage, and soon she fell six or seven people at her feet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people who have the advantage of the bone-cutting warriors has fallen into a dilemma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to disperse from the two wings, not to mention how to bypass the ash to fill the gap on the other side, just because this process will be pressed by Andrea's projection I can't breathe. Even if you use a shield to block your body, you will be nailed like a long-eyed arrow. As for the sacred arrow that is shot in a hurry, not only does it threaten the other side, but the stone that falls to the ground will be crushed by the iron axe that acts as a guardian - it is a precious thing worth dozens of golden dragons! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cancel the encirclement, it will make them lose their advantage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone, move closer to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably seeing this going, no The famous warrior shouted, and gathered more than ten people who could still stand around. At this time of the battle, everyone has seen it, although the ashes of the declaration are incomparably arrogant, but so far no one has died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she wants to kill, no one can stop the hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every warrior is a valuable asset of the clan, which has won the respect of the great spectator clan, naturally including the boneless duelists - they are not afraid Sacrifice, and willing to pay for the sacred duel, but that has meaning, not blind death. Mother Earth is not a murderer. She praises courage and strength, but does not want to see unnecessary death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warriors took their weapons back into their waists, and everyone squeezed into a row and stretched out their hands forward. The meaning is self-evident. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy smiles easily, throwing the wooden shield, flattening the long handle Hammer, rushing toward the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two forces are colliding together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stay on!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a messy shout on the watchtower, but did not point out the clan, as if this victory won No longer important, people just want to see a contest that shows bravery! The spectators who were still crying and screaming at the moment were clenching their fists one by one, and their eyes were staring at the center of the high platform. But Thurham did not feel anything strange at all - the drums on the field A wave higher than a wave, like a horn that urges everyone to go forward, makes every listener feel like a wave, as if they are not an audience, but a participant in this sacred duel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ash at this moment stretched into a slanting straight line, and the feet were bent back and forth, which actually formed a stalemate with the more than ten people of the bone-cutting clan. The muscles on her arms form a perfect arc, like the best interpretation of power and beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
