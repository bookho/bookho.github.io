He lazily put on his coat and planned to go to the outside water room to wash it, then come back to fill his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect to open the door, he saw a group of witches outside the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but see a scene like this. - There is no doubt that something big has happened in the league that will allow so many witch members who have not participated in the war to gather here. But because he is still in the dream world, everyone will wait at the door to wait for him. It is the end of the evil month, and the face of the nightingale is an excited expression. He asked subconsciously, "Someone evolved in adulthood?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a book! She is promoted to the superb!" The nightmare replied excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with a group of sly witches approaching the office, Roland saw everyone’s mouth "Superior", Felice and Anna are also present, three people around a stack of information, as if discussing something. Looking at the peaceful expression of the book, he almost thought that he was promoted to be a member of the group of cheerful witches in front of him, rather than a quiet and calm league teacher as usual. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So...what is the situation now?" he curiously said, "Is it true that the book is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three people also noticed his arrival, Felice took the lead. "I have already confirmed this with the balance of the magic stone. I am probably the first non-combat type in history. The extraordinary promoters - all her magical features have changed significantly compared to before. Although most of these improvements vary from person to person, there are no specific examples for comparison, but according to the practice of the Federation, she does have Qualification is called supernatural."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is your exemption?" The book smiled and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That can't be done," Felice said seriously. "In the era of the federation, you are likely to be a candidate for three seats. I am already rude." ——”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You also said, it’s the era of the federation,” the book interrupted. “In the Witch Alliance, everyone is a sister. And, I also like this easy name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, these things can be put aside," Anna inserted, "Now Roland is here too. Or, let's talk about the book's ability first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you had gone to the North Slope Lab." Roland smiled at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter also blinked in disarray. "It was originally planned, but the ability of the book is really special, so I changed the itinerary temporarily." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Special?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Anna said in a word, "She saw the dream The world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the story, Roland was surprised. eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come you finally came back?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am seeing those magnificent cities After the building, I suddenly thought of the dream world you described, and then I felt a lot of peace of mind.” The book slowly said, “I went back to the original cabin and tried to concentrate on thinking about leaving this room. When I opened my eyes again, I found that I returned to the castle office."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...good envy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that really a dream world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
