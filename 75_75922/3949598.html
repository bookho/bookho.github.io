			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto Losey left the office, the sound of the nightingale came from the side of his body. "He said that not all is true, especially before coming to Bianbu Town. Experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not surprisingly, he must have arrived at Wangdu first, and after he had negotiated with Feifeco, he transferred to the West," Roland smiled. Laugh, "If you go straight to me at the beginning, then it is a ghost. Two bets are the favorite thing the diplomat does. If it is me, it will not easily put the eggs in a basket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean...they don't necessarily stand on our side?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The decision will not be made immediately," he took a pot of hot water and refilled the cup. "How much do you think the morning lord would believe after receiving the news?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale stuck for a long time, "I don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Roland just finished talking on the shoulders. Was stunned, "... ...but one thing is obvious. The news sounds terrible, but it happens a few years later - even we can't give an exact date. And the church's threat is close at hand, maybe it will be after the spring Action, so the Lord of the Morning will not fall to us because of this intelligence, he will continue to be on the wall until I and Tefco have won the game. If there is spare power, he may also benefit both sides. In order to seek future returns."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a common practice for politicians. They are not willing to take too much risk and like to obtain benefits smoothly, especially war. Rewarding great investment projects. If there is no threat from the devil, Roland does not exclude deep contact with them, burying the trap and waiting for the other party to jump in, and then reclaiming more debts with the profits. But now he is not in the mood to play this kind of diplomatic game with the other party. In the next year, Bianyi Town must take the initiative to quickly stabilize the situation, a storm is about to sweep, and the fish in the pond are vying for food. There is only one dead road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That... can you tell the news out?" The nightingale did not understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At least the morning kingdom is not our real enemy. I donâ€™t know how much the nobles can believe in the news of the devil, but they will certainly spare no effort in the ambitions of the church. Propaganda, which is equivalent to weakening the foundation of the church's rule," Roland explained. "Once the public support is lost, it is not so easy for the church to quickly use the resources of the kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is to inform the other party of the information he has mastered, in fact he only revealed to Otto that the devil exists, and did not tell the news of the witch empire and the previous two battles of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former is more unbelievable than the devil's existence, and may even be counterproductive - because most of the folk areas are hostile to witches, this As long as you have a little guidance, you will probably become a "witch's conspiracy." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter is easy to combat the confidence of mankind against the devil. If the previous two were failures, what is the chance of winning the third time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, the seeds of joining hands against the enemy have been buried. As for whether or not the results can be harvested, it is necessary to look at the next reaction of the morning kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, Roland once again saw Otto Rossi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the meeting can be guessed from his lost eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I prefer to sign a covenant with you, but compared to the details of the covenant, the most important thing now is to send the news back to the morning as soon as possible," he said. Prayer, "So I am here to give you a word."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope you can hear your good news later," Roland nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Additionally... Your Highness," Otto took a moment, "I have another ruthless request."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please take care of Andrea Quin for me."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
