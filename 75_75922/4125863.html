			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This guy... is too arrogant," said the nightingale from the fog, "What does she mean by this!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, since the last time the Iron Axe handled the nobility and talked with the North Pearl, her attitude has changed faintly, as if giving The feeling of letting go of the self - although for Roland, there is nothing wrong with this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." He pondered for a moment. "Can you judge the authenticity of this sentence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s true," said the night, "At least I don’t lie on the point that I want you to pay attention to my body, or I will control her to ask for it."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If that's the case, then follow her." Roland laughed. "If everyone's thoughts have to be guessed, it's too tired. I don't have much energy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night that was still unfair was suddenly stagnation, and then pretended to be inadvertently turned away. "Say, say it is... usually worry about one." Two people are almost the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, you cover up the level, it is just putting your mind on your face. Roland tried to hold back the corner of the mouth that he wanted to lift, and cleared his throat. "So let's go back to the office. There is still a lot of work to be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp For example, two internal combustion engines that have passed the stereotype test will be put into use. The light source has only completed the first step, how to mass produce, and the production of matching mechanical equipment are the difficulties that need to be overcome. In addition, there are design and assembly of armored trains, production of bio-colloids, and expansion of more factories and military, etc...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but compared to Another thing, he can put aside these jobs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it does not have much meaning in itself, it is essential to condense public opinion after finishing this form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Livia arrived at the Winter City, it meant that the conditions before the ascension were all ready. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp One week later, the Winter Castle District was opened to the public for the first time. Under the guidance of the police and the guards, thousands of screened people gathered inside and outside the courtyard, excitedly waiting for the arrival of the new king. Outside the castle area, the streets are full of lights and crowds – even if the sky is still sporadic snow, it can't stop people's enthusiasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the ceremony, the Lord’s Castle was temporarily remodeled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer wall of the vestibule was demolished and replaced with a fence that did not obstruct the view; the furnishings in the yard were also removed and covered with flat grass. Just climb the castle area along the long slope and you will be able to see the entire ceremony venue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are long strips of red and black edges hanging from the sides of the castle, hanging from the roof to the ground. This color is especially outstanding in the snow-covered background. It’s eye-catching and adds a sense of weight to this not-so-magnificent castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest change comes from the second floor of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if overnight, a diagonal sill was built on the bare facade, leaving the second floor with a half-empty terrace. The front of the terrace faces the front door of the vestibule. There is no doubt that the king will accept the blessings of the people here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the designer, Minister Carl, knows that this fast-completed platform structure comes from the hands of the witch - Ms. Ai Gesha stretches out the ice wall on the castle wall Later, Miss Soroya "painted" a brick layer, which became a difficult part of the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such weather, a thick ice wall is enough to support a few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the castle is another scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, are you ready?" Wendy’s questioning came from outside the bedroom. "All ministers and guests have arrived, just waiting for you." Appeared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's wait... I'm still a little nervous," said the other party, Anna. She stood in front of the window sill and looked through the curtains to overlook the noisy crowd below. The blue eyes were full of waves. "You really want to Did you stand on stage with me? The ceremonial officer said that there has never been such a thing in the past enthronement ceremony."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn't have what he thought Fearless, Roland realized that although Anna had always used smiles to face each other, it was true that when this moment came, she still had concerns and confusion. The excellence in learning and the love of new knowledge have made her most confident. When she puts her mind and body into creation and manufacturing, she is more like a genius. But in addition to these auras, she is only a girl in her early twenties and grew up in a remote township. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s about to face the thousands of people now, it’s impossible to be nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Roland smiled and said in the softest voice, "Then I am the first to break the case. Or, you want to "I am going to give myself a coronation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not," Anna shook her head. "I am just..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stepped forward and hugged her with her open hand. "Then I have to change it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Change one...say ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," he took a breath and asked seriously, "Miss Anna, I want to hire you to be my wife, you are willing "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Anna couldn’t help but laugh out. "No! I am not a prisoner in the cage now, and..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And what?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The time for the appointment was too short." She hammered On the shoulder of Roland, he then extended his right hand with white gauze. "Thank you. Roland. Take me on."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland firmly held her palm, "obey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door, the two slowly passed through the corridor, went down the stairs, and entered the first floor hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall that was still full of people was quiet, and everyone split into two columns, bowing slightly and welcoming Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the lineup - the left is the witches without the winter city, he saw Tilly, Ashes, Nightingale, Wendy, Lightning, Love Gesha... A familiar face is reflected in the eyes. Compared with the escapers who had nowhere to stand three years ago, they have now re-integrated into the new social order and are becoming an inseparable part of the human kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the right are city hall officials and local representatives, such as Barov, Itis, Axe, Carl, Kay, Tassa, Joel, etc. ... Together they formed the authority of the Grey Fort Kingdom, from an ordinary person who was not known to a rising political star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of practice, ascending the throne will be an extremely cumbersome process, but for witches and no Wintertown officials, Roland’s king position is already a given fact, so This process has been greatly simplified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took Anna’s hand and walked to the center of the hall – there was a stone table with two golden crowns erected on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether neither Wimbledon III nor the Hermes Church ceased to exist, he declined the request for a ceremonial request from the ceremonial officer, but decided to interact with Anna. Wear a crown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enthronment and the closure of the same time, in the gray castle is unprecedented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremonial officer naturally expressed dissent, but he was not binding on him who was in power, and Barov also unexpectedly stood on his side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland bent down and asked Anna to wear a crown for herself, then gently placed another crown on her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the two turned around, everyone slid down on one knee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
