			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha looked a little excited and walked around the mahogany table. "So, according to your statement, the divine signature can penetrate the stone of the gods, is Because its magic strength is higher, and the Chaos Beast transforms the stone, essentially reducing its magic intensity and becoming a specific magic stone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I think so."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, no..." She suddenly stopped. "If there is no light, the magic is too high." So why doesn't the witch have this situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Witch?" Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna!" said Ai Gesha, "The magic in her body can activate two divine signatures. It is reasonable to say that strength is better than God's punishment." The stone is still high, but the black fire can't penetrate the interference of the god stone, and there is no banned magic field around her. This doesn't make sense..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"å‘ƒ... ..." He was dumb at the moment, this question can not be explained, even if the quality of the fine stone of punishment, can easily interrupt the ability of the witch to take effect, as strong as Anna's black fire is no exception. And in the foggy world, Anna's magic is like a cube of metal condensation, shaped like a substance, and how it looks is far from the black hole of nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a question, why does the magic stone need to be filled with magic to take effect?" Aegusa continued, "even if they are reduced in magic strength, they should There is a lot of magic to be right, but in fact mortals can't operate them at all, and the magic stone can't be used as a magic source by the witch's special transfer ability. This Quest has already been verified." She paused, "the instructor thinks only Life can hold the magic, the material that loses life will be abandoned by the magic. The blood of the witch and the devil is proof. Most researchers agree with this view. Although I don't mind overthrowing this conclusion, the magic stone does not inject magic or form a character. Before printing, there is not much difference with an ordinary gem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is silent, it seems that the assumption of magic strength is not appropriate, but like black light The magical thunder is too similar to the god stone. There should be some kind of connection in it... What else have you ignored? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, there is no reliable means of observation and analysis in this era. The perceptual record of magic must be done by the ability of the witch or the balance of the magic stone. The magical feature is only the most general expression, and it is difficult to do further research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a long time without results, he had to put this aside in advance, hoping to find the answer in the subsequent print production. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the "melting point" action completed a series of preparatory work, Roland was The dock area personally sent off for the attackers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first large-scale mixed military operation with the witch as the protagonist. The ship has a total of two ships, all of which are equipped with the most elite veterans of the First Army. The captain was Brian - they went to the wall with Roland, confronted the evil beast, and had a high respect and trust for the lord. When they are screened, they will be faced with an extremely fierce alienation, which is even more powerful than a mixed kind of evil beast. If you don't want to participate in the task, you can say it. No one has retreated, and the answer has passed the nightingale review. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, letting this hundred people meet the enemy is still a last resort choice. Their will is reliable, but Roland never dares to overestimate the people of this era. The gods are feared from the bottom of their hearts. He has experienced the bombing of all kinds of film and television works, and it will not be rare to see the terrible monsters. However, for these ordinary people, I am afraid it is an indelible nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the thousands of selected soldiers will be armed at the riverside two or three kilometers away from the action site, and are not directly involved in hunting, unless there is an accident, When the witch must retreat, they will serve as a blocking task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the members of the Witches are Anna, Nightingale, Wendy, Leaves, Aisha, Sylvie, Effie, Lightning and McMug, can be called It is the most powerful lineup of no winter city. According to Ai Gesha, even if the Lord of Hell came, he would not be able to escape and live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protect yourself, safety is the most important," Roland solemnly said. "It doesn't matter if the task is not completed, I will wait for you to come back at the castle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
