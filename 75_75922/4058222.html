			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day Roland got up very late by convention. When I woke up, Anna around me disappeared, leaving only a few flaxes falling from the arms. Fine hair, and a reassuring fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A breakfast was placed next to the bedside table, apparently she brought it from the kitchen, and there was a note on the plate with a short line Handwriting: "Know that you like to sleep late, I will not accompany you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time you can not forget the work, get up on time... can only say her It is indeed a serious person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland shook his head helplessly, turning over and getting out of bed, even if the castle was full of heating, it was a difficult process to leave the comfortable bed in the winter. Anna’s washed tub still exudes a sigh of heat. He simply washed the face with the warm water left in the basin, then took the breakfast and walked gently to the third floor office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the office door, Barov and Itis have been waiting for him inside. The nightingale stayed in the old place, the exclusive lounge chair by the fireplace, while watching the witch comic strip, chewing on the dried fish, the expression of the sly look is always the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So early today?" Roland pretending to say nothing, "What's the matter to sit down and talk about."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough," the town hall general manager cleared his throat and seemed to have been accustomed to it for a long time. "Your Majesty, the logistical preparations for the attack on the extreme south have been completed, and the recruitment of the reserve soldiers is also completed. It is very smooth. By the next spring, the total number of the first army is expected to reach 7,000. This is an unrivaled strength in the Grey Fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just in the Grey Fort," said Itis coldly. "It’s not the stupid knights and nobles that you have to deal with."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland laughed Laugh, open the report on the table, "It is true. If you want to fight against the devil, population expansion and army building cannot stop. Without affecting production, the number of soldiers recruited by the First Army is as good as possible." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although slightly dissatisfied, but the king has already spoken, Rove had to be a cry that while North stared pearl look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to common sense, the recruitment of soldiers and the preparation of logistics should be done by the First Army itself, whether it is an iron axe or a few generals under his command, most of them are born. Low and low, the rate of military operations may be okay, and financial and administrative management will be ignorant. Therefore, the issue of money and food is still to be completed by Barov. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the size of the First Army is further expanded, such staffing will obviously be somewhat difficult to continue. The simple management framework established by the original head can no longer meet the future. The development may be the time to make a new round of reforms to the military system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland regained his attention to the report. According to the plan made by the Iron Axe, the number of soldiers attacking the extreme south is about one thousand people - no winter city is dispatched five The hundred soldiers, together with the five hundred recruits stationed in the Longling Ridge, then marched along the Yinchuan Oasis to Tiesha City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you carry two 152mm fortress guns, there should be no major problems with such a force to attack Tiesha City. However, the key to conquering the Shamin is not to attack the city, but to sacred duel, so the first role of the First Army is to escort and maintain order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thousand people’s logistics work is very handy for the City Hall, and the details involved are getting more and more complete. In the past, one thing was needed. The situation is gone forever, and even some details are beyond the scope of his expectations, apparently the experience accumulated after several actual combat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good, just do it," Roland closed the report and looked at the North Pearl. "Do you have anything to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just a matter of reporting logistics, Isis should not come with Barov. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has never been the kind of person who likes to grab a job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty," Itis nodded. "I listened to the Iron Axe, are you going to hold an artillery drill?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, that's right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
