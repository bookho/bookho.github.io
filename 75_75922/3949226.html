			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the final battle in the expectation did not happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person walked over to the woman warrior and pressed her hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All retreat." His voice was not high, but it was clear and powerful. Eleania noticed that the other party was still in the orderly team. One member, his armband is wearing a headband emblem, "God is coming to the army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head, not far from the team The tall warriors sneaked out from the north gate. They wore a clear body armor, reflecting the silvery luster under the infiltration of rain, with a red-red cloak behind them, and the weapons in their hands were different. Some hold shield swords, and some hold shackles or iron axes. After crossing the suspension bridge, they did not re-set the team, but dispersed, and greeted the flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this tactic, it’s awesome! Faced with a mixture of power and speed far beyond human beings, only by maintaining a formation and gathering the strength of all to win, can they now want to fight alone? Moreover, let the gods punished the army alone, do you stand by and watch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have to support them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," the man shook his head. His face is a bit gloomy. "We just look at it. If we go up, it will only drag them down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break? Eleania stared at each other angrily. Could it be that he was wrong? This person is just a greedy and fearful person? She clenched her hilt and prepared to bypass him to join the battle. Although she was confused about the future of the new holy city, at the moment she faced the enemy, all she could do was to fight the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without two steps, the warrior saw an unbelievable scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flying alien swoops down from the sky, its shape is as terrifying as hell, with huge wings covered with gray feathers, up to twelve when fully open ruler. The head is like a bird, but with a pair of horns, and the barbs on the two claws are enough to cut into the samurai's breastplate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vertical fall from the sky is their usual way of attack, hidden and extremely difficult to defend. Even if it is a double-handed heavy shield, it will be washed down. The huge impact force will cause the shielded arm to smash the bones and the chest cavity to be crushed. It is almost a deadly situation. The only way to cope is to roll outward when the alien is about to fall to the ground, so that it is possible to escape this sinister blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the gods did not dodge, a silver armor placed in front of the enemy, and stretched out his hands at the moment when the aliens rushed to him. The hard top of the palm is on the claw pad of the other side, and the impact force is large, and it sounds like a violent sound like a snowman. A cloud of water rises from him and the monster, and the armor makes a squeaky twist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His right foot is bent, his left foot is straight, his body is stretched into a straight line pointing to the sky, and the alien can't crush him for a while. Another warrior aimed at this deadly flying heterogeneous throwing short javelin, the speed of which made Allexia only see a silver flash, the javelin accurately penetrated the monster's head and shattered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver warrior threw the corpse still twitching on the ground, his arm was not bent properly, obviously the attack was not unscathed, the arm The bones have been broken. But if he had nothing to do, he pulled out the axe at his waist and killed it to other evil beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With humans alone against this group of monsters, Eleania can’t believe her eyes, hundreds of gods and martial artsmen rush into the swarm of evil In the herd, the red cloak is like a torrent of blood, which hardly blocks the enemy's progress. She now understands what the head of the team said is “tossing.” These warriors have the ability to be an enemy. The strength, agility, and reaction speed of each of them is comparable to that of a mixed kind of evil beast—no, or even more. Strong. Ordinary evil beasts have almost no power to fight back in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s amazing!" Eleania felt a heartfelt joy, with this group of heroic and powerful warriors, Hermes Cathedral It is impossible to fall. "Oh, yes, I haven't asked your name yet. My name is Eleania Quinn. I am trying to judge the army. You seem to have known the fighting power of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party looked at her, his eyes were as cold as the ice, he did not report the name, only Shen Sheng said: "My brother is a god fine."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
