			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, one, two, three..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Celebrate your injury, Cheers!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small celebration is going on in the dorm room. Looking at Xia Fa’s happy smile from the heart, Poshan lifted the glass with helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a partner who works together, the other party will come to see her almost whenever she has time, totally ignoring her current situation. In exchange for the previous sleep on the island, she asked herself that she would never be so worried about a non-combat witch. This kind of embarrassing emotion is intertwined with her emotions, which makes her feel as if she owes a lot to Xia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Boshan knew that Xia would not have thought of this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when her eyes moved to another person, her face was not so good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are you here too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cham sighs and drinks "Well, this wine is what I brought, why can't I come?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that without you, we can't drink alcohol." Poshan rolled her eyes. "There are so many pubs in the winter city. Where can I buy them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, His Majesty has declared that the West has entered an emergency war. The drinks are now tube products. If you don't have permission, you can't buy them." Cham shrugged. "So thank you, this is what I sneaked out from the old man."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War?...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bossan suddenly had no interest in bickering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they are lying in bed these days, she can feel the tension of the winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there are more and more news about the pioneering land in the weekly newspaper. Now it has become a two-week issue in the week, including front-line reports and emergency recruitment. And a tracing list. Judging from the contents of the newspaper, although the garrison troops gradually stabilized their positions and pushed the war to the outside of the pioneering land, the price paid was not small. Several grassland farms and settlements that were finally built were destroyed. Those missing workers are undoubtedly fierce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most intuitive response to this is that the eggs and meat in each meal are reduced and the bread is re-established as the main food. Of course, this is still many times better than other cities in the past when you were in exile. At least it is no problem to fill your stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the scene on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can see a large number of recruits wearing military uniforms lining through the central street every day, and on both sides of the road are the residents and relatives. The tension and excitement on the soldier's face is in stark contrast to the situation of the gods who are worried and worried. In terms of the number of people, the number of troops transferred to the fertile plains is by no means a decimal. This scale is completely different from the previous Knights and the church trials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the survival and continuation of the race, thousands of people have invested in it, and behind them are ten times and hundreds of times provide support. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battles that she experienced as a fighting witch are indeed somewhat insignificant...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Before choosing to go to the fertile plains with Xia, I was unwilling to be hit by too many acquaintances. Now that the pioneering land has been destroyed, she has to return to the state of "useless people." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, why didn’t you suddenly talk?” Seeing that Poshan didn’t sneer back, Chalm couldn’t help but have some accidents. He touched the back of his head and sneaked out. Xia, "What did I say wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Xia did not know," Xia spit out his tongue, "but Xia knows that the person who said the wrong thing wants Drink three more cups!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey... are you drunk...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh..." At this moment, the knocking on the door suddenly interrupted the thoughts of Poshan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come on!" Xia Lianqi opened the door with a jump, "Hey...Carmela?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one behind the door is the sleeping island housekeeper Camilla Darry, who swept the room and then walked towards the other two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you have exceeded the visit time." Poshan reluctantly laughed. "Mrs. Dai Rui is deeply hated by people who are not punctual. It’s hard to guess again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come... I obviously remember the time, it’s only half an hour..." Cham whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Poshan was ready to say something, Camilla crossed Chamm and stood in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Witch Alliance has just released a new recruitment order for all witches in the Grey Fort." The big housekeeper opened the door to the mountain. "The current tentative number is five." About ten, there is combat experience is preferred. I think you may be more suitable, so I will ask for it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poshan couldn’t help but she spent a good time Half a mile to understand the meaning of the other party's words - concentrated recruitment, and the combat experience is preferred, is this job related to war? But if this is the case, why is there no requirement for the ability of the recruiter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You guessed it," Camilla seemed to see her doubts. "The witch will form a special team to support the front line and assist the main force." To deal with more difficult battles. I can't reveal too much about the specific news. You should also be aware that as long as there is a risk on the battlefield, it is entirely up to you to decide whether or not to go. Of course... although not much related to ability, It doesn't mean that you should be selected if you want to be recruited. The final result has to be seen - "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am going." Poshan immediately replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing to hesitate at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, she has been waiting for such a day for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So... come with me." Camilla turned sideways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, are you really going to the front line?" His tone seemed to be a bit worried when passing by Chalm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What, I thought you would cheer loudly," Poshan grinned. "When you are in the sky, no one will bother." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I..." He opened his mouth as if to say something, but looking at the back of Poshan, Chalm did not even speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a day, Posanne arrived at the beginning of the lost forest by train. station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person in charge has also changed from Camilla to a woman she has never seen before. She calls herself Isabella, mainly for the screening of this recruitment. With the instructor. Although it was the first time I saw it, I don’t know why, Poshan always felt that there was a feeling of deja vu. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that surprised her was that the people who responded to the recruitment were more than expected - not just the sleeping spells, even the witches There are also many people in the league. In the short half hour on the road, she met vanilla, Amy, heroes, etc. In addition, she also saw several extremely familiar figures in the crowd, such as Effie, who used to be a bloody meeting. And the sundial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that they also want to prove their worth on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting off the bus, the witches, led by Isabella, walked into a factory-like building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment they stepped into the house, everyone was attracted by a piece of steelwork parked in the middle of the open space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like a "car", and the wheels that are tied underneath are proof. However, unlike any kind of car without winter, it has five wheels on one side, and all of them are made of metal. The bottom is spliced ​​and wrapped by pieces of iron. The shape is very special. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
