			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Name? Where does it come from?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nolan, here is this My brother, Bunos, we are from the frozen town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the inquiries from the checkpoint, Niegen Murray replied casually. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the two have already heard about it before arriving in Shenchi Bay, the reviewers facing the Grey Fort are better to tell the truth, otherwise they will probably arrive in the South. I had a big trouble, but they didn't plan to go to the Grey Fortress from the beginning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you pass through the cage mountain, it is the territory of the morning kingdom. There are large villages and towns where you can hide. With one force, the two are not worried about their future life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, compared to the nobility, disguised as a civilian along the way is less likely to attract attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they have already discussed it, they can usually seek a position as a bodyguard or patrolman in the lord, with a decent identity during the day and belong to them at night. Free time. As long as you are at those remote crossings, you will not be able to find the fugitives who have placed the order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they did in the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? It’s quite far from Shenchi Bay,” the inspector said as he recorded. “Is the news of the devil’s resurgence spreading so fast? There are really few northerners like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigen’s heart was a little surprised, and the other side looked at it from the look and the attire. Ordinary people, and the vast majority of ordinary people he has ever seen are only aware of the place where they are staying. Seeing the literary genre is not to be with them. The gray-grey people in front of us can not only know the frozen town, but also tell the distance of this unknown town! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it...? I also listened to a businessman friend. It’s not so long. Will there be more people coming from the winter? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also replied secretly, but the town that was chosen was not far from the wolf. If it is located in the north of Yongdong, I am afraid Caused the other party's suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hope so." The inspector looked to Talos Murray. "Right, your brother's face, can you pick up the headscarf?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He was scratched by a beast, not too convenient to show people..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, but It's a rule, if there are obvious features, I have to write a report."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Niegen frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, it’s just a watchdog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long brother, but the officially sealed knight! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in the wild, he will definitely pull out the guy’s tongue! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, no big deal." Taros Morrie replied coldly, "but just take a look." He picked up his face towel and revealed The twisted cheeks on the lower half were probably too horrifying, and the inspectors couldn't help but step back. The crowds around them were still blowing a cold breath. But even so, the Grey Fortress still completed the record with attachment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So...this is your nameplate," he handed two pieces of metal to Nigan, "as the only voucher for a new identity, remember not to Lost. Now go to the detention area and wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy is afraid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigan took the nameplate and sneered in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The look of the elder brother seems to be dull. In fact, he has already moved his heart. The momentum that this sword is tempered is not something that civilians can bear. Coupled with his current grace, it has turned the deterrent several times, and the other side has not sat down on the ground, it is already outstanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this place is not a big trouble. There are gray castle soldiers armed with guns on the side of the checkpoint. Even if they are superb, they will not be able to escape. Invisible shovel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” Nigan dialed the crowd and took the lead in entering the port terminal. But soon, his footsteps slowed down. "Brother, they are going to take everyone away..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taros also noticed the arrangement of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan to mix the checkpoints and then look for opportunities to act alone sounds good, but the other party has no chance to disperse the refugees. From the entrance ticket to the detention area, the basics are all surrounded by brightly colored cloth strips. The seemingly sparse escapers will be guided into the dock and board the sea boat docked on the shore. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no restrictions on the strips, but the patrolling of the Grey Fortress soldiers - they are kneeling near the street, if the two cross the strips out of the crowd, those guys Never turn a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest gap with the vision is undoubtedly the city itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core area of ​​Shenchi Bay is full of ruins, not to mention the residents, and the well-connected houses are not found, which not only makes them lose their mix. The possibility of the local city people has also made hidden whereabouts a very difficult matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is totally different from Yongdong! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clearly occupied by the devil, but whether it is Xueyingbao or other cities, it is basically intact, but it is not expected to change its appearance in the south. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do?" Nigan couldn't help but reveal a trace of anxiety. Once he boarded the Shanghai ship, he would only be resigned. In case they go directly to the Grey Fort, are there no places to escape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obviously not a way to stay in place. For the fugitives, they all want to leave the devil’s territory as soon as possible. If they are not moving, they will also be patrolled. Stare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are too anxious, you have never been able to get the title of your majesty." Taros Mori spit out the gas, "Go slowly, don't stop." The dock area is so big that the Grey Fortress can't be seamless. If you look at the number of them, you know that there are at most 100 people. As long as you look carefully, we will definitely have the opportunity to get out."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing that his brother said so, Niegen is gradually calming down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how crazy the long brother is when he kills, he is as calm and calm as he is before enjoying the victory. Just follow his instructions and there is no step. But go for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, Niegen Murray found the opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Brother, look at it!" he exclaimed in a low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...unbelievable." Talos observed after a while and nodded his approval. "It must be said that the Grey Fortress is indeed unusual in the sinister way. Carrying a carriage can do the same."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the corner of the pier, there are more than ten four-wheeled vehicles, their size is extremely amazing, the cargo is carried Nor is it a common carriage. The food and other supplies needed by the evacuees seem to be provided by them. At least between the terminal and the four-wheeler, there are many porters who shuttle between them and transport the bags of goods to Shanghai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people there is more messy and overlaps with the detention area. It is not too difficult to get close to the vehicle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even if you arrive at the car, it will not be able to escape the control of the Grey Fortress - unless they can run through the firearms, they will be reacted sooner or later. The patrol team caught up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only viable option is to hijack a car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These four-wheelers are huge, but they still need people to drive, and unlike the carriages, the driver seems to be wrapped in the front. In other words, they have the opportunity to hijack the driver while ensuring that they are not found. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigan and Taros looked at each other and instantly confirmed the thoughts in each other's hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the cover formed by the huge car body, finding the vehicle to leave, and then aligning the dagger to the driver's throat, the next thing is the water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
