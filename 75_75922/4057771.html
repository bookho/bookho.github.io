			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling what happened in the morning, Roland felt a little unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You say that he is a normal traverser, how can he become the chosen winner? At this time, should I read two poems to express my own horror? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wake up early in the morning, when Ai Gesha reported his observations to him, he thought he had got it wrong. But with the proof of many witches, he can only recognize this first. At the same time, Roland knows that this result will definitely be beyond the expectations of the reciters of Takira. In order to strengthen the integrity of the communication, he simply let the other party visit his nap at noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if the psychological quality is becoming more and more popular after becoming a king, or simply lazy... Pick up a book of "Advanced Mathematics" lying on the office bench It didn't take long to look through it, but I actually slept. When I was awake, the first sight I saw was the back of the nightingale, and the appearance of Feilis fainting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland does not think that the so-called "celebrity" is the election of the day, it is only the remnants of Takira who have placed too much on what they found. Hope, so that the witch who can activate it becomes a savior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the three seats of the Federation can be turned into enemies when they are extremely distressed. The things in the ruins must be different, but they have the power to praise the gods. It is worth considering the devil in one fell swoop. After all, it is like a god-creator. How can people who make it disappear into the labyrinth of the earth without any sound? . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if you want to know the inside story, you have to communicate further with the survivors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of another dream can be observed, and on the other hand, his conjecture is proved - this dream world is not completely constructed by his consciousness. Too rich details go far beyond the brain's ability. He provides a lot of material, but they are combined to form others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he speculated that the witch is the terminal of the magic transformation, it seems that there is still a level between the terminal and the magic. It is this level that gives a magical change. It is like a black box with unknown principles. The witch can give back the result as long as the witch gives instructions. In other words, the witch's ability to achieve the process is the same as the dream world. The only difference is that he has no magic to bring out the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Roland think of the relationship between the Master and the Magic Net. The former connects to the Magic Net through gestures, spells and spellcasting materials, and asks for the power they need. If you think of the level as a magic net, there are some similarities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after he defeated Jiro, he unexpectedly gained the ability to connect to the level, but that's all. The complexity of the instructions is related to the difficulty of the present, and is not the same as the strength and use of the ability. On the contrary, the closer the ability is to the essence of magic, the easier it is to convert—for example, to convert magic directly into light and heat, which is certainly much easier than creating matter, but the power is absolutely earth-shattering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also a major reason why Roland is interested in the ruins. The light column presented by the colorful magic stone is like a special "instruction to send". means. Use artificial things to replace witches, try to forge orders... The study of magic can go deep into this point, obviously beyond the level of the federation, aside from the title of full-fledged, such as the heavenly selector and the sacred instrument, it may It means the germination of new technologies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light is this, he must deal with the Takira witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that "the winner is actually a mortal" may have a heavy blow to the other party, and even frustrate their confidence in fighting the devil, Roland Decided to let Felice visit the power of the new era before going deep into the negotiations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve a better "convincing" effect, he called the iron axe into the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is the recent outbreak of the evil beast?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Scattered disturbances, the patrol team on the wall can solve." Shamin replied after a standard military ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very well, I plan to hold an artillery drill in the city wall area recently. It needs a huge scene and minimize waste." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
