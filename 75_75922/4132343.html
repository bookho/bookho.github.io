			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Itis adults..." Fei whispered, "That is the loss of more than two hundred people, what is the victory..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two hundred people - just," Northland Pearl interrupted the other party's words, "Devil? About 50 or so in the camp, including one High-level devils, the casualties of the First Army are almost entirely caused by them. At first glance, 50 to two hundred, we have suffered a big loss, but the enemy who died before the line of defense is less than two thousand - this is still It is only the most preliminary estimate that those devils who have been blown up into pieces during the escape process have to spend several days to spell out a complete number. I am not wrong, Miss Sylvie?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Sylvie hesitated. "The enemy's body seen by the Eye of Magic is almost like this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Mrs. Ai Gesha, I guess you did not command a war more than four hundred years ago, and you have not even participated in a big fight yourself, right?" Look to the ice witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter can't help but frown. "In the battle of God, fighting with the devil is a compulsory course for the Witch of the Federation. I used to be a researcher at the Quest." I also played with the enemy on the way to explore the ruins..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am talking about war." Idish leaned forward and looked aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Itis -" Iron Axe stopped the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Anna asked suddenly, her intervention also pulled the attention of everyone back. "Why do you think so? As far as I know You are the head of the Knights in the North, and have not experienced the big battle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is asked by someone else, it is like pouring on fire Oil, but from the mouth of Anna, everyone is surprised by the peace, there is no dispute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the pure and serious eyes that make people feel no other thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis also converges and returns to the chest. "You are right, I have not experienced a real war, but some people have experienced it." ......" She gave a slight meal. "Look at her look and know what the result is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people looked at the eyes of the North Pearl, and saw the corner of the long table, the representative of the Takila side, Felice is holding a cup of hot tea, she The mouth is rising and the eyes are full of smiles. Every once in a while, I will pick up a cup and sip a bite, like a delicious drink. For the Taqila witches, this is not a common sight - they lose their taste and they only eat for the sake of survival, and it is almost impossible to reveal the expression of enjoyment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, everyone noticed that the discussion was so intense, and that Felice’s attention was not at all at the meeting – even if it’s now The focus, she is still in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Wendy gently pushed her, Felice returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Where did you talk about it?" The godly witch coughed twice. "I just thought about a very important thing, I didn't pay attention to you for a while." What to say. Why, is there a question for the Queen's Highness who wants to ask me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The scene was dumb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obviously in a daze, but it’s a big thing to think about in front of everyone’s face. The original ancient witch of 400 years ago is in some ways and now. People are not much different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噗."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know who laughed first, and all of them were panned There was a chuckle, and the heavy atmosphere in the room suddenly dissipated a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that I don't need to ask again." Anna shook her head with a funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis stood up and looked around. "The devil is bigger, the devil is turning, and we are still standing here, Tower One The site is also safe and sound. Where did the failure come from? My Majesty once said to me that measuring the outcome often depends on whether or not the goal has been achieved. Obviously, they have not achieved the desired result. Even I can say The devil's commander made a very serious mistake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
