			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the basket was grounded, a witch who looked like a 30-year-old, with a red to the waist, stepped out of the basket and greeted me. "Hello." Welcome to Bianbu Town, I am Wendy.” Then she looked at the ashes and showed a happy smile. “You are here too.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is before The witch mentioned by Ashes? Sylvie looked at the two thoughtfully, and it seems that they have known it very early. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome, I am Anna." Another witch's appearance made Hilvey shine, and the blue waters of the lake were pure. People are eye-catching. But what makes her even more concerned is the magic of the other side - huge, honest, and almost flawless. A block of black and white and gray is slowly rotating, and the magic that has gathered around it is distorted by it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What an amazing power? For the first time, Sylvie saw the magic of such oppression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, my name is lightning!" It was this little girl who flew next to the hanging basket, and McMug also followed her on her shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕咕!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ashes will briefly introduce the witches on the island, Wendy smiled and invited everyone to board the gondola. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The huge balloon in the head is called a hot air balloon. As long as it can provide hot air, it can take everyone to the mountains and reach the destination. She paused a little and asked in the ashes. "Don't you go to the town to see it? I think that my Highness must also see you again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" He wouldn't welcome someone who was going to dig his witch. "The ash smiled. "These children are bothering you to take care of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why? ..." Wendy looked awkwardly and licked her lips. "Reassure, I will treat them well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So everyone is hurrying," Anna reminded Tao, "Yangwang is about to take off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi only felt a slight shock at the foot, the basket had left the ground, she poked her head and saw Ashes and Molly are waving to them. As the hot air balloons continue to rise, the scenery on the ground shrinks smaller and smaller, and the two quickly become spots of nail size - no How, new life will start soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter’s ability seems to be controlling the wind, and the hot air balloon moves under her control to the 6th direction of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilvi is still the first time to look at the earth from the air, although the earth and the mountains can not stop her exploration, but one-time income from such a wide range of fields The fundus is still a novel experience. She tried to summon the eye of magic, and did not expect that the chaotic scene flooded into the mind—hidden rock walls hidden deep in the sea, underground rivers connected to the sea, animal bones buried in the mud, and underground rock layers. Change... These pictures suddenly make Sylvia feel a splitting headache, and the magic of the body drops sharply. She quickly interrupted the eye of the magic and gasped while sitting in the hanging basket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you alright?" someone asked. She opened her eyes and now the other is Wendy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, just a little... dizzy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s better to take a few deep breaths Wendy smiled. "Many people feel uncomfortable when they are away from the earth for the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, I am better," Hillway head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere along the way is much more harmonious than she had originally expected, as the ashes said, Wendy is full of concern for anyone, not because They are newcomers and treated differently. Although there are not many Anna words, as long as someone asks her questions, she will still answer them seriously. Lightning seems to be very good with Mai Hao, and his personality is very lively. From time to time, he flies into the basket with the fat pigeons and chats with everyone. He does not regard himself as a stranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With McMug as the bond between the two sides, the other four people gradually relaxed and asked the lightning to inquire about the situation in Bianbu Town. Later, the little girl simply hovered over the hanging basket and told everyone about the story of the town against evil beasts and invaders, as well as the incredible princes of His Royal Highness, and smashed everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
