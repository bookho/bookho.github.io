			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just two days after the order was issued, before the storm completely swept the human continent, Lightning and McMug returned to the Winter City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the two entered the office, Roland could not help but swear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change of wheat is not big, but the body shape is stronger than half a year ago. It is not like a white pigeon when it is on the top of the partner. A goose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hair grows a lot, hanging from the ear to the shoulder, probably because of the long-term investigation task, almost no time to take care of it, it seems Some messy. The face is also dirty, the flight suit has several patches, and there are a few ugly and ugly bags on the side of the legs, chest and arms, like sewing them. Although it looks much more cumbersome than the original, beautiful and original coat, it is more like an explorer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the biggest change is the eyes and her look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if she had been separated from the image in memory by night, it was no longer the little girl of the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, are you looking for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After lightning strikes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland suppressed the feelings in his heart and told the information he had read and Isis’s speculation. "If the devil really has this plan, the consequences are unimaginable." So I hope that both of you can go to the winter and investigate the mountains in the north where no one has ever been involved. The devil can't do without the supply of red fog. If they want to enter the mountains, they will surely leave traces. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There would be such a thing..." Lightning could not help but frown. "Fortunately, Mai Mai found the letter. But kneel, in case the enemy walks." What should I do underground? My ability is limited, and it is difficult to find deliberately hidden targets in the air."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the worst situation." As a result of the torch action, the devil's ability to dig is far less than that of a human who devours worms. But stretching the perspective to the overall situation, encroaching on half of the light, and studying the magic more deeply, the possibility of not finding a remnant of underground civilization is not great, since the federation can get the worm carrier by exploring the remains, the enemy also This is inevitable. No trace of the carrier was found in the decisive battle of Tacila, and it did not mean that it was not in the continental spine. "The gods will take a magical core to start from the Port of Shoal. If you don't find the enemy, then it is the last resort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" So, I will do my best." Lightning nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But it takes at least a month from the southern end of the Grey Fort to the north of Yongdong. During this period, you may not be able to get support and supplies in time. Residents there may still be prejudiced against witches, and even if they are in the city, they are not necessarily safe. You must be careful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wilderness is the explorer's "Look at the skills, "Your Majesty," she said without hesitation. "Don’t say a month, it’s no problem for a year and a half."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" Mai Hao opened his wings and agreed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry," Roland sighed. "You just came back, I let you go further afield..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, you are serious..." Lightning turned to the beginning, and the voice became a bit low. "It’s nothing compared to those who sacrificed to fight against the devil. "But she only regained her spirit." Since this is another new expedition, then by convention, can you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland Pico A glimpse, then reacted, "Of course." He stood up and walked out from his desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning raised his hand and saw the stain on his sleeve and then suddenly shrank back. "Oh, no, no... I forgot first Changed the clothes, the smell of the body is also strange, or counted -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, before she finished, Roland had already reached out and hugged her hands. she was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
