			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the completion of the grace, he helped the pope return to the cart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jie Luo," Oberlin gasped and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pure man in white came out of the small door on one side, and almost no sound was heard in the footsteps. "I am here."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop frowned. He did not expect that there would be a pure presence in such a secret place. Although they were awakened, they were all brought up by the Pope and served for the rest of their lives, but... ... These women are witches after all. And the other party seems to know the existence of the reflection church earlier than himself, which makes him feel a little unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take him to the illusion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well." She went to the prayer table. Hold down the stone carving ceremony placed on the table, the magic shines brightly, and the giant painting behind it rises slowly, revealing a black metal door. Then Jie Luo took off the pendant from the neck of the pope, inserted the spar pendant into the door lock, and the inside of the iron door came out with a click and opened inward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After she took out the pendant, she did not return it to Oberlin, but handed it to Mayn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop looked back at the Pope, who nodded. "Hold it, you will keep it in the future. Whether it is the collection of the Pontifical Temple." The room, or the secret door of the research institution, can be opened with this spar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's go," Jie Liao smiled and took up Mayn The hand, walked into the room behind the giant painting - this should be where the ground church does not exist, in the same position, there is only one floor-to-ceiling window facing the Hermes Plateau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room looks very spacious and has a circular structure, almost half the size of a prayer hall, and can accommodate dozens of people standing side by side, it is difficult to follow it. The Chamber of Secrets is linked together. But there is nothing in the big space, it looks empty, the only place where you can sit down is a stone bench that extends along the curved wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the metal door was closed, Mayn opened the hand of the pure man. "Do you want to come in with your armpit?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jie Luo does not think that, "If I don't come in, who will start the illusion magic stone? You can't drive the magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Such a rude answer makes Mayn feel a glimpse. It seems that she is still living in the witches of Oberlin, and when she takes over the scepter and takes charge of the church, she must let her know, not just the pope. I, the archbishop with the qualification to inherit, is also the object of respect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So let's get started," he resisted the surging emotions and sat down on the stone bench. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, adults," Jieluo opened a dark board on the wall and put his hand on the stone. "But please be prepared, because I am also Start this thing for the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First time? Didn't she live for more than two hundred years, did she not participate in the previous handover ceremony? Mayn felt a little strange in his heart, but he couldn't think too late, and a dazzling light flashed. He was surprised to find that he was in darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of black is so pure, there is no light source at all, the walls, floors and stone benches seem to disappear, he is swallowed by a deep abyss Into, suddenly lost the concept of far and near, the sky and the underground are all integrated, the focus of the place is all black. Bowing his head, even his body is not in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean held his breath and carefully reached down and touched it. The stone bench was still under his body, lame, and the floor was the same. He relaxed a little. It seems that he was not transferred to a new basement, but the ability of the magic stone swallowed up all the light here. ,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in such a dark situation, how can you see the "truth" in your mouth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if answering his doubts, the ground is lit up again, but it is obvious that this is not a scene in the secret room, every stone is polished smooth. Bright, engraved with a complex and exquisite pattern, and reflects the blue luster. Soon the top of the head shone, and he was surprised to see a transparent skylight on the top plate, through which he could even see the clear sky and clouds outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
