			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the words came out, the people present were stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three sisters, no... what are you talking about?" Rohan first came back from the shock, "Leave here? What about the clan?" What about the sacred duel? Where are you going?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luojia didn't answer, just looking at his father quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulz could not help but smile, he vomited and swayed at the other people. "Go out, let me talk to her alone." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father..." Luo Khan opened his mouth and seemed to want to say something, but he eventually swallowed back in the second half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards were equally astonished, but after all, Luo Jia was the daughter of the patriarch, who faithfully executed the order with a puzzled look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, there are only two fathers and daughters in the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want to go to the North?" Gould asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Luo Jia did not hide his thoughts. "I will go to the south of the gray fort, find the ashes, and then follow her to the winter city." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about the mad flame clan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going to the South to settle down, there is an oasis There is no need to fight each other for water and food.” She paused for a moment. “In fact, you have already planned this way...so you have not accepted the challenge of the Angry Tao clan.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulz picked up his eyebrows and left no doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luo Jia went on to say, "The strong opponent is not the reason for your concession. Before I was awakened to be a goddess, the flames already occupied the head of the clan. The position is decades. Even if the anger of the black water is really strong, even better than the mad flame, you will definitely let the other party pay the price of unforgettable - we have been relying on such momentum, the biggest stone in Tiesha City "There is a heel in the fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore, you have not accepted the only reason for the duel, but the sacred duel for the prelude to the Iron Sands City has no meaning. Fighting for the clan's way forward, but if it is because of a meaningless battle, let the young and brave warriors bleed to death, you are not willing to do this... I am right, father?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulz licked her face for a while, then couldn’t help but curl up her mouth and shook her head again and again. “I really don’t know if you are born smart or like a wolf. Keen, maybe both? In fact, I Just dragging the move, just want to wait for you to wake up and ask your opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't understand this, but also tell you the intelligence And keenly missed... I just believe in my fist," Luo Jia shook his long ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, as long as I played with me, I can Feel what kind of person the opponent is. When you were young, but you taught me how to fight, I have been through the fists and swords, and naturally can guess your plans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really a gratifying statement," Gulze laughed. "What about the ashes? Can we believe her?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" She is like a mountain, high in despair...but the mountain has always been silent and not lying. And from her, I feel the guardianship," Luo Jia said slowly, "the person who can be guarded by her." I will feel very warm and calm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Listen to you, I am more at ease," Gould seems to have made up his mind, "since Going to the South, why don't you wait a few more days and join us on the road?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't want to wait for a moment, father...just On the north side, I can feel my heartbeat," Luo Jia said, pressing the chest. "It is urging me to start as soon as possible. In addition, if you take a step closer than the clan, you can see if they are really like propaganda. Sand people can enjoy an oasis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
