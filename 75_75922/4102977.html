			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is a First Army soldier in the church, he does not have the origin of the war of the gods, but simply tells the history of the witch empire into a church. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but only these messages are enough to make the high priests feel uncomfortable - whenever you mention the internal secrets of the church, Jacob’s eyes It will be a big point, and in the end it will become almost like a lantern. He seems to want to refute, but when he comes to his mouth, there is only a voice that is swaying. Obviously, some information is beyond his understanding, but they are consistent with the various rumors in the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the old priest’s anger, Roland stopped for a moment—he was not because he had nothing to say, but worried about it again. If you talk about it, the other party will be discouraged directly. Although there is nothing wrong with it, he is still not addicted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until Jacob returned, he continued, "It seems that your understanding of the nature of the church is no different, otherwise it should not be so shocking." I’m eclipsed, I want to blame me for nonsense, but I find that there are unquestionable clues before and after. I think everything about the battle between the devil and the gods is passed down from generation to generation by the Pope, in order to make this goal... or Saying that faith is not forgotten. However, the powers are naturally afraid of the witch, not to mention the wishes of the early pope, even the four hundred years of the past are not dare to mention. It is said that it is going to fight for humanity, but the whole Hull In the holy city of Metz, how many other believers know this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the gray castle is different... there is no winter city in the west, this kind of news is not What is the secret, each of my ministers knows the existence of the devil, and the plan against the war of gods is also written into the policy outline - from the farmer to the blacksmith, all the people are fighting for it, this is me and you The biggest difference! It can be said that a few years ago, I In preparation for resisting the end of mankind." Roland looked at the other side's iron-blue face with interest. "The church is the only savior of mankind? You are too high to look at yourself. First, whether I can beat this. A powerful enemy, at least one thing is certain -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to the old priest and said word by word, "The church can't even win, Where can the confidence come to save all mankind? Don't be delusional!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We..." Jacob’s expression suddenly froze, and then the blood color faded away. His face turned from green to white, as if there was no such thing as a thousand words. It is obvious that he did not consider such a problem. He just turned a blind eye to his heart and now he was suddenly exposed. The last trace of persistence also declared disintegration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old priest slowly fell to the ground, no longer solemn and proud when he appeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take him back to prison," Roland waved. "It’s useless to send the age to the mine. Let him live well. Wait until the red moon falls. Let him see for himself how the people of the Grey Fortress fought against the devil - hope that at that moment, he still remembers how to repent of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Yes, Your Majesty." The soldier forced Jacob out and took his arm and stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, doing a good job." Roland looked at Isabella, "If it weren't for you, the Holy City would not restore order so quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter opened the line of sight very rarely, slightly sternly. "You... don’t mind at all? I issued orders and integrations in the name of the Pope’s agent. Those who are abandoned."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About fabricating a new history, the church is completely split into two, he has been from Itis, Eagle and Isa Bella’s own report has been known, and Beidi Pearl is highly respected. It is believed that this move not only hopes to bring the old and new holy city into the gray castle, but also absorb the influence accumulated by the church for hundreds of years. force. Even if the fugitives had a separate stove, in the face of Roland, who actually controlled Hermes, even if it was true, he also made a three-pointer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is considered more realistic. This plateau is located in the middle of the desolate mountain range, opposite to the big gap. It is a strategy that must be defended in the battle of gods. Ground. Originally attacking Hermes has the intent to replace it. Now it is a good thing to use the original human resources to save the next part of the expenses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why should I mind if it turns out to be effective?" He smiled. "But even so, the sentence of the service cannot be waived." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
