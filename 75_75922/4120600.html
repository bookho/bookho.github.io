The mortal king probably won't think so..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "The power is not alone, now," Pasha pointed to Zoe. "The key to the change of the human kingdom today is something that cannot be replaced, and that is exactly where our strength lies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out to be the case!" Catherine suddenly realized, "This is indeed much more important than fighting ability."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"Ha..." Zoe helped, "I will be exempted, and this responsibility will be handed over to Farn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heed "What the hell are you talking about?" El said dissatisfied. "Why can't I understand it at all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pasa said it was knowledge, "The youngest extraordinary person pouts. "Is there a college, a library, and a private-sector scholar in the dream world? Since dreams are all from his memory, everyone should be able to learn." Compared with the selective transcript, it is obviously better to absorb the whole. As long as you take part of the entertainment time, starting from the most basic knowledge, and spending more than ten years of effort, you will be able to add a group of helpers who can fully understand his intentions. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mortal's energy will fade away as the body ages, and we don't have to worry about it. A hundred years is enough to make the gods sorcerer become conscious." Successor, this is our greatest advantage," added Pasha. "Especially after he passed away, only we know what the world looks like."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to continue along the road that Roland has developed, you must pass us." So, even if the identity of the witch is abandoned, we will not be affected too much. In the sense that it is not good for us to try to overthrow the will of the underworld, the witch alliance will never sit idly by. In turn, we only control knowledge, it is good for any faction, even if it does not have force, it will become a weightlifter. . Light strength. "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;?" This is not the sky school practice it "El leisure muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to legend, most of the human beings are still in ignorance, and some sages have come together to spread the fire of civilization. They teach people how to burn iron, weaving, and farming, until humans are everywhere. After hundreds of years, their prestige became so full that all those in power did not hesitate to use all means to win over them, and many members changed from a communicator of knowledge to a private possession of power. After seeing this, the leaders of the sages moved the organization out of the major city-states and stipulated that they should not easily get involved in politics, but only focus on the mysteries of the world. And solve the mystery of the ancient ruins. Since the relocation of the station is located in the peak of a mountain, it is covered by clouds all the year round, so the world calls it Yunxiao School. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these people rarely interact with the world, their status is still extraordinary. No matter how the royal power alternates, it is respectful to the Yunxiao School. Every year, it will send a large amount of materials and young disciples, only to get the guidance of the sages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of good times are not long, the devil quickly entered the human vision, the first battle of the gods broke out - that is, at that time, a The uneasiness of rumors gradually spread, and the introduction of these horrible beasts into the glory was a sage of hundreds of years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reputation of the Yunxiao School has also plummeted, and it has been swallowed up by the devil without any lord willing to lend a helping hand, becoming the dusty corner of the history books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least we wonâ€™t be colluding with the devil," said Celine, "and the title of the manager of knowledge is also good, than those that will be determined by the Quest." The title is much better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, this is only a preliminary direction. After all, all plans for the future have to wait for the devil to be meaningful." Pasha smiled and patted the head of the tentacles. "Okay, let's adjust the soul instrument. Wait for the celebration outside, and you should be prepared here. I don't think there will be patience waiting for tomorrow." ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp When the people of the city are still celebrating the victory, Roland has entered the third side of the city with the main members of the united front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
