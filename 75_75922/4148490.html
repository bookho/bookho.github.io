			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the red mist has poured from the desolate mountains, everything in the world seems to have been covered with a layer of tulle. Ma Weien Parker thought that he would be as uncomfortable as in a dusty mine, but the accident was that the body did not feel any discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you breathe hard, you can even feel a trace of dampness and coolness. According to the devil commander, these fogs contain the essence of life, not only will not cause any harm to humans, but also have the benefits of nourishing. Only witches who are specifically opposed to them will be fatally rebelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some credibility in this statement for the time being, but at present, there is no other disadvantage besides slightly affecting the line of sight. After a month, he has been used to life in the red fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Duke of the Lord, the Lord of the Scorpio sent someone to come." At this moment, a guard went into the study, "Now you are in the courtyard." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien nodded quietly, "Please post it later, I will pass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the guards closed the door, Ma Weien could not help but smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Duke. No matter how many times he listens, he can make him happy. When the devil passed through the ice to kill the snow for a month ago, he thought it was the end of the rumor. He didn't expect the other party to let him go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after "abandoning" the inherent prejudice, Ma Weien discovered that the devil who claimed to be the Lord of Scorpio was not imaginatively difficult to communicate, to some extent It is said that it is even better than the gray castle people - at least the former will not be unreasonable to turn the nobility's territory into nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil does not tax, does not grab the land, does not seize power, as long as they swear allegiance, they will be able to save everything, and have the opportunity to get more, except The means was a bit rude, but there was no other disadvantage. In particular, after the Scorpio Lord handed over the three cities around Xueyingbao to him for management, he even thought that this might be good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snow-casting is like an island, easy to defend and difficult to attack, others can hardly threaten his territory, and he is also difficult to open up. I thought that the title of the Earl was estimated to be worn for a lifetime. I did not expect that when the end of the day came, I took a big step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jurisdiction of the entire northern region of the Kingdom of the Winter, he is well-deserved Duke of the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien held the corner of his mouth by hand, and finally let the smile subside. He closed the window and turned and walked downstairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, when the devil entered the city, he did kill dozens of guards and hundreds of people, but how can the war be undead? Isn’t the demarcation line between the aristocrats determined by war? Now that he holds the four cities, the guard team has not only shrunk, but has doubled it. Not to mention the people, as long as there is land for them to live, they will always be able to make up for a few years. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for those who are behind the scenes who are afraid of choosing to surrender to the devil, they should be on the gallows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When entering the courtyard, Ma Weien saw the messenger sent by the Scorpio Lord at first sight, and the huge monsters beside him. To be honest, he can't tell the difference between these guys from the outside. Unlike Heikzod, they are both ugly and rough, and they don't know how to be polite and educate. If he didn't look at the commander of the Magic Army, he didn't want to deal with the beasts at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what is your command of the Lord of Heaven?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party pulls out from the mount A stone was handed to him, then opened his mouth and said in a lame tone, "You. Listen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is it a magical voice... <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the suffocating suffocation in the mouth of the messenger, Ma Weien couldn’t help but lean back and tried to suppress the disgust of the bottom of his heart. "I listen." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone flashed twice, and soon a familiar voice sounded out of nowhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not, sir," Ma Weien replied quickly. "I'm always ready to work for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, I believe that one month has passed Let your people get used to our existence, now is the time - I need you to call a team to help us build the camp, not in the winter, but in the wolf kingdom. The number must be at least two thousand, of course... The more the better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the hard work that needs to work? Ma Weien estimated that it is not difficult to make such a person from four cities. "Bag on me, sir."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did not choose the wrong one. Man." There is more satisfaction in the voice of the Lord of Heavenly Supreme, "In addition, how are the weapons I have handed over to you? Can your people copy it?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." Ma Weien said with a sad face, "It doesn't matter if you use it, but if you want to copy it, I'm afraid it will take some time... I assembled the best blacksmiths in the North, let them be responsible for creating One part, the progress is not ideal. I think this is probably related to the witch. After all, the blacksmith told me that the parts are not like ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think so too." Fortunately, there is no blame in the words of the Scorpio Lord. "But even so, you should be able to use it to counter the Grey Fort. This is my second for you." Order, send people to stop the gray plunder from plundering the souls of the people, I will also hand over other seized weapons to "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't have enough knights under my hands--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Go to the call!” The Lord of Scorpio interrupted, “Do you humans not like to use this set to expand their talents? Seal their own territory and draw those who have the ability to do things for themselves. Don’t be reluctant to offer, this one If things can be done well, it will not be a problem for you to be the king of the winter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ma Weien is trembled...the king of the winter, this once he The name that I dare to touch in my dreams has now come to me in this way? He pressed his abruptly accelerating heartbeat and tried to control his tone back. "Follow, sir, I will do my best to finish it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time, I want to see the results as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't let you down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The light of the stone disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, one week, come again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The messenger climbs directly to the flesh-wing monster With both hands raised, they immediately vacated. The latter made a strange scream, fluttering its wings and flying out of the city, and soon disappeared into the field of vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ma Weien was covered by the dust of flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn! He coughed and wondered if the devils were acting like the head of the sky, and it is estimated that they would not be widely spread into monsters from hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the castle, he immediately called the old bachelor - although the last time the other performance was quite uncomfortable, directly on the top of the wall scared the pants, but He will not have a more reliable planner for a moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After repeating the request of the Lord of Heaven, Ma Weien asked, "What do you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Adult, this is a rare opportunity!" The old bachelor took his hand with excitement. "From the time of your father's generation, I served the Parker family. The desire to be on the lips, now you have not only done the first step, but also have the opportunity to win the winter, you must grasp it anyway!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I I think so, but... Do you think that we can find some knights to win the Grey Fortress?” Ma Weien said the doubts in his heart. “You have seen the subtlety of the snow powder, and there is basically no imitation. Maybe. The number of devils seized must be limited. What should I do if I finish the game?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, adults, we don't need to be hard-hitting with the gray-street army," The old bachelor shook his head. "The Lord of the Scorpio does not have this plan. Its original words are "preventing plunder" - I know, dispersing ash Fort-strong team was very powerful, very long arms, but we can take the initiative with a strategy! If you can successfully break a few looting squads, they will certainly be able to get involved. In fact, when I heard about you, I thought of a wonderful strategy. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
