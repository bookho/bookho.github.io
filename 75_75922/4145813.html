			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that," the nightingale thought for a while, "paste a bridge between two unconnected rivers than to build a complete railway." Hard roads need to save a lot of trouble. And the railway can not be separated from Anna and skilled workers, but ordinary roads can be repaired by anyone, even those who have just arrived can be competent, so that we can save a lot of money. Time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, this is another advantage of it," Roland praised. "As long as it is well planned, it can be relieved in a month or two. The pressure of logistics is of great significance to us who fight every second. It seems that you can think of the key points of the problem occasionally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, of course... ...no," the nocturnal corner of the nightingale quickly pressed down again. "What is occasional! As long as I seriously think about it, I can do it too - whether it is to help you with your official duties or to take the test..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she is righteous, The last part of the voice was a little lower than the first phrase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but chuckle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps for the nightingale, the premise of serious thinking is not to be sleepy first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his gaze back to the map on the table. If you want to connect the gray castle and the morning waterway, the quickest way is to go east of the Chishui River. At the turning point, a road leading to the Yongye City was built, and then all the way to the north, through the morning wind, and the flashing river of the neighboring country. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This river originates from the Hermes Plateau, and the main river channel is divided into three in the old provincial city, two of which are wide and tributary from north to south. The dawn of the country, and finally into the sea. In order to further utilize shipping resources, the Moya family opened three east-west canals in the past 100 years, which is equivalent to adding three crosses to the two herringbone tributaries. This greatly facilitates the commercial circulation of Chenxi in China. Roland offers a shortcut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Flash River to the Mobei River, and then repair a road that leads directly to the Cage Mountain, there will be a “dedicated passage” between the two places separated by a thousand miles. Compared to the extremely expensive railway line, the plan only needs to build two hard roads, adding up to less than two hundred kilometers, and three supporting loading docks. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the destructive power of trucks on the road, if you only rely on the lotus paved road, the workers sprinkle the gravel and compact it, it will take a long time to send people to repair and repair. In case of heavy rain, the disintegration is faster. Therefore, Roland intends to take a step in place, using cement stabilized sand as a hardened layer, and a road without a winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cement is no longer a rare thing for today's Winter City, but it is still a time-consuming and laborious task to transport it to the morning. Instead of wasting capacity, it is better to produce on site. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finishing the drawings, Roland wrote a letter to the agent king of neighboring country, Andrea's father, Horford Quin. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to dispatch a portion of the technicians to Huiguang City to pass the cement calcining formula and steam paddle boat assembly technology to the three major families of Wangdu to build the factory. Repair roads to share the pressure of no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believes that the nobility will be able to see the potential and value of cement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these two technologies, the transportation in the morning can be solved by themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the steam engine itself, it is still provided by the Winter City - it is not that he is reluctant to pass on the core technology, but in addition to no winter, there is no industry in other cities. It is meaningless to use the basics, the technology is empty, and the raw materials still need to be shipped. It is better to send the finished products directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is not worried about the other party’s perineum, or does not work hard. If the red fog really appears in the desolate mountains, Horford should soon hear the news, and by that time, he will naturally know what to do is a wise choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Roland witnessed the first migrants at the top of the Miracle Building arrival. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long fleet barely sees the end, and the black and white columns of smoke seem to form a high wall perpendicular to the river bank. The dense crowd stepped onto the trestle and entered the dock under the guidance of the police. Along the Chishui River, the shoulders were connected, and the colorful heads filled all the open spaces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
