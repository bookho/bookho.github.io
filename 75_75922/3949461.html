			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day after the relocation of the Sleeping Island witch, Roland called the town hall chief Barov to the office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need you to post a recruitment announcement," he pushed the drafting content to the other party. "A short-term job in a week, about ten people, preferably a woman." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barof took the paper and looked at it carefully. "His Royal Highness, may I ask starch...what is it?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know wheat flour?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manager hesitated, "Do you mean coarse or fine powder? Can be baked into bread, or baked into a wheat cake, and you are eating the fine powder that further sieves the bran. The latter produces only 60% of the former, and the baked bread is softer, but the price is very high. Only the great aristocrats can afford it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Finance Minister’s assistant made Roland most satisfied with the full understanding of all kinds of underlying goods. . Because of the backwardness of agriculture and the lack of food, the same thing is completely different in all walks of life. For example, the most common wheat, the common method of eating is to directly smash the husked wheat granules, so that the food can be used to the utmost extent, but some residual husks and sandstones will be cooked together in the pan and often eaten. Tooth decay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little nobility should pay attention to some, they will order people to sift the grain into the sand, grind it into a coarse powder, and bake it into bread and pancakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going up is the rich aristocratic class at home. Food is no longer a tool for these people to simply fill their stomachs, but to pursue delicious enjoyment. means. The kitchen will further sift the wheat flour, remove the bran, and get the fine white powder. The baked bread is beige, and it tastes more delicate and tastes sweeter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starch is based on refined wheat flour, and continues to be purified," Roland said. "When you recruit people, I will send someone to be specific." The practice tells them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue, continue processing?" Barov couldn't help but widen his eyes. "How much wheat must I use?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't need too much, three or four hundred kilograms..." Roland paused and changed his mouth. "Like my desk so big." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He nodded and asked, "Why do you ask for women as much as possible?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Because they are more careful in doing things. Moreover, I hope to see more women on the job, rather than staying at home," Roland suddenly thought of. "At present, the popular education in Bianyan Town seems to be the progress of the women's class. Faster?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Although the main person in charge of the Ministry of Education is Ms. Book, the situation is indeed this In addition to taking care of children and taking care of housework, they have not done much, so they spend most of their time reading and literacy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, I Require that when the next round of assessment is over, the city hall you are responsible for must recruit a group of female apprentices and gradually expand the proportion of female positions," Roland said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Highness, this... no precedent," Barov frowned. "If you only talk about your heart, my apprentice is no worse than any woman." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Create a precedent without precedent," Roland said bluntly. "This is also the easiest and quickest way to grow the workforce without expanding the total population." If all women can take on the task of building a small town, my available staff can double. All you have to do is lead people to change their mindset - as long as the salary is attractive, I think they will be one by one. Stand out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Barov retired, the nightingale laughed at the prince's ear, "What are you going to do something delicious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starch? No, it is not for eating," Roland drank a cup of tea, "although it is indeed possible to get the same good ingredients during processing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infuse delicate wheat flour into water, then knead and wash until the water is completely white A pot of water back to continue. The last remaining messy substance is gluten, which can be used for deep-fried or stir-fried, with a soft and elastic taste. Applying honey or mixing spices after baking is a great treat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
