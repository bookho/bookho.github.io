			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at the North Pearl with some surprise. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the ambush squad was designed by Erskuk, there was a whisper in the top, and the staff was responsible for the misjudgment, especially Minister of Isis Kant. In addition to the Executive Office, the Sleeping Curse also circulated a voice of dissatisfaction and doubt. If it is not Tiley's prestige, I am afraid that the influence will be further expanded. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when Itis came back from the front line to report his duties, he personally punished him, and he not only did not agree, but also suppressed this series of aftermath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is not a human error. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t say that victory or defeat is a common occurrence in the military. Torch action is not a failure, but a complete victory – at the cost of less than five hundred people. , nearly 20,000 devils were eliminated before and after, and the completed tasks were successfully completed, and the holy city lost for hundreds of years was taken from the devil. If this can't be called victory, what else is the victory? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contribution of the staff is obvious to all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Roland has discussed this issue privately with Tilly, Ai Gesha, El Wei and others. They also believe that the deviation of strategic judgment is due to certain Unable to understand the factors, in exchange for the era of the Federation, the devil can never be because a few witches give up the opportunity to swallow the mainland, even if it is three seats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, Isis will still be in the air for some time, plus this "match" is indeed she lost to Ers Luke, Roland thought that she would be depressed for a while, or to talk less, so as not to fall back to the population, I did not expect her to retreat, and an opening is a different view from others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...What's the problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First is the last two sentences," Itty Silk bowed two steps. "There is ten times more troops. If you don't, you should go all out. It's too strange. Isn't it? Since the ultimate goal of the devil is still to eliminate humans, then the importance of Taqila should be like us. As expected, even if the pressure caused by the Tianhai world is so great, it will not give up so rashly. After all, in this letter, the enemy suggests to go back and destroy us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty groaned, "Really...why didn't they do it early in the morning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the red fog can't keep up?" The nightingale held his chin with his fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not possible to go to the nest, but if you invest ten times more, you can’t do it if you invest more in transport troops, let alone they have a giant skeleton. Such a new type of war equipment." Ai Gesha frowned. "From the tower No. 1 station to the tower No. 10, we spent more than half a year, which is enough for the devil to make a choice."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The initial judgment of the staff came from Cabradorby - that is, the guy's confession: the devil was dragged by the heavens and the sea, and the result of the war was They are vital to life and death." Itis looked to the high-level devil who was glaring at the interrogation desk. "From this letter, even if they lose to the Tianhai world, they will not suffer the catastrophe, and even have the chance to win." Why did the enemy not support Taqila from the beginning? This does not make sense - from the perspective of intention and behavior, the two are contradictory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can not help but fall into meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is this sentence - "I know this will give you a criticism, but it will not affect your West Line plan," she After a while, Shen said, "It doesn't seem to be a problem, but when you think about it, you always feel that something is wrong... In order to deal with the sneaked witch, it is a real thing to throw Tacila, how can it be no plan? influences? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe Erskuk is fooling his official?" Roland thought, "The nobles usually do this--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, please consider it as the most difficult enemy! "Itis is in the same color. "If you can't imagine it, think of the other person as a devil. Do you think I will do something like this?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at her slightly clenched fists, Roland suddenly realized a lot of things. It turned out that she was not as calm as it looked, nor was it completely I was disturbed by the behind-the-scenes discussion, but I took a deep breath in my heart.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
