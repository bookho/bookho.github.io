			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In a nutshell, let those eyes explore opportunities on their own."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill. Fox picked up the pen and drew a tree on a piece of white paper. "Because our paying objects are intelligence rather than individuals, the more effective information is returned at the same time, the more rewarding it is." In order to get more news, they will definitely look for their own eyes. In the words of Your Majesty, this is called development downline."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out," Iti Silk quickly grasped the key point. "In order to get along the line, the line must also give certain benefits, which will make it possible for the downline to continue to develop offline."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Hill nodded. "You are right. Whether it is a sentinel or a spy, they are all a single end. No matter how long it takes, nothing will change. This makes the information they get relative to Reliable, but also limited by the field of vision."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But the mouse is always a mouse..." The iron axe frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, adults, the most interesting thing about this method is that the upper and lower lines do not represent the upper and lower levels. The soldiers are always on the line, and the rats are The downline is not necessarily a mouse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as the benefits are right, the mouse can also turn the nobility into their own eyes." Itis answered word by word. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hill’s eyes showed a bit of admiration, “Yes, the benefits are not just Golden Dragon. Everyone’s needs are different, and whether you understand this Demand, regardless of class. This means that the development of the downline may occur across the hierarchy. The current information is extremely messy and unclear because of the mouse's vision. When the intelligence line expands to the upper level, the value of the message will inevitably The higher the rate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m thinking for a moment, “Even so, those who are in contact with higher classes will have to wait a long time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If it's in peacetime, it's true." Hill replied, "But now the winter has changed dramatically, I think the intelligence line. The expansion may be faster than we think. In fact, these scattered news have revealed this point faintly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example?" The axe touched the chin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill laughed. "According to statistics, the content of the nobility in the recent intelligence is declining. Even if there is, there are mostly negative news, such as gathering people, and fighting in the streets. For the incumbent, this is not the state that should be in the war. It disguisely reflects that the upper layer of the winter has deviated from their original functions, and the pressure they are subjected to is also increasing, so it can only be used in this way. To slow down. Trace back to its source, the transition is likely to start with the first army migration team to defeat the nobility ambush."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paused, then said, "Although I was still in the morning, I was able to imagine the news of the news against the nobility. Once the hearts of the people float, the opportunity will follow, and the people who usually disdain will become life-saving at certain moments. Straw - please rest assured that the day should not be too long."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**************** ***<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yongdong, Xueyingbao. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, let everyone wait. The host is physically stunned today, and it is really impossible to see the guests. Please ask the adults to go back first." Everyone bowed. "When the owner's body has improved, he will definitely give it to everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall blasted the pot in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have been waiting for a few weeks! Even if he is ill, he will not be able to come out and see it all?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't need any shit to explain, let me call him, and where is the good territory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Yes, even if it is not convenient to see the guests, it is OK to take out the title deed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This housekeeper lied, I saw Viscount Nanor yesterday. After entering the castle, it took two hours to come out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
