			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Beauty Beauty slowly approached the dock, and Tilly walked out of the cabin and saw that the dock was already full of greeted witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tilly, you are finally back!" Morrier, with the help of the magic servant, first rushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, okay!" Honey said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the track? Open the door and let us pass!" The shadow followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t make trouble, my ability is not for you to harass Mr. Tilly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a burst of laughter in the crowd, looking at the heartfelt smile on everyone's face, and Tilly felt that the depression in her heart had dissipated a lot in the past few days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, here is her home, a country founded by witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the dock, Kamila Darry greeted him. "You have been going for a long time, I am worried that you will not come back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How come," Tilly laughed. "I just didn't expect this evil demon month to last so long. How, sleepy island is okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, since you handed it over to me, I naturally wouldn’t live up to your expectations," Camilla said, "all in all. It is a good idea to have a "sleeping curse". I will report it to you later, but now... I will hand you over to all the witches," she blinked. "Otherwise, I have to be swallowed up by them." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a great aristocrat of the kingdom, Kamila is very good at management affairs, and is also the main executor of Tilly’s action in convening witches. She, Tilly dared to leave the fjord for a long time, to go to the kingdom of the kingdom to find out.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head helplessly, crossing the "sleeping island big butler", just Raising his hands to the crowd, he was surrounded by layers of witches.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, have you seen your brother, what is he about you?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that there are witch organizations in the town, will they come over and live with us?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The people in that secluded town really do not lack food and clothing, but also live in new houses?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you are back, everyone misses you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly responded to the questions and concerns of the people one by one until the Sawyer flew up the dock with a pile of books, and everyone shifted their attention to this. Batch "priceless treasure".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this? "Someone is curious.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The literature in ancient relics? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do you look at it, the pages are new, probably a legend?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or is it a theater book? Seriously, I haven't seen a theatrical performance for a long time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...but what if I don't know how to read?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly took a clap and let everyone calm down for a while. "This is a gift from Roland Wimbledon to you - including reading and writing manuals." Basic mathematics and natural principles! Simply put, they are knowledge! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know... know? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of witches are confused. Only a few aristocratic witches, including Carmela, are surprised. "Do you want to teach everyone to learn?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly nodded. "This is also the only shortcut to improve our ability." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland once mentioned that universal education is not an easy task, it requires a lot of money and time - when people put down their work When you open a book and learn how to read and write, it means that you have temporarily lost part of the labor force in the territory. In addition, encourage them to actively learn the same financial support, plus the teacher's salary and school building. Together, it is not a small number. The key point is that it is not like buying and selling, it will not immediately show its effects, and it needs to be implemented by the governors.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the palace, she was knocked on the door as she prepared to follow the book's practice of arranging the education popularization plan. "Thunder wants to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hah, I haven't seen you for a long time, Your Highness," said the Thunder, who is still the same old-fashioned, smiley and friendly. "How, is this a trip to the West to solve your troubles?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To tell the truth, I didn't find the answer," Tilly smiled and shook her head. "He has reservations about me. In the current situation, these things have become less important... ... yes, do you know the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The monster that appears from hell?" Thunder raised his eyebrows, "I often hear in epic and legendary stories." The heroic knight comes forward and kills these ferocious and terrifying enemies with a spear of dragon blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This time, they are no longer It’s the enemy in the book.” She spit out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃...What do you mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know if the dragons exist, But the devils - they are real," Tilly told the Witch Federation and the battle of the gods in a concise and succinct manner. "The location of the four kingdoms, but the past wild land, once again, humans There is no way to retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is such a thing!" Thunder did not say a word, until after listening, he exclaimed, "all over the place The ruins are all from the witches, and Bianbu Town has found an ancient witch more than 400 years ago. This is really incredible! The harvest of your trip is more than the secret I discovered in my life. More!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilly is a little bit, "Are you not afraid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fear "Of course there will be..." He exclaimed. "But it is nothing compared to the burning desire of my heart. This fear is nothing at all! Hell, I really want to kiss. Go to the Grey Fort and see the living remains!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five kings are quite a bit sorrowful. The main purpose of going to the West is to see Ai Gesha. Instead of her own daughter, she doesn't know whether it is good to be happy or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no such experience of going out to sea, I am afraid that the greatest explorer of the fjord will only be given to you," Thunder said after a while. "But... I also found something that is very bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;"I went to the east of the "Sea Line" again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sea line? Tilly did not understand, "What is that?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, I forgot that I was still in the town when I came back last time. He touched the back of his head. "It is a cliff of sea water, which divides the sea into two planes, but the ship can walk freely on it, like a spider climbing a wall." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, this is impossible! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first time I saw it, I reacted like you, but the sea line does exist." "Thunder is proud to say," What is even more incredible is that I drove the courage to turn over the Shanghai line, and I was lucky enough to witness the whole process of a high tide - not seeing it with my own eyes, I absolutely could not imagine how spectacular the scene was. The seawater flow rate gradually increased, and finally rushed to the low point like a falling cliff. If it wasn't for Molier's servant to protect the ship, I am afraid that the courage will be broken on the spot! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I turned the steering wheel so that the bow was straight in the direction of the sea, and at the time it was just blowing the wind, the two were extremely clever Under the balance. The Spirit can't go any further, but it won't be washed down by the water. He said that he had a gasp here and seemed to be relishing the excitement at the time. "Of course, the waterline is not a real cliff. We have all seen what the waterfall looks like, the falling water curtain, the splash of water, and the impact of the water." The roaring sound - there can be nothing but the sea that accelerates the rogue. I know that even if the courage is to be pushed down the waterline, it is just like the process of climbing up, returning to the lower side. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Then? Tilly can't wait to ask.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
