			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the nightingale was finished, the room returned to silence, leaving only the occasional snoring of the candle burning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looks serious, he finally has a general understanding of the witch group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awakening of most witches occurs in the month of the demon, which is the day when the door to hell is opened. Generally speaking, adulthood is a dividing line for witches. Women who are still awakened after the age of 18 will no longer be likely to become witches. Those who wake up before the age of 18 will suffer from demon phagocytosis on the day of awakening. pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of pain is hard to imagine. When the nightingale speaks of this part, the voice is full of vibrato. According to her personal experience, it is like what I want. Breaking out, every blood vessel and tendons are unbearable, and at the end of the day, the skin will seep out of the blood, and the eyeballs will bulge out of the eyes...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If In the past, after four or five days of rest, the body will slowly recover, but if you can't keep it, you will die in this torture, and the death will be terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale has witnessed the death of several companions, their bodies losing support and becoming a swollen meatball. Blood and water are mixed with viscera from the body hole, and the air will turn into black fog. Eventually, when all the sprays are sprayed, there is only one layer of blackened skin on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is evidence that the witch is seen as the incarnation of the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary people see this scene early and scare the soul, who will care about the real cause of death? Coupled with the help of the church, it is said that the devil is the end of this, and over time, the witch becomes the spokesperson of evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of what an outsider thinks, this kind of torture is real, and the witch is generally short-lived for this reason. The more difficult it is to get to the back, many people choose to end their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 18-year-old adult demon corpse is the most difficult level to pass. In fact, the witch’s previous magic is not complete. Only in adulthood will this power be stabilized. The magic power after the stability has a substantial improvement compared to the previous one, and even a new branching ability can be derived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the process of stability is extremely painful, and the power of the phagocytic body is stronger than the limit that ordinary people can bear. Many witches will die on adulthood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland listened to silence for a long time before he whispered, "The ancient book records that the witch can obtain eternal peace in the Holy Mountain and no longer suffer from demon phagosomes. Torture, is this true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one knows, because the Holy Mountain has only appeared in the legend. But take them to the camp. The chances of living are greater. If the witch does not have to hide himself and live freely, the power of the phagocytic body will be much weaker than before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland The confusion is numb, and Anna’s and Nanawa’s help are indispensable in his plan, but because of his plans, he is in great danger, and he really can’t help it. In the end, he said with incompetence, "Anna is downstairs, I will call her over, if she wants, you will take her away. Nanawa, I have to see her tomorrow."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your understanding, I really didn't misread you," the nightingale rose to pay tribute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna at this time is still not sleeping, when Roland goes to call her, she is lying on the table and copying something. Seeing Roland, she looked a little surprised. When he heard that he was going to the prince's room, Anna did not ask a word, and followed the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I entered the room and found a person inside, the girl was really shocked. Roland took her hand and introduced it briefly. The three sat down around a round table. The nightingale repeated the words that were said before. "...In the camp, there are many people like you who are your partners."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably this is the case, Miss Anna, although I signed a contract with you, but in the case of possible life-threatening, I must respect your opinion. If you promise -"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't go."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland groaned, "What do you say-"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
