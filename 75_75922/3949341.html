			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it covers the surface of the object, a solid continuous film can be called a coating. The coating itself can be gaseous, liquid, solid, and its use varies. From the original aesthetic decoration to the durability of the later protected objects, it is considered a kind of coating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland went on a series of tests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test results made him very happy, probably influenced by the idea that "the painting can be saved as long as possible". Her previous photo paintings were very damaged if they did not destroy the carrier. It is difficult to completely eliminate it, and the ability to evolve has taken this feature to a new level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this high-viscosity, light-weight "pigment" exhibits two distinct properties in physical properties - it can be based on painting objects Differently change the flexibility of your material, such as when painting the sky or clouds, it is soft like cotton candy, and it is extremely resistant to stretching and shearing. When it is replaced by iron ingots and glass, it becomes hard and brittle and can be broken directly with a hammer. In other words, due to the limited quality, its performance in terms of flexibility is far superior to the rigidity, which is also in line with Soroya's understanding of pigments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, no matter which characteristic is exhibited, its chemical properties are very stable, not only does it react with dilute sulfuric acid or dilute nitric acid, but also exhibits water. And the repellency of oil. When he filled a paint-coated carton with water, the thin bottom of the box showed no signs of water seepage. After pouring out the water, the clear liquid beads roll in the box, like the dew on the lotus leaf. At this point, touch the bottom with your fingers and the feeling is still dry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the anti-high temperature test, after Anna dripped the molten iron into the paper box, the paper as the carrier suddenly burned, and the coating itself was not only opened by the molten iron. Not a little bit, there is not much change. It was not until Anna's black fire continued to heat up the burning coating, it began to melt and deform, while white smoke emerged, and finally turned into a black gel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most exciting thing for Roland is that the coating is also insulative. It can be regarded as the enameled wire of the later generation after wrapping the copper wire. He uses the yard. That simple DC motor proved this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Roland has a complete understanding of Soroya's new abilities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s different from the black fire of Anna’s all-rounder. Her evolutionary ability is more like an extension of her previous painting ability. Now she can draw The imaginary "oil painting" can also draw the thin "photograph" of the previous one. It depends only on the thoughts in her mind. The two abilities can be used in parallel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, when drawing a thickness of the picture, if the thickness is controlled below one centimeter, Soroya can almost continuously draw for several hours. Once you pass three centimeters, the magic consumption will increase rapidly. After ten centimeters, you will reach a threshold. You can only draw one or two strokes with almost all the magic. Of course, from another perspective, this is also the fastest and most effective method of catharsis when faced with magical phagosomes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It still belongs to the summoning ability. Within the scope of the healing stone, the magic pen will suddenly disappear, and Soroya can no longer draw new patterns. However, the coating that has been drawn is not affected by the stone of the gods. Under the observation of the nightingale, there is no trace of magic remaining on it—in other words, the material produced by the magic pen is real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the use of coatings...that is too much. Soroya will never think of how much change her new ability can bring to the town, which means that Roland can get a batch of water supply pipes coated with rust-proof materials, as well as large bundles of enameled wires, even high temperature resistance. Fire bricks. The three-way project (water, electricity, and access) that seemed to be out of reach, suddenly saw the dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, this also gave him a reminder: the perception of personal experience is far more profound than the axioms in books. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the witches can see the microcosm more intuitively, will they add to the process of particle theory and lead to a new round of evolution? For example... a microscope that observes cell structure and microbes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland feels it is necessary to try something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; North slope furnace group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blowing the wind! Let the fire burn a little more!" Lotya shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Carl Vabert sent a letter to Bianbu Town, he thought it was a deserted and barren land. If it was not written that the stonemason would be able to regain his life here, he would not want to go to the border of the kingdom. Return to the old business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell to the family, after packing out, he is ready to drink porridge and live in a tent. As for no one, no money, no money. That is a problem that is often encountered during construction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lossia also did not intend to stay in Bentham for a long time to see Carl, the old friend who had known each other for many years, to see the stonemason who would be exiled or reclusive, he I am satisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the reality is always incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he arrived in the town by boat, he saw Carl Vabert at the pier, the outstanding stonemason of the Grey King, and the powerful leader of the guild. competitor. Compared with the appearance in memory, he has white horns and a few wrinkles on his face, but his body is not thin, but he has a lot of strength, and even his face has shine. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few colds, Carl did not take him to the noisy construction site, but led him to a clearly new residential building. I handed over a key and said, "This room is yours. Let's put the luggage first. Let's go to the pub and have a drink."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......and then Losia I heard a series of incredible stories from the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl was recruited into the City Hall by the lord as a civilian, becoming an official with a fixed monthly salary, and also the head of the construction department! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you stay with yourself, you can also work in the City Hall! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free a set of homes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten years, you can get a retirement allowance! What is a retirement allowance? Just don't work, you can take money! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lossia thought Carl was drunk at the time, and he didn't expect it... he said it was true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adults, the ore is melting, I saw the flow of molten iron!" the worker at the top of the stove shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open the slag discharge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After working, what Losia envisioned No problem has arisen. The upper part not only asks people to give money, but also gives money to the money, and it is especially fast. It is often the case that the next day will be answered. In addition, this place also produces a kind of alchemy material called cement, which can quickly bond the masonry, making the construction progress by leaps and bounds. He feels an unprecedented happiness here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just one month, Losia built five furnaces with blast sacs and three shaft furnaces for ironmaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shaft furnace in front of him is the work he has been thinking about for many years after he left the stonemason meeting. He thought that the works of the past experience can only be passed down in the form of drawings. I didn't expect to have a day of turning it into a finished product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This improved shaft furnace is nearly two meters high and has an internal diameter of about seventy-five centimeters. There are a plurality of tuyères at the bottom of the furnace body, which can be used for blasting and pumping, and a slag discharge port and a molten iron flow outlet are left at the bottom. Beside the shaft furnace, there is also a slope made of sandstone to facilitate the workers to feed and observe the situation inside the furnace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the day when the first shaft furnace was officially put into use. Before the furnace is opened, a smelting inspection should be carried out according to the usual practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After opening and closing the slag opening more than ten times, and adding two cars of charcoal to the furnace, the inspection is basically qualified - there is already molten iron in the stove At the bottom, the slag discharge is unimpeded, and the temperature can meet the smelting needs at this moment. It is not necessary to continue to waste charcoal. After all, in order to reduce the loss, the initial furnace inspection uses the waste mine in the corner of the yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the taphole to drain the molten iron, Losia announced the shutdown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, the townspeople who cleaned the hearth dig out a few dark stones . Under high temperature baking, other waste mines have been reduced by several laps. The only few ores that have just been thrown in have not changed, but the surface is brighter, and the black is like ink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
