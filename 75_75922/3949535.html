			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to say that you have left the family, you should not return to the territory of Sirte, but the film is not to answer your doubts... but to father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the banquet, Sir Sirte not only talked about the people in the painting, but also felt very emotional, saying that the family exists because of her kindness, but grandfather The generation failed her kindness. Film couldn't understand these words at the time, but his father's demeanor made him remember it—a kind of regret for his grandfather's generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is a pity, will there be a chance to remedy? Perhaps the woman I saw was the descendant of the family creator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, he left the family because he did not want to be separated from Irene. As the eldest son, the family could not accept that he officially married a civilian. This is only the choice of the two sides, not the Sylt family is sorry for themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After welcoming Irene, Sir Sirte did not see him once, but the mother still sent some daily necessities and a letter. Tell the father that he has forgiven him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, Film made the decision to bring the news to the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the influence of the demon moon, the number of ships to and from the two places has been greatly reduced. He waited for the merchant ship from the fortress three days later, plus the time for unloading the goods. Arriving at the Long Song Fortress is a week later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walked off the dock, the film immediately felt the desertedness of the city. The snow on the ground had high ankles, except for a few lanes that left some shades. The footprints of the streets are flat and flat, indicating that no one has passed. Compared to the border town where people come and go, it is hard to believe that this is the largest city in the West. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The territory of the Silt family is in the north of the fortress, a village of nearly two thousand acres. Even the fortress is like this, and the village is even more unbearable. Walk along the carriage and walk to the mansion, and you can see some hungry hungry along the way. The heavy snow that begins to fall in the fall will make most of the poor unprepared. No matter whether food or firewood is stored enough, half of them may Unable to stay in the spring of the year. Originally, this is a normal phenomenon in the evil month, but Feilin is somewhat unaccustomed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several sparse wooden houses, the film returned to the door again after many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The iron gate of the yard was closed, and the vestibule was covered with snow, but several stone roads were cleaned up. Obviously, there are still people in the family who are taking care of it. Manor's. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He patted the iron gate hard, and in a few moments, two guards came out of the house, and one of them quickly recognized the identity of the film, and was surprised. Color Road, "You, you are... Big Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to see Sir Sirte," said the film calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although everyone in the house knows that dawn dawn has broken off with the family, but this is a matter of nobility, the guards do not dare to make their own claims, the two are very Open the iron gate quickly, one person led him to the foyer to wait, and one person informed the butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill didn’t think that the first one to come over was actually his own brother, Miso Sylt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not here, why are you coming back?" He frowned and looked at his brother. "You are coming over? What are you doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not a knight anymore," Ferien smiled. "Nature will not be awkward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, I am almost forgotten, you have been beaten by the prince of Bentham Town, become his captive, he put you back?" Miso snorted, "Is there no money for winter? I can give You point, then you consciously leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of the other party makes the film sigh, he has such a reaction is not difficult to understand - Miso. Sirte has now become the first heir to the family, and naturally does not want to come back again, lest it be extravagant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not coming to get the money, I have no intention of competing with you for the successor position," Xiao Xiaochen said, "His Royal Highness hired me as a mentor." I am very satisfied with my current life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not about teaching nobles, but about teaching civilians to read and write."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teach the civilians..." He sneered. "The lies you made are really interesting." Wouldn't it be that the civilian wife is so confused that you are unconscious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough!" There was a low drink behind, and Miso was one. Trembling, the film looked at the sound and found that the person is his father, Sir Sir. "Ms. Irene is not inferior to the nobility. What is lacking is only an identity. If you go on, it will be rude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz did not pay attention to the second son, "Listen to the guard, do you have a message to tell me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes." Film line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So come to my study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill followed his father to the study on the second floor of the mansion. When he passed the hall, he took the opportunity to look at the wall with portraits in the hall. The appearance of the blue-haired woman appeared again in front of him. The people seen in the convenience market are almost exactly the same. And unlike other portraits, the color of this painting is extraordinarily bright, and the details are much more refined, even the tears at the corners of the eyes are clearly distinguishable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the study, the jazz first took the initiative. "I saw your wife when the autumn theater was performing. Her looks are very good. The acting is also in front of Miss Mey. It’s not eclipsed, it seems that you have a very good life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filling suddenly felt a hot eye, he did not expect his father to mention this first, after a moment of silence Nod, "Yes, we have our own home in Bianbu Town, and we plan to have a child after the end of this evil month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's good, "Silter slowly drank the tea. "It should be very difficult now to come from Bianbu Town. What do you want to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn dawn Feeling, "I met a woman in the town. She looks exactly like the person in the portrait in the hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jazz is shaking, Almost knocked over the teacup, he raised his head and widened his eyes. "What do you say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rare blue hair, good looks I am sure that I have not read it wrong," said Feilin. "Is she going to be a descendant of the person in the picture?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible! That person is-" After a voice, then shook his head. "She can't have a descendant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes... is this?" Feilin bowed his head. "So maybe I got it." Wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you rushing to the Long Song Fortress for this matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, because I remember that you used to... expressed regret."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Sirte bowed his head and thought for a while, "Really the same? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to the slight difference in hair length..." Fly back, "The rest is exactly the same. You know, from birth to now, I am only I have seen such hair color in the portrait, so I will pay special attention to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She can't be the descendant of that person," Jazz hesitated. "But she There may be people in the picture . "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; to my father so that film almost could not believe my ears, the idea is simply more incredible than their own ideas," itself? What do you mean... Has she lived for more than four hundred years? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't want to tell you this," he said, "She is a witch." Since it is a witch, anything can happen. follow me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "The basement, I have something to show you," the Duke said in a word, "The inheritance from the ancestors is also what she left behind." Relics." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
