			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fortress, the inner city garden mansion. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Highness of Roland Wimbledon launched a raid on the palace and destroyed the temple, Tassa’s status rose and the members of the pigeons and hats were all right. He is respectful and the intelligence organization is really solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these core personnel, more than half a year of operation has allowed Tassa to influence the decision of the fingers, and the movement of other mouse organizations, he is also basic Clearly clear – whether in the patrol or in Black Street, there are eyeliners he buys. If you just have to ask for money, these people don’t care who they are. The place that still cannot be infiltrated is the upper aristocrat. It is a place where family life and knighthood are paying attention. It is impossible to play a golden dragon. However, with the mouse heads who are inextricably linked with the big nobility, some less important news is also I can often leak into his ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the one he heard now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tefico will send a team of about 500 people to block the Chishui River?" Tassa tapped the chair rail. "He is really "Is it going to do this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Yanshan snorted. "At least half of the blood is a rat, this is what the boss said. Because it is a Poor fat, yesterday, the gang also guilty, and died five or six."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is indeed a fat," the clown whistled, "think Look, what can they intercept? Merchant ships! What are the consequences of violating the King’s ban? Of course, the goods are confiscated, and then the blackmail is on the line! Is this thing better than the mouse? Of course ...the patrol is not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since half of them are mice, I think the other half is the guardian of the pseudo-king," Hill Fox said quietly. "This morning, someone noticed the emergence of four eagle boats in the outskirts of the dock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa The wrinkle brows, the eagle boat is a river warship, the hull is slender, there are sails and paddles, and the speed is very fast. Below the waterline, there are raised angles of impact. The sides of the ship are also equipped with iron hooks. Once they catch up with the target, they can be locked tightly together, so that the soldiers on the ship can jump over and fight. It is difficult for a merchant ship to escape its pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So the intelligence is integrated, the pseudo-king is going to send a fleet of 500 people to block the Chishui River, including four warships and more than two hundred "I am a heavily armed guard?" he sighed secretly. "This is not good news."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco wants to block the road plan as early as evil The wind was released a few months ago, but at that time most people thought that he would set the checkpoint near the canal. The ban on trade with the West was just a matter of saying - after all, the lords of Silver City and Chishui City would not I am willing to see that I lost a lot of money in vain due to an inexplicable order, forcing the checkpoint to be placed on the border between the West and the Central. It will only let the local lords sneak out these levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with four warships, the situation is different. First, the other lords have almost no water combat capability, and the warships follow the Chishui River to go freely. The team may be intercepted in any place, even if you want to move the knife in the ground. Secondly, this reaction shows Tiefco's determination to deal with the West - even if he will be evil with other lords, he is determined to do so. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasa looked to Hill, and the latter nodded to him, and seemed to think of this too, "Tefco probably won’t set a fixed level, and It is the use of the Chishui River to attack any caravans that they see. They are pirates when fighting on the water, and they are thieves on the beach. The size of 500 people is a nightmare for any caravan. So, the West may be true. "The supply of materials has been cut off."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I will report this message to my Highness as soon as possible," Tassa said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bianzi Town purchased a large amount of food, clothing and ore resources in the previous year, and now has annexed a long song fortress, the theoretically needed materials will be further expanded, If the trade line is cut off, it will be a great trouble for His Royal Highness Prince, and he will not know whether he can solve this tricky thing smoothly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the sound of wings flapping in the garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasta got up and pushed open the back door, an ashes like a lightning bolt into the house, hovering over his shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
