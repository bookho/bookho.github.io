			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ha, surrounded? Don't pretend! Any fluctuation in the power of nature can't survive Alpha -" the words of the martial arts just said half, I was stunned by a container that flew horizontally. The huge impact made him roll over and go out, and he also broke his voice between his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another traitor stunned and watched the witches fly out of the hidden places, some from the underground, some from the sky, but more It’s out of thin air, as if they had been waiting there for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation is completely contrary to common sense, so many people are hidden in a distance of less than ten meters, even if there is no natural force fluctuation, it should be able to detect Their breathing and footsteps are right! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the demon who acted as an whistle not give an alarm? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no extra time for thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the two people will be together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original silent dock yard suddenly boiled! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit has always been outside the scope of the searchlight circle - light and shadow are always accompanied Life, the high overhead lights illuminate the yard, but also make the darkness behind the metal box more intense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has long chosen her goal: those who stand on the heights. They dragged a long figure behind them and connected them to the back surface of the box, which was a natural flaw left for her. If someone looks at the back of the enemy as they approach the enemy, they will see an amazing scene - her entire body disappears into the shadows, leaving only half of the head exposed, and a few bubbles from time to time under the nose. , but will not make any sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of being in the shadows is warm and comfortable, even if it is the world's hot spring bath, it can't be compared with it. Since she turned into a god of punishment, she I thought I couldn't relive this feeling anymore, until a year ago, Philly Ribbon returned an incredible news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange world that will allow them to return to the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ling saw this new world at first glance, and liked it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also changed from a somewhat mundane mortal king to an inviolable candidate, even if he could not activate the Scorpio instrument. She always tries to find ways to get more dreams with Pasha, Celine and others, and is chosen as a protector of witches. It is also an opportunity for her to lobby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight against the devil is of course the most important mission, but without violating this principle, it is best to relax yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So anyone who wants to be unfavorable to the underworld or to destroy the world of dreams is an unforgivable enemy of the Takira witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the instructions of the hands-on instructions, the spirit like a ghost generally rises from the shadows, inserting a short knife into the chest of the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These enemies will not be fatally injured by ordinary weapons, so an additional action is required - injecting magic into them. Under the influence of the magical force swarming, she can clearly feel that the speed of the other star's star is no longer stable. This situation is quite similar to the mutual interference between the ability effects, and also confirms the underarms from another aspect. View: There is no essential difference between the power of nature and the magic. They all come from "erosion." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, you can pick up the corroded core and the enemy will make a mess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the moment the sorcerer fell, she had crossed the top of several boxes a few meters apart and appeared behind the other slayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a fierce killing sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, all the enemies who took the whistle were swept away by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betty's superb superposition made her a superb existence in a short time. She held the iron box in the forefront with one hand and rushed the next round of the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash and Felice are still extremely tacit partners, and the latter’s blade will appear whenever the former shines with glare to make the enemy lose sight. In the most deadly part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 潼恩,罗瑟...Everyone is all this, this kind of bloody battle seems to make the spirit return to the era of Taqila. She couldn't help but look at Roland - perhaps even he didn't realize the meaning of the dream world for the Taqila witch. It is not only a place to regain touch and enjoyment, but also to let their infinitely tight heartstrings relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hundreds of years when the Three Holy Citys were overturned and the Federation split, it was arguably the darkest time of their survivors, although everyone With a sigh of relief, I tried my best to adapt to the new body, but the feeling of fading away made them lose the joy of being alive. In addition, the plan of the winners has no clue. Everyone is under tremendous pressure. Even if they change their bodies, they can continue. The mental state of everyone is falling day after day. The spirit even suspected that they might not need the devil. I will be crushed by pressure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the third side of the city is full of vitality, everyone is excited to discuss which takeaway is best, the forgotten perception is a little bit Pick it up again. Even if you don't enter the world of dreams, you can still hear laughter and laughter, which is different from the sight of a hundred years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit knows that the feelings of the sisters are almost the same as her, so it will show such a high momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream world must not tolerate the existence of these enemies of erosion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She jumped up and jumped into the shadow behind a demon slayer and joined the melee below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as the container was thrown by Betty, Roland had already rushed On the other hand, one ran into the man led by the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the magical creatures’ experience of several encounters, these monsters that are extremely tricky for martial arts are the biggest variables on the battlefield, no matter the different areas of black and red. Or those twisted black tentacles, it is quite troublesome to deal with, even if the witch is entangled, it is difficult to get out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the power of the magic creature has no effect on him. As long as the leader is dragged, the witch will naturally solve the remaining enemies. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is like Roland expected, when Alpha found himself unable to get rid of his restraint for a while, the tone of the beginning of the high has finally changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All said that I am the creator here," Roland didn't want to give the other party a chance to speak. Anyway, it was also a few words. He has heard it for several times. "How is God made it, how is God made it great?" He pressed it to the ground, while he was indignant. While slamming toward the enemy's face, until the weird mask is torn apart, revealing the rotating disk below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its face is a huge core. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not hesitate to grab the chart and pull it out until it completely fell off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment, the power of jubilation in the body suddenly sprang out, swept the star plate into a beam of incomparable light, and rushed straight into the sky from his hands. As if I felt the call of the light column, the cores that were peeled off from the demon were scattered into a few stars, and they came together to reflect the dark night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling that the world is changing faintly reappears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is not the end... the light column is getting brighter and brighter, and there is no weakening momentum until he is completely covered! Roland felt something was madly pouring into his mind, and a violent sting caused him to almost lose consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything in front of him has become blurred, and countless snowflake pieces fill his field of vision, as if it were black and white television in the seventies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
