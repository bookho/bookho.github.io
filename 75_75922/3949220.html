			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The latest broadcast] Tomorrow is 515, the beginning of the anniversary, the most welfare day. In addition to the gift bag, this time the "515 red envelopes mad" must be seen, red envelopes do not grab the truth, set the alarm clock ~<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just in Roland When the base was installed on the ground, the three figures suddenly emerged from the void, and when they landed, they fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ann was frightened and jumped, and a cluster of green flames swelled into a wall of fire, blocking the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked up and found that one of the women was a long night. Her appearance looked very embarrassed, and the unusual redness appeared on her cheeks. It was clear that the wind was blowing outside, and her forehead was covered with dense sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, please call Nana Va, hurry up!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up and shouted Road, anxious feelings are beyond words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland has noticed that the woman tied to her back is pale and her eyes are closed. Half of the arms were empty, and the cloth wrapped in the break had been stained dark red by the oozing blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kadan, go to the hospital to bring Nana Va!" He tightened his heart and shouted at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Highness!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two, there is also a night clip The little girl in the majesty. She didn't seem to have a problem, and her eyes were looking around curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not injured?" Roland stepped forward to untie the cloth belt behind the nightingale and unloaded the broken arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm fine, Your Highness, cough... Sorry, I didn't bring back the sisters of the Co-Help," the nightingale gasped, her voice weak and weak, apparently she After a long period of trek, the physical strength is almost overdraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't want to say anything, take a rest first," Roland picked up the unconscious, seriously wounded woman, and then let Anna hold the nightingale, five people together. Return to the castle. The nightingale room was next to Anna. He ordered the maid to raise the fire and prepare a large bucket of hot water in the house. After Nana Wah arrived, he simply explained the cleaning of the wound before treatment, and first stepped out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as she is not dead, Nana Va can restore her wounds to their original condition and save lives. The nightingale also specially brought the woman's broken arm back together, but the arm has been bleeding for a long time, and he does not know if he can still pick it up. The next cleaning and treatment needs to take off the clothes. As a new generation of red, Roland consciously chose to avoid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how can things get like this? He thought to himself, is it that the camp was attacked by evil beasts, so that only three people escaped? If this is the case, it is a huge loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was uncomfortably squatting outside the door. After about half an hour, the door was pushed open. The first thing that came out was the one who followed the nightingale and looked A little girl who is unscathed. She nodded to Roland. "You really are the same as the nightingale."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Roland didn't come back for a moment, "She said what I did. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" "A prince who cares about witches." "The other party gently closed the door. "Unfortunately, the news was too shocking, so most of the people did not believe her. In fact, I don't believe much, but as my dad said, the world is so big, everyone will have it. My name is Lightning, Your Highness, I am very happy to meet you. "That's why she lowered her head and put her right hand on her left shoulder - it was probably a way of salute.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Roland’s mind was not placed on it. He keenly captured the phrase "most people don't believe her." “Is there no attack by the evil beast in the camp?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Attack? No... Why do you ask this?” She ordered herself with her index finger. The forehead, then revealed a look of ignorance, "Oh, I understand. The big sister whose arm is broken is Wendy, she was injured by the coach of the Communist Youth League, Hakala." Then, lightning will pass things around. Tell it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
