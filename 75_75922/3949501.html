			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The geeks who rushed out of the crowd were all killed, and the sudden changes caused a fluster of the emigrants. Dozens of warriors wearing exotic weapons gathered around and screamed at the scene. The sound is constantly changing and the situation gradually becomes uncontrollable. At this time, the loud voice of His Royal Highness suddenly rang through the crowd--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quiet, my people. I am your lord, Roland Wimbledon. Now Listen to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is large, but it is not a hysterical bark, but a clear and steady statement. Vader felt that the other person was talking to his own ear. There was an indisputable power in his words, which overwhelmed the embarrassment and panic of the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd is suddenly quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you heard from the news, Bianbu Town will provide you with shelter from the wind and snow, able to fill your stomach and provide a lot of pay. A lot of work. I am here to tell you that these are true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The house is a thick earthen house, there is no gap in the air, under the bed With a charcoal stove, sleeping on it is as comfortable as lying on the grass that has been baked in the summer sun. As long as the doors and windows are closed, even if you only wear a single coat in the room, you will not feel cold."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Food is a porridge with dried meat. You can see the granules dripping with a spoon. When you pour it into your mouth, it will fall slowly because of the consistency. Just one The bowl will fill the stomach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard this, Vader suddenly felt hungry. The content of His Royal Highness is very novel. He did not repeatedly emphasize his power and the obligations of the people like most nobles. He claimed that everyone under the rule must follow his own will, but from the perspective of the people’s most concerned. Eat and wear to describe your promise, look at the expression of the fascinating faces of the people on the dockside, know that his words are undoubtedly more touching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that all the people can live a good life, but the enemies hidden in the dark do not want to see this scene. The beasts that come out are undoubtedly sent by them. The reason is very simple. They don't want to see that I am still alive, and I don't want my people to live a comfortable life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If I am not there, will there be other lords to provide warm housing and delicious food? You should be very clear about this. You can understand what you have experienced before. You are willing to do so. I am alone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wade found that the panic dissipated, and when those monsters whose actions are not like ordinary people are regarded as common enemies, the uneasiness and worry of the displaced people Gradually turned into anger - the murderers who tried to be unfavorable to His Highness, and the villains who wanted to destroy their good life, such people must not be forgiven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In order to prevent the attack from happening again, the inspection needs to be repeated again. This time, my escort is responsible for the search and verification, and never let any enemy have a chance to destroy it. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has followed the will of His Highness. The people who have crossed the checkpoint have been taken back to the dock area by the guards. No one has protested, and the order is even better than before. It’s still much more orderly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it is the prince of the prince, Vader can't help but feel that in just a few words, the impending panic is eliminated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you first discovered the problem?" Carter Lannis walked over and said, "Come with me, Your Highness will see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He followed the chief knight and came to the young prince, kneeling down, "gives you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Tell me, how did you find out that he was not right?" asked the prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vader reported his findings truthfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Keen observation, have you been an ordinary civilian before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Your Highness. I worked in the Jinsui City patrol," he replied honestly. "It took almost six years until Jinsuicheng was attacked by a large number of pirates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't indicate any special features on your resume," said the prince. "I asked Carter. He said that you are still in a temporary residential area. In other words, when the city hall registers the first-time population. You concealed your own experience - and this is completely unnecessary. Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
