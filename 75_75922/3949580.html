			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smoke is gone, and the woods return to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witch’s long scorpion is scattered, like a white flower laid underneath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the hot air flowed from behind, and soon formed a circle of dark red water, the blood slowly immersed in the ground, turned hard and cold The earth is filled with iron scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night squatting down, uncovering the gaze on the witch’s face and discovering that this face looks unexpectedly young, and the age should be similar to that of his own, just at both eyes. The scars ruined the overall beauty - her eyes were like a red-hot soldering iron, and the skin was brown and red, and the contours of the eyelids had been lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly caused by the day after tomorrow, the nightingale gently touched the wrinkled scars, as for what she suffered before becoming a witch, or after serving the church The suffering that has only been experienced is unknown. But these are no longer important. From this moment, she can't hurt more witches, and she doesn't have to suffer other tortures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searched the Holy Spirit and pulled out a letter, a seal and an emblem from the pocket of her robes. The emblem pattern is a circle that is divided into a cross with a fist in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, she didn’t carry more items – whether it’s gold dragons or jewelry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, she hasn’t enjoyed anything in her life, and she can’t help thinking about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, see what I caught," the sound of lightning came from midair, and she looked up and saw the little girl squatting with a man who was struggling He flew over and then threw him on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party made a pain, rolled over twice, and seemed to want to get up, but the hands and feet were tied, and they could only helplessly wriggle around the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at this person’s dress, it should be the priest or priest sitting in another carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about McMug?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She directed the ashes to pursue the runaway trials. "Lightning went to the Holy Spirit. "Is this the witch that the church cultivated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the nightingale whispered, "She won't hunt us again." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Looking at her appearance, it is hard to believe that she would regard us as an enemy that must be killed..." The little girl yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is no church, this will not happen," the night owl looked coldly at the captured man, while the latter saw the witch lying in a pool of blood, eyes immediately I was so eager to say something, but I couldn’t speak because of the cloth that was blocked in my mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled out the strip. "Do you have anything to defend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough . . . You, you have killed the pureness of Bishop Teflon, the devil who is daring, and you will be hanged by the church at the gate of the city sooner or later for the crows to eat!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "&nbsp; "Even if we didn't kill her, it wasn't much better to be caught by the church," said the Nightingale. "And compared to this, you still have to worry about your situation better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I die, I will receive the redemption of the gods, and you will only indulge in hell and suffer from eternal life!" he shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is why I have to block his mouth," Lightning beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale re-inserted the cloth strip back. "Go to the temple and dispose of it. Listen to him and say that the iron axe is very good at interrogating such people." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wheat stalks carried two sleeping island witches, it was afternoon. The ashes leaped from the back of the behemoth and landed firmly beside the nightingale. "Are you not hurt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nature is not running away," the gray smile proudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She is dead?" Andrea looked at the Holy See after the ground and said, "I thought you would leave her a life."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The enemy is a witch, any hesitation and carelessness are extremely dangerous behaviors," Gray said, "it is me, and it is impossible to make her alive." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you have no mercy on the same kind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is not us The same kind, but the embarrassment controlled by the church, "The extraordinary person does not think that," again, the same kind is sometimes more cruel than the alien class, at least I have never seen the evil beast or the devil will imprison people, repeated I have been tortured for several years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took off her bloody gloves and handed her hand to the nightingale. "Your actions and performances are amazing." Marvel, at this point, you are doing exactly right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The latter watched her for a moment before holding the hand she handed out," Thanks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turns out that even people like her will comfort themselves, thinking at night, probably not wanting to feel that they have too much burden to kill a witch. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning also pressed his hand over. "I think this victory is worth celebrating."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there was McMug, "Hey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia rolled her eyes and the last hand was pressed in the hands of everyone. "I have to explain if It’s just your hand, I don’t want to touch it at all, but it’s on the nightingale.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Okay, I know,” Ashes raised their eyebrows. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then five people then held their hands together in the sky, like a tower standing in the cold wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, in addition to collecting the information carried by the messenger, they also need to bury the battle The traces left, the pedestrians were busy in the woods for two days before they handled these trivial matters. It was three days after returning to Bianbu Town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landing in the back garden of the castle, the nightingale was immediately surrounded by sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that you were injured? Where is the wound?" Nana Wa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She has been waiting for you for a long time, how come back now," Lily dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You... do you feel pain now?" Lucia asked eagerly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These herbs are specially made by me, that is, they can stop bleeding, but also play a role in swelling. The effect should be good?" The leaves laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are too unscrupulous, and one dares to run into the church, I am afraid that I will not have such good luck next time!" This is Wendy. the sound of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, it’s good to be safe." This is the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at their concerns, the nightingale heartfeltly felt the warmth of the heart, she did not know what kind of life the witches of the church lived, but She knows what it is like in the Witch Alliance. There is no doubt that this is where she deserves to pay for everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she saw His Royal Highness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning has already plunged into his arms, like a gecko sticking to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜 also flew over Roland's shoulder and licked his cheek. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, although she wants to do this, she knows that she is no longer a child. She resists the urge to hug each other. She walks down to her highness and smiles. "I am back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I have been waiting for you for a long time," the prince’s smile is still as familiar as ever. "First take a hot bath, good. Take a break, I put a few packets of honey-boiled dried fish in the office drawer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
