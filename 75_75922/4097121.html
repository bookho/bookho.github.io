			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the brass horn came from a distance, breaking the silence of the noon, like the omen, and the birds in the courtyard stopped screaming. For a time, the castle hall seemed dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Willi. Borg knew that the time for the decisive battle had arrived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked away from the murals of Tiffco’s majesty and turned to look at a delicate body armor – the armor that his grandfather passed down. After many times of repairing and polishing in his hands, each piece of nail is immersed in oil, which is almost equivalent to another layer of skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right arm is engraved with a small line of words, which is the family rumor: "Loyalty is not forgotten." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wearing this armor, in the melee, with the arrow and rain, the old Duke of the rebellion, and was crowned as the new guardian of the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Tefco has fallen, the guardianship will not be interrupted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will never live up to this honor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Duke of the Great, the four princes' troops have moved closer to Jin Suicheng, and no traces of large firearms have been found in the ranks." A man walked into the hall and directed him. Report. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Very good," Willie nodded. "Notify others that they are in place. I will pass right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Follow!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he took off his coat and went to the armor and said to his chief knight, Greena, "I am armored." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the woman rolled up her sleeves and began to dress up for him. The rough hands covered with scorpions, like soft water at the moment, gently faded his coat and lining. It's hard to imagine that in the battle, Grenna also used these hands to hold a long gun and pierce the enemy with a shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever you see it, this scene makes him intoxicated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...repent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not, adults," Grenada Quietly replied, "When you decide to let a woman be your chief knight, I decided to stay with you forever, no matter what happens, I will do my part."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this time the enemy is stronger than ever, if you can--" The duke said halfway, and was interrupted by the belt that was tightened at the waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since you know that your opponent is strong, why do you want to reject the covenant of the Lord of the Morning? If you don't agree, you will also smash the messenger out of Jinsuicheng. If you know it, you will blame you for not knowing what to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, let’s not say that the help of the Glory City can withstand the army of the Four Princes. It’s enough to let me provide the harbor for his people to stay in.” Willie whispered, “East is the land that His Majesty gave me, let Anpein Moya and Jean Roland. Is there any difference? If I really agree with the other party, it will also disappoint my trust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then my answer is the same," Greena Without hesitation, "Loyalty is not the unique quality of the Borg family. Adults, please don't mention those words any more, otherwise it will be no different to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Willien was silent for a while before he said, "Unfortunately most nobles have forgotten this now... I understand, you follow me. Go. The opponents are strong, but I won't let them easily win the Golden Swords City - I have been waiting for this battle for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, adults." The knight laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bell!" He shouted the name of the clerk, "Come to me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a bald middle-aged man who walked in the hall very quickly. "Adult, what do you have to order?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Give me a good memory, the king After a night's rest, Roland Wimbledon officially launched an intrusion into Jinsuicheng today. The guardian of the East, the Duke of Jinsui, Willie Borg, in the name of the first king, decided to block the enemy's pace. His chief The Cavaliers Glenn Wien also walked with him, and his courage and loyalty were unmistakable—may the gods bless them.” Williene paused. “Of course... if you think this description is somewhat subjective, The last sentence can be written."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
