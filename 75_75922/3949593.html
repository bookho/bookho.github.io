			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this trip is quietly going, naturally no one will be greeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Otto did not intend to go straight to the castle from the beginning, and any words were less than what he saw with his own eyes. He planned to spend a day or two. Time, take a good look at the prince's territory, and then find the local mouse to understand the information. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the cabin, he just stepped on the trestle and was shocked by the sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is... a pier that can be owned by a border town? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of steps along the river bank that are piled up from reddish-brown masonry. There is a trestle and trestle at every other distance. There is also a sign on the dock connection with the number on it. Otto has roughly counted a total of twenty-six items - they are neatly arranged, like the tentacles that extend from the shore, some covered with snow, and some with yellow-brown wood. Even in the month of the demon, the docks of the town are still being taken care of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, the canal wharf of the Grey Fort Kings, no matter the length or the number of bridges, is less than half of it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what surprised him was the boat docked at the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unprecedented gray wide-body boat lined up in a row, not far from the front. They have a total of seven or eight ships, the water line is very shallow, there is neither a sail nor a mast, and the size of the hull is not like the paddler can move. The most unique of these weird ships is a huge wooden wheel on each side and a thick iron pipe protruding from the center. The shape is different from any inland river sailboat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otto waited for a long time, until the coolness came from the top of the head, and did not want to understand how these weird "ships" could move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beat the snow on his head, he put away his doubts and decided to follow the crew first into the town. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Shunfeng" from Wangdu obviously does not only transport one person himself, Otto sees the crew moving a bag of goods down the sailboat. Stacked on the side of the dock. Several guards in black uniforms used pen paper to record what they were doing. They also picked out two bags from time to time to check it out and seemed to be checking the goods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are they? The mercenary that the buyer invited?" Otto walked to the captain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha, mercenary?" the latter snorted. "These people are patrols in Bianbu Town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't help but a patrol? Doesn't that mean hitting a band of robbers? When I first left the inner city of Wangdu, the patrol team extorted two silver wolves, and this situation is similar everywhere - they are equivalent to the opposite side of the underground mouse, but the work is almost the same as the mouse, the difference That is, they charge more, and often do not take money. But what made Otto strange was that the captain was smoking a pipe, and did not stop them from checking, nor did he pull out a few silver wolves to let them leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first time I came here, it was the same as you thought," the captain seemed to see his thoughts. "The patrol here is different, as long as According to their rules, there is no need to pay any fees before entering the market."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patrol's rules? Otto frowned, this place even made sense of the robbers, and they also know how to use pen and paper to record, although it may be just awkward symbols, but it is enough to make people feel incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are they recording?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The type and quantity of the goods...especially wheat," the captain said. "After shipping to the market, check it out and avoid selling the food to you midway." Others - here, food can only be sold by the lord. Of course, there is no wheat in my goods, so the inspection will be faster."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the bags After being moved to the horse-drawn team, the group left the dock and headed for the market along the spacious street. Otto suddenly found that his eyes were not enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really the most remote territory of the Grey Fortress Kingdom? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
