			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode doesn't know how to get back to the temporary residence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is near dusk when you arrive at the door, people who are busy for a day are returning to their homes, and there are smog and snoring everywhere. The combination of fragrant and sweaty acidity highlights the busyness of the place. Although there are endless activities every day, everyone’s expression is full of vitality, and it is not like a colony of migrants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the hope that gives them vitality - as long as they are busy for a day, they can fill their stomachs for a few days, and if they are busy for ten days and a half, You can add two eggs or a slice of meat to the bowl, so people naturally have expectations. If they are busy for a year and a half, what will they look like? With this hope, everyone's voices are full of vigour, although the temporary residence is dirty and noisy, but there is no darkness and slum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything here is colored. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Goode. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more he looked at the smile in the neighborhood, the more he felt dizzy, and there seemed to be a voice echoing in his heart--"Hey, what have you done? Idiot, you ruined all that was hard to get!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, if you don’t shout out that scorpion and honestly accept the punishment, he will still It is a member of the Cavaliers Academy. Even if you don't become a driver, it's a good job, at least better than continuing to be a displaced person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no doubt that the answer was not hesitated at the time, but when the Royal Highness princess really agreed, the courage retreated as a tide, replacing all of them with guilty conscience. Scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it fails, he really has nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode pushed the door open and walked into the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crisp sound sounded, "Goode, come back, see what I did!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel happily ran to him, pushed him to the table and pressed it, then uncovered the porcelain pot on the plate, "Dangdang Dang - egg pancakes, how?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eggs and granola in the plate are divided into upper and lower layers, not so much as egg pancakes, but more like fried eggs on the crepe. However, this is not a failed dish. The protein is very thin, and the surrounding circle is curled up, the orange egg heart is slightly raised, and it remains smooth when it is not solidified. The fully-opened butter is sandwiched between the two and breaks into the pan from the gap, giving off a tempting aroma. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obvious that Rachel has worked hard on this dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode groaned, "Have you bought an egg?" Although the price of No Winter City is not high, for them, it is still not always eaten. dish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Rachel handed the wooden fork to him. "Today, with Uncle Bagy, I went to the convenience market. Don't worry, I brought it out." There is still a surplus, and you have a rare day off, and it is no problem to eat it once in a while. Besides, if you become a formal air knight, the savings will soon rise back, but I know what it is!" I took a chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode took the fork stiffly, "said...just said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Don't say anything, try my craft first." Rachel expects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hesitated for a moment, slowly put the soft egg into the mouth, in an instant, the heart of the egg spewed out, blended with the sweetness of the butter, Filled his entire mouth instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This delicious taste also hits the deepest part of his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the wolf heart all the way to the west of the gray fort, the two can be said to have suffered a lot, such food can not even think about it. After the absence of the Winter City, the situation has undergone a miraculous improvement. Not only has the residence stabilized, but the life of food and clothing is also just around the corner. Even the "flap pancakes" he eats, Rachel may be able to eat one every day. Instead of sitting and watching him eat - as long as he stays in the college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing in the past that I could lose, but now it is different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to take care of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, why did you make that choice because of your own private thoughts? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even promised Finchem to peek at the plane because he only considered himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So selfish people, now eating the food they have made with their heart, is simply too odious, isn’t it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, should... okay? I haven’t done this for a long time, and I don’t know if the craft has regressed.” Rachel’s five fingers Dao, "Hey, it won't work, you can say something... Wait, why are you crying? Am I doing so bad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No..." Goode shed tears and stuffed his mouth. "Good, you are doing so delicious, I am just... I just can't help..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel took a moment, then got up and walked over to him, reaching out and whispering his head, "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry...I may not be able to stay in college again..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On and off, Goode will do it myself Everything is said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turned out to be the case," Rachel was silent for a long time until he calmed down. "I just want to ask you a question. You... like to fly." "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I--" Goode opened his mouth, and under the other's direct view, he found that he couldn't say anything that was against his heart. After a long time I nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's it." Rachel laughed. "From small to big, is this the first time you have something you want to do? Even if it is Taking me out of that place is also my initiative. Whether you are on the wolf or on the road to escape, you have paid a lot for me, and these should have nothing to do with you, can do this, and How could it be a selfish guy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The worst The result is just starting from scratch, right?” she snarled. “And I am literate. Even if I don’t do it... I can find a lot of work. So no matter what you can’t do, try to do it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So...can it really be?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s too late to regret it anyway. Well, it's better to sever other thoughts and focus on it. Of course, the next time you encounter such a thing, think twice and don't think about it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;Goode looked at her for a while. "I think sometimes, you know more than me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The age is not It’s equal to knowledge. You have to let me be my sister.” Rachel whispered, then smiled. “If you were expelled from the college, just call my sister.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, the empty knight flight field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixteen reserve players lined up at the end of the runway - as the first batch of qualified players, they will also be the first to test flight People. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four new planes slowly slipped out of the hangar and stopped in front of everyone. There was a stir in the crowd, and everyone looked at the four beautiful cars with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finkin and Heinz are a sullen look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goode closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the cool morning breeze blowing in the face, he tried to grasp the feeling in his mind - day after day training, instructor's teaching, and grip At the moment of staying in the grip of the real machine, several pictures continue to rotate, gradually becoming indistinguishable from each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
