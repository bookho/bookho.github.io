			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sat at his desk and looked at the knights who came to report on the status of the First Army with great interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the meticulous appearance of a few months ago, Carter’s iceberg has a lot of other emotions on his face, and the sense of calm has faded a lot. More expectation and urgency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably related to the star of the West, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Carter’s recent move with Mey, Roland also heard a little. After all, as one of the top leaders of the First Army, his representative in the military, his every move has people pay attention, not to mention the beautiful women around Mei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they appeared side by side on the streets of the town for the first time, the guards had already spread the news to their ears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this kind of thing, Roland doesn't care. Carter's age is about two or three years older than himself. It is a strange thing to say that he hasn't been married. If you can find the other half in the West, it is not bad, as long as it does not affect the work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Xi’s report, the First Army has about two hundred revolver rifles in the package, adding almost ten new ones per day – In fact, if the raw materials are enough, Anna's production capacity can be doubled, but she is responsible for the production of pig iron steel and steam engines, and the degree is slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this degree is acceptable. After all, the first army has only 600 people, and it can be completely replaced in one and a half months. Until the new population expansion tide arrives, the size of the military cannot be further expanded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the formation of the Second Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the convenience of training and the need for confidentiality, the civilians recruited from the Long Song Fortress were approved by the Roland and incorporated into the Second Army. Disciplinary training is currently being accepted, that is, the military training. In the evening, it is an ideological education class, and strives to let these people develop themselves as guardians of the West. The safety of their loved ones requires their belief in protection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The training of the Second Army personnel is currently progressing well. It is expected that after another week, they will be able to transfer to the shooting training. At that time, the rifle eliminated It’s enough for one hand,” Carter concluded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the advantage of the musket. It takes at least a year to train a cold weapon warrior, and it takes about five or six years to train a knight. And the firemen can only fight in a month. The longer a battle is, the more dominant the firearms are - after all, pulling the trigger is more labor-saving than fighting the sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The live-fire shooting practice must pay attention to the management of the guns. How much will be recovered? The same is true for gunpowder. When practicing, the veterans of the First Army are responsible for Supervisor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," he nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good," Roland waved his hand. "If that's the case, go ahead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Oh, Your Highness..." Carter hesitated. "You said last time that the perfume in the soap is made from sugar cane. Is this true?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," the prince leaned back in his chair. "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that sugar cane expensive?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No...just an ordinary crop."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard people say that in the king's thumb size A bottle of perfume can sell five golden dragons," Carter scratched his head. "If this is the case, can it be used to make perfumes from sugar cane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five Golden Dragons?" Roland groaned, but he did not consider this. Recalling the time when I was in the palace, the four princes never cared about the price of a daily necessities. This is especially true for perfumes that are less in contact with them - only women prefer these things that make them full of fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial motivation for his perfume was just to get a soap. Otherwise, there is tap water, and the bathroom without soap always feels something less, so that the bubble is full of body is the romance of the bathroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
