			<div id="content"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system of rotation is not a problem for villages or small towns with small population density, but the land around the big cities is tense, and in this way it is a waste of land. . Places like Silver City, Falling Dragon Ridge and Wangdu import large quantities of food from other towns every month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in using human and animal fat is to collect them first. This is why Roland decided to establish a public toilet as soon as possible. At the same time, it can also reduce the spread of disease and beautify the living environment. It is a multi-pronged measure. After the remaining batches of personnel were shipped, the toilet was almost completed. As for how to compost, how to cultivate the land, he decided to choose a group of experienced old farmers to teach separately in a few days. After all, the land is still in the leveling stage, and it will take at least a week to start farming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finishing the work at hand, he decided to go to the back garden to see the experimental field of the leaves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the leaves have been studied for various types of seed improvement, all the places in the garden where flowers can be planted have been planted. She also divided the flower pond into a number of blocks and numbered them according to Roland's suggestion, and compared the developmental results of the two experimental crops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland just stepped into the yard and was blinded by a golden wheat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness." When I saw the prince, the leaves on the edge of the flower pond rose up and gathered around the hair of the ear, and marched to the court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the result of your improvement?" He waved his hand and motioned that the other party did not have to pay more, and walked over and excitedly picked up a heavy wheat ear. Feel the plump of its fullness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no idea what the wheat can look like, but compared to the memory of the king’s wheat field in childhood, those wheat ears are not only smaller than the ones in his hands. And the particles are also a lot of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves nodded, "I will make the wheat ears bigger, ripen the seeds, and then plant the new seeds into the flower pond, you can get such wheat." Spike. But... Repeat this process. After two or three rounds of sowing, it is difficult to grow large and long ears of wheat. I don't know why."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I can't help in this regard, Roland thought. According to his poor and poor junior high school biology knowledge, probably because of self-contained defects? Rice is grown in the south, and it is far from wheat. In order to increase production, seeds are also bought. However, it can be used for two generations. A wheat can produce more than 130 seeds. The first seeds are modified by leaves. Then the farmers can make their own seeds. You can at least use them. Two years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This piece, why is it empty?" Roland noticed a flower bed with only a few dry straws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beginning I was planting there, maybe because I planted it too many times," the leaves were unsure. "I can still use wheat if I cast magic." Growing fast, but after removing the magic, they will quickly wither."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the magically transformed plants continue to grow and still need land for nutrients, some trace elements Still essential. Roland walked to the last flower bed. The shape of the wheat planted here was very strange. There were several clusters of blue wheat ears hanging on the straw of one arm, and several branches were stretched in the center of the stalk. The branches were covered with green leaves. Therefore, the size of each wheat is also relatively large, and only two plants are planted in the flower beds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the magic version of Roland’s trial of the leaves - the wheat tree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He envisioned the direction of making wheat like a banana tree, producing fruit from the branches, harvesting it regularly every year, thus eliminating the trouble of planting the fields. At the same time, grow more and more green leaves, improve photosynthesis and reduce the demand for land. At present, the thick wheat straw and branches are slightly occupied, and only the wheat growing from the branches does not conform to the original idea. Or, let the leaves try to improve towards the vines? Roland thought, after all, she had never seen a real banana tree, and the grape was not a rare product in the Grey Fort. If there is a contrast, it should be easier to imitate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seeds of these three wheats cannot be used for sowing," said the leaf. "I tried, and the wheat seeds could not germinate after they went down. But it does Repeated results, the wheat you see is already in the second batch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to germinate means that each wheat tree is unique and needs leaves Personally modified, the current planting value is not large. "You have done a very good job. The variety of the barley ear is called the gold one. I will leave a test field on the south bank of the Chishui River for you. I will cover it with fences and partitions. You will ripen a batch of gold one as soon as possible. No., used for spring planting this year.” Roland said, “As for the garden, I will continue to use it to improve new varieties. I just came up with a lot of ideas. Not only the wheat crop, but also the grapes are worth trying.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
