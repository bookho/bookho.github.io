			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Queue in disembark, don't push!" The Grey Fortress in black uniform shouted as he shuttled through the crowd. "Look at your number plate, After disembarking, look for the corresponding inspection port, don't go in the wrong direction!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred, who has not recovered from the shock, is being pushed like this Squeezed and boarded the long-lost deck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panoramic view of the busy port is in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is definitely the largest harbor he has ever seen, and the long docks continue to extend along the coast, and you can't see the end. Unlike the impression of the wet and decaying port of the past, the ground is covered with a layer of white masonry that looks neat and clean. Ships of all sizes are constantly coming and going, even if the busiest harbour in the morning kingdom cannot be compared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should be a very spectacular sight, and it can be seen from the amazing tone of the surrounding people, but for him, it’s only quite wrong. In the chaotic mind, add a less critical one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred looked almost in a three-step look toward the direction of the ship, hoping to see the figure again - this is almost A physical instinctive reaction is like seeking evidence and comfort to show that you are not in a delusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, until the embarkation of the trestle, those ridiculous things have never appeared again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sense of loss in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please take out your number plate and enter the respective checkpoints against the first three digits!" Many people on the docks hold strange metal access Shouting, that thing seems to have the ability to amplify the sound, and its words can be heard clearly even in the noisy crowd. "After listening to the instructions of the receiver, complete the immigration check. Welcome to the Grey Fortress, welcome to become One of us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manfred shook his head hard, forcing a happy distraction and focusing his attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a strange way to meet – he can’t help but think that everyone here knows that they are not actively moving to the Grey Fort, and the Grey Fort is in the wolf heart. Everything that was done was also mandatory, but now listening to the other person’s words still makes him feel a little peace of mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The towering rock wall suddenly collapsed here, forming a natural checkpoint, a densely migrating line of people, and the scores slowly passed through the inspection port. The crowds gathered on the docks alone, the number has exceeded 10,000, and the migrants obviously not only come from a wolf heart... can mobilize so many people in a short period of time and project the will of the rulers to the other three kingdoms. This is probably the best portrayal of the strength of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the team stopped moving forward, and Manfred heard a sigh of relief behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than just outsiders, even the black people who maintain order are surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went back and found that a huge sailless sea boat was slowly entering the port - it had a slender body, and the whole body seemed to be made of metal. Into, the exposed bright wheels are not visible on both sides, and the towering and straight dry strings are very powerful. No matter where it is, such a ship must be the focus of attention. However, it is obvious that what really surprised the Grey Fort is not the big ship itself, but its state...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This group of people is crazy, actually put iron Take the shipbuilding!" Someone whispered around. "Don't they know that the iron will rust when it meets the water?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe the king of the gray castle just wants Show off my family's bottom... But the iron boat is really prestige. Before I saw the stone boat, I don't know that such a heavy thing can float on the water."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "What is the use of the prestige for ten days and a half? I used to run much at sea. I have never seen anything. The erosion ability of salt water is much more serious than you think. The general paint can't be protected for a long time. You see, this is the end of the chaos."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the steel ship is full of black and brown rust spots, the surface should be slick, damage marks It is very glaring, and it is in stark contrast to the white pier. The mast on the top of the head was even folded into several sections and was scattered on the front deck. Plus the slow movements when it is docked, it is like a sea beast that has entered the coveted years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
