			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-level witch’s worries and doubts only lasted for a day or so, and the news from subsequent follow-ups was completely dispelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that Felice said is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third side of the city is completely boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, even if Elsie is reluctant, he is unable to stop everyone’s yearning for the dream world. At this step, what should Tachella do? It is already obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa conducted a talk about the covenant with Roland through the illusion instrument. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demon sorcerer who stayed at the bottom of the earth walked through the light curtain in turn, and gave the king of the Grey City, the king of the Grey Fort, the elbow to press the chest, acknowledging him. The only leader for the united front. Then came the high-level witches who turned into the original carrier, and they hanged the Lord's must to him to show loyalty - this is the courtesy that only the three seats of the federation can get, it represents the time after more than four hundred years, Takira There is a mortal ruler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last one of Elsie appeared in front of the light curtain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 20-year-old who joined the Supreme Legion, in order to defend the glory of Takira, and the high-level promotion of the devil's bloody battle for more than ten years, Pasha Always worried about what she would do. But in the end, she put the battle of the gods and the expectations of her companions in the first place, and bent the main must to Roland. Regardless of how reluctant her heart is at the moment, Pasha is still gratified by the decision of the overall situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an incredible scene in the era of Tacharia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the long time of more than four hundred years is enough to change many things, and the ambition and firm belief that "all human beings will defeat the devil under the leadership of the witch" is Gradually, the corners were worn away. When a mortal showed his amazing potential and had the salvation of Tacula survivors, some meaningless insistence was obviously less important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Pasha believes that the three seats of the Federation agree that the witch will eventually stand out from the human group, and mortals like Roland will only be a minority, the witch always One day I can return to the position of the leader. However, by then, the relationship between the two must be much more harmonious than the Takilla era. After all, if you can survive the third battle of the gods, the idea that the witch and the mortal can work together to exert the greatest strength will undoubtedly be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't mind seeing a future like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland actually implemented his looting plan, it was three days later . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that he would not be found by Jieluo, he rented a warehouse near the tower to serve as a temporary "landing point" for the witch to connect to the dream. . As long as the witch is assembled here before he breaks the dream, he will still appear in the warehouse the next time he enters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the first connection will inevitably appear in the apartment building No. 0825 of the Bozi Building... For this point, Roland is also puzzling, probably because of the reason of Jieluo. This led to the house becoming a key node connecting the outside world with the dream. Therefore, whenever he enters a new person, he must count the time and wait until Jie Luo goes out to school to let the witch connect to the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these three days, Roland selected four goddess witches, including Felice, as the first pioneers. In the first two days, he could buy some fast food and drinks to satisfy their extremely strong desire to eat and drink. On the third day, they could only buy instant noodles and mineral water. But even so, they still ate with relish, and looked at the situation, but did not turn over the seasoning package and smash it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they did not come up with such an idea, but Roland stopped them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise it would be too much to lose the face of the united front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the growing savings, the plan has reached the moment of having to act. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When night falls, Roland tells Jielu that he will return home after the night, taking four taxis, one after the other, one after the other. The villa area outside the Third Ring Road goes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
