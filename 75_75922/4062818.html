			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom...the civilization? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but think of the ramps in the North Slope mine, and the caves that the nightingale said through the desperate mountains... In his memory, there is no What geological movements can create such a strange landform. At first he thought it was caused by a mixture of mutated beasts. Now, are they all traces of underground civilization? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people at the time didn't realize this at all, and there was no plan to communicate. The form between the two is far apart. We even treated each other as A new devil, so the history of the record left a great deviation, until the end of the second war of the gods has a breakthrough discovery." Pasha's voice seems a bit low, "At that time, the three major There is only one tower in the holy city, and the federation has reached a critical moment in life and death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What does a breakthrough discovery mean?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Quest will figure out the way to store the soul from their remaining slate paintings, and verify this possibility on an un-incubated initial carrier. Since then, three The seat opened the study of the transformation of the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know about it at all..." Aegusa was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The soul transfer is the highest secret of the federation, even two levels higher than the gods' penalty plan that used the witch as a test material. At that time there were only three The seat and a few high-level executives know," Passa replied. "We also learned this amazing news after the fall of Takira."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So at the beginning Is Nataya supporting the plan of the gods?” Roland frowned and asked, “What is the original carrier?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Because she has no choice. As for the latter . . . is what we are today.” Her tentacles fell down and the body was closer to the light curtain. “This ugly and weird body is evidence of the existence of underground civilization and the only tombstone they have left behind. This is A long story, sire, please listen to me slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland nodded and poured himself a chaotic drink, lying on the chair, Feel the constant awareness of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "According to the tips on the slate paintings, the disappearing civilization left a city in the mountains of the desperate mountains. The Quest will find nothing for a long time, and then it will be shocked. Since the habits are underground, will the city be built underground?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the search was expanded, the witches finally found this grandeur. The city - it consists of four floors, half the size of the Takira, each with countless ramps and voids, complex as a maze. If there is no witch who can sense the position as a guide, once caught It is difficult to come out. Therefore, the Quest will also call it the maze relic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Unfortunately, before they can explore it carefully, Takira will fall into the hands of the devil. Everyone had no choice but to embark on a journey of escape. After paying a heavy price, we finally reached the maze. According to the plan, the federation took the original carrier stored in the maze and then went to the Hermes Plateau to establish a new holy. City, on the east coast of the mainland Unrequitedly recasting a new order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "However, what happens next can't be expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Tell here, Pasha is silent, his scales are dull, even if he can't see his expression, Roland can feel the sadness in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, she went on to say, "In the process of stopping, the Quest will find that the remains of the maze are well preserved, even if it is a brand new city. In addition to the existence of the original carrier, there are many incredible secrets hidden in the bottom of the remains. The three most important discoveries are the magic core, the central carrier and the record of the disappearing civilization. Later we realized that it was the first. In the second battle of the gods, it wanted to lead us here.” Pasha took a deep breath, “The maze remains are prepared for us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why?" Tilly couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For revenge," another voice rang in the minds of the people. Her voice was much colder than Pasha. "It wants us to destroy the devil." To report the genocide of their ethnic group."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
