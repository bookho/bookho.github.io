			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo Stoll walks into the alchemy workshop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chief instructor," Apprentices saw Caimo bowing their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hand, "You continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentices are squatting again, busy Live in your own hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outermost part of the workshop is the washing room. The materials from all over the gray castle are cleaned, sorted, screened and ground. The design of the washing room is also very clever. The slate floor is laid on a small stream, which is used for passage in the middle. It is surrounded by a stream of water, running parallel to the stone road, crossing a wide-armed stream, and the outermost part is the cleaning area. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, the narrow sorting room is divided into three sections by the longitudinal direction of the two streams. Light shines through the holes in the windows on both sides of the wall, reflecting the slate ground and the stream of water, forming a long strip of light across the room. Light and dark overlap each other, like a snake's markings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly a hundred apprentices rely on the wall to process the materials assigned to them. If the removed debris is lighter than water, it can be thrown directly into the stream. If it is heavier than water, it should be packed into the basket, brought out of the washing room and discarded. If you use living water for cleaning, the effect is much better than the stagnant water in the barrel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will study here for three to five years, until they are well aware of the sorting and cleaning of all kinds of materials, and have the opportunity to be selected as disciples by the instructors. one room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo walks through the light and dark spots and walks into the core area of ​​the alchemy workshop - the refining room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening the door, the line of sight became suddenly clear, and twelve giant trees from the fascinating forest were used as pillars to prop up this extremely spacious room. The four stone walls are all covered with windows, and even the roof is covered with a patio and shelter, making the room very light. There are six wide wooden tables in the center of the refining room. The table is full of all kinds of alchemy equipment: round bottom bottles, glass cups, balances, medicine pots, stoves, pots... each instructor manages and uses one The table, and he is the chief alchemist of Chishui City, the naturalest is the longest, and the table with the most equipment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is always full of clutter and disorder, just like alchemy, mixing all kinds of raw materials together, heating, retorting, passing water, burning. Its results are always ever-changing and fascinating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can find a clear direction from these disorderly changes, writing a text is an extremely rare alchemy formula. Anyone who can create an alchemy formula can be called an alchemist. So far, he has summed up more than a dozen alchemy formulas, each of which seems to be a whisper from the gods - Kaimo believes that alchemy develops to a certain extent, not only can separate the source, but can even combine everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chames, how is your snow powder copied?" he asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man in his twenties walked over and shook his head. "This damn king alchemist must have added other ingredients to it." The powder is very finely ground, and there is really no useful thing to separate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the youngest alchemist in the alchemy workshop - in general, think To create an alchemy formula, it is impossible to do without long accumulation and trial, and sometimes even a little luck. Many people in the workshop have been a disciple for a lifetime, and it is difficult to further the death. Chamez has an extraordinary talent for alchemy. Two years ago, he summed up the practice of retorting green scorpion to obtain acid, which won the unanimous approval of five alchemists. From then on, there was a long table in the refining room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t worry, take your time." He smiled and patted each other's shoulders to show comfort. After eight years as the chief, Kemer naturally understands the difficulty of finding truth from disorder and chaos. "But I did make a good thing last night. I can give those proud guys a look. Come with me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked to his desk and let the two disciples move to the storage box - the box is about half a person tall, and the whole body is made of wrought iron. It is not easy to be stolen and it is difficult to be destroyed. He took out the key and opened the first floor of the grid, with a small transparent crystal lying in the center of the grid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cut-cut crystal?" Chamez stood aside and carefully pinched it in his hand, looking out at the sunlight outside the window. "No, this. Yes...crystal glass! God! You did it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
