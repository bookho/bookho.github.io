			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of the spindle-shaped skeleton swells exponentially, and the purple radiance flows over it, making the floor of the hall stained with a cool color. Then the two-meter-high behemoth slowly rotates, with the flickering fluorescence, which is as beautiful as the neon lanterns of later generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those skeletons that are open out of the air tell Roland that the magic really exceeds the scope of "physics" to some extent. There are no fulcrums, but they can be separated, as if there are a pair of invisible hands involved in them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did the underground civilization make these things?" He looked at Pasha. "If you give the materials, you can make a copy." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid I can't do it now, squat," Pasha shook her head. "Although I don't want to admit it, this group's research on magic is far more advanced than the Federation. Celine is already a leader in the Quest, and she has only learned how to operate them for hundreds of years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lack of manpower is also a major problem," said Celine Passing over, "Analyze its structure is no less than instilling magic. - You must feel thousands of contacts at the same time, in order to see the whole picture roughly, and the skin of ordinary people can't do this at all."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In other words, if you want to understand it, you must become what you are now?" Tilly asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it’s like the summer worm doesn't know the cold of winter, the scorpion can't hear the sound of everything." Celine was quite helpless, "I even I can't describe what I feel in human language - because there is no similar expression in the existing vocabulary. So now only I and Pasha can control the magic core."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait... What do you mean, the original seemingly rough master on the carrier is actually very sensitive?" Roland was surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not just the Lord’s, but every touch,” says Serin. “They can distinguish between hot and cold, smell, wet and dry... And the slightest touch to the extreme, the Lord must even feel the flow of magic directly. So once transferred to the carrier, you can no longer adapt to the past body. How, are you interested in it?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I just ask casually..." Roland involuntarily opened his eyes. At this critical time, don't think about it anymore. The Lord must be sensitive again, and it is also a powerful weapon of the original carrier. He remembers that Felice said that the power itself is not weaker than the god witch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it can be seen that as an ordinary person wants to study the magic, there is an almost insurmountable scorpio in itself - even the perception can not do, and how to go Study it? This is destined to be a discipline that belongs to only a few people before reliable observations are obtained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The third core has been adjusted to the soul instrument mode, the transfer is about to begin," Celine's voice interrupted his thoughts, with this reminder, Pa Sha and Els also inserted the main must into the spindle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland's eyes widened, for fear of missing a detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in fact, this process does not have any singularities, only two rays of light emerge from the core, covering the two stone beds below, At the same time, the magic filled in the skeleton quickly surged. In half a quarter of an hour, Celine grew a sigh of relief. "Good luck, this guy can indeed be captured by the soul instrument. Now I just wait for it to attach to the god warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is over?" He blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, soul transfer is a process of exchanging keys," Pasha explained. "If you look through the colorful magic stone, you will see that it belongs to The light column of the devil has been taken away from the gods."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the ancient witch has not yet fallen, and the original warrior who was still motionless suddenly opened Eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facial features on his face are wrinkled into a group, which is extraordinarily embarrassing, not only the strange noise in the throat, but also the body shaking, the fingers are like dead wood The general bends in several directions - this strange scene makes the onlookers can't help but take a step back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
