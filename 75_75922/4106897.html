			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked at his own ideas and looked at each other. "Do you really think that letting Count Quinn manage the morning is worse than a gorgeous neighbor?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of questioning, Isis did not reveal the slightest surprise. "In fact, I think the two are comparable in the short term, a stable Your allies can provide you with resources, demographics, and actions to assist you in the Battle of God - this may be variable for other nobles, but Count Quinn has the ring of Andrea as a guarantee. There are still some points to grasp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She... admitted this? This made Roland somewhat unintelligible. He thought that the opponentâ€™s rebuttal would be in the untrustworthy of the nobility. In addition, what is the short-term meaning of her mouth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reversely, after the morning sun is in chaos, the new order needs blood to recast, and this period will definitely lead to the weakening of the kingdom. If coupled with the devil invasion, neighbors The country will become like the east and south of the gray fort, and the refugees will be everywhere, and there will be a lot of people. At that time, with a little arrangement, the gray castle will get a large population - unlike the previous one, these people will always belong to you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you just said that allies, apart from the population, can provide resources and war assistance?" The nightingale is not pleasing, "not to mention a benefit first." Why are you equal to the three benefits? Have you never thought about how many people in the migration process will die helplessly because of lack of clothes and short food?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis is opposite: "The three benefits seem to be more than one benefit, but there are preconditions. In order to make full use of the resources of allies, you need to invest a certain amount of chips - such as steam engines, gold No. 2, even gunpowder firearms. If there is no such thing, relying on the morning It is impossible for the strength of the body to confront the devil, let alone support the gray fort on the battlefield. This is a huge expenditure, although it can be exchanged for more benefits, but in the absence of winter city's own demand has not been met. Underneath, the weight of the chips can't be ignored. Therefore, under the increase and decrease, I think the two are basically equal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can't help picking an eyebrow, can provide from The people who saw the benefits in aid were already rare in the entire Grey Fort. If he changed to Barov, he would not agree to ship his goods and technology as "support items" to neighboring countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the benefits are basically equal, why do you still insist on the chaotic morning?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because the witch, Your Majesty." Itis's answer was beyond the expectations of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Female...Witch?" Roland said differently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northland Pearl sticks out a finger, "Yes, please imagine that the new dawn is no longer a matter of persecution of the witch, even by the security With the influence of Delia, Count Quinn is very likely to support witches and follow your policies and involve them in production and construction. Without the pressure of survival, the newly awakened witch will not migrate to the Grey Fort. This has already caused you a loss - this is one of them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second, the location of the Dawn Kingdom is more advantageous than the Grey Fort, no matter The devil invades the wolf heart and the winter, or the church fugitives are not dead, will push the witches of the two countries to the south - once the morning sun is in a stable state, will they continue to migrate to the gray fort? The answer is obviously not, maybe Ten years later, the witches in neighboring countries will surpass the gray fort. Compared with the former, this trend makes me feel more uneasy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone can live well ... Isn't this bad? What are you upset?" The tone of the nightingale is unknown. I did not sleep in the previous remarks of momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis did not look at the nightingale, but raised his head and looked straight at Roland. "Have you ever thought about a possibility, one or several witches with incredible ability?" Can you instantly change the gap between the kingdom and the kingdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about Anna?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, like Anna, like Aisha, like Soroya... Their abilities can be called incredible. When you have them, no winter city is opened with other nobles. The gap, this is why you can go to this step today." Itis slowly said, "In addition, you have no knowledge or vision, as long as you are still in place, members of the Witch Alliance A lot, the Grey Fort is difficult to meet challengers other than the devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
