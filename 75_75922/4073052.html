			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last day of the Winter Festival, the mixed expedition team composed of no winter city and Taqila remnants finally set off for the west of the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland stood at the dockside and watched the concrete boat carrying the people slowly leaving the dock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This visit can be regarded as the most complicated action in history. The First Army, the Witch Alliance and the Taqila Witch will cooperate with each other. Snow mountain. If all goes well, they will arrive at the source of the Chishui River three days later and then choose a leeward port to tie down the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the pioneers will use Maggie’s magical Ark to find the location of the ruins, and then control the worms that devour the worms to open a passage on the mountain wall for Large units entered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program is like a jewel in the gold school to sneak into the graves left by the ancestors. For the civilization relics that may exist in the snowy mountains, Roland is curious. Itchy in my heart. It is a pity that after the last experience of being thrown by the devil's spear, Wendy and the book did not agree to the idea of ​​going with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this does not mean that the expedition team will lower the level of alert - considering that there may be invisible evils that have appeared in the lost forest near the snowy mountains. The beast, Roland sent the nightingale out. After all, if the team drags on for a long time, Sylvie can't do it alone, especially if it needs to be split. Takira also took out the last three colorful magic stones to detect any magical unit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Pasha, as long as there is magic, there will be a beam of light on the top of the head. The devil and the mixed species are no exception, but their beams are especially small. It’s gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifty-five goddess witches, five hundred first-class soldiers, plus a large number of high-level awakened, this power is absolutely invincible on the mainland That kind. If everyone can return smoothly in this operation, it will undoubtedly lay the foundation for future mixed operations between ordinary people, extraordinary soldiers and all kinds of witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's go back," Roland touched the snow on his nose and said to Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the latter looked up and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time to stay in the night, the task of guarding the king was handed over to Anna - but for the two who are already very familiar with each other, staying at the moment There is no discomfort in the personal protection, but it is quite a natural thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland pulled her hand and walked toward the castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he entered the hall, he accidentally saw the figure of Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't follow them to the Big Snow Mountain?" Roland asked with an eyebrow. "I thought you would be more interested in exploring the remains of the underground." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are right, but Pasha wants me to stay." Felice shrugged. "I am most familiar with the castle. Your men are also right." I have a basic impression that since I am working as a protection worker, I am indeed the most suitable candidate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving a godly witch to guard the castle is Takira The requirements put forward by the side - Anna's ability is powerful, but it does not play a role in the face of the stone of God's punishment. At the same time, her fighting talent is far from her ability to learn. Once she loses her ability, both people may be in danger. in. With this in mind, Pasha insisted on arranging a godly witch as a front-line protector. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can control the enchanted field in fact, they are almost any witch's nemesis, and the body that is not afflicted with pain can fight under extremely harsh conditions, even if the enemy is Extraordinary, the god of punishment does not fall into the wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So trouble you," Roland habitually replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what I should do." She nodded. "In general, I will stay in the hall. If there is an accident, I will do my best." I arrived at you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that the other party is doing this to avoid suspicion, the first floor to the office has sufficient buffer space, so that the protector and the There is a delicate balance between protectors. If the Takira side insists on arranging the guards into the office, even if its purpose is really for his safety, it will only increase the unhappiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
