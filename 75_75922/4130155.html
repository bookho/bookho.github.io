			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the training room, the pedestrian headed south along the cement road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road is full of new red brick houses, both newly built and under construction - according to Finkin, this is only a year ago. A wasteland near the sea, with nothing but a few lonely trunks. But now, the construction team has turned this into a "city in the city." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a wall - although not high, it is enough to separate the ground from the outside world, and the warning sign on the wall is "No overturning, offenders" Killing can also let those good people dispel the idea of ​​sneaking in and out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are houses, canteens, playgrounds, training rooms, classrooms, etc. in the walls... and there is more than one place. It took a whole day for Goode to understand the meaning of these quirky words. Simply put, eating and drinking can be done in the wall. The closed management that the instructor said is probably also the meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is that this place is particularly large - here for a few weeks, he has not seen where the corner of the wall is. Of course, this is also related to the limited scope of the student's activities. Without special permission, they can only travel to and from the dormitory and playground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all of this comes out in a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Goode who moved to the West in the winter, although it is often heard that no winter city is famous for its amazing construction speed, there is no intuitive Feel. It was not until he entered this "city in the city" that he understood what it was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a week ago, the southern end of the playground was empty, and now it has covered a red cottage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other cities, this efficiency can be described as incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the playground wall, there was a discussion in the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where they are usually forbidden to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today’s talents are able to see the whole picture of the place – it’s an extremely open flat, with no obscurity in sight, azure blue sky and clouds occupying More than half of the field of vision, and farther away is the boundless sea of ​​vortex. The chilly sea breeze rushed to the face, so that Goode’s mood suddenly rose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to say that when I used to see the red brick forest in front, I suddenly saw such a scene and felt that the whole world was relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Strange... I thought there would be something wrong with this," Heinz whispered. "Isn't it just a block of land?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the open space, except for a few black stone pavements that run through the east and look like the main street without the winter city, there is no other conspicuous Building it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really a bit confusing to classify it as a restricted area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe it is worried that the scenery here is too good, I am afraid that we will fall into the sea and fall into the sea." Finkin snorted. "But I think, if it is Move the classroom here, and my enthusiasm for learning must be at least 30%."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean zero multiplied by three is still equal to zero?" Someone laughed at the side . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, are you challenging me?" Fingin blinked back. "Is it better than the score?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't say this, you see there," Goode raised an eyebrow. "There have been people who have arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's the other class..." Heinz's words made the whole team quietly quiet. Although they have not been in direct contact with each other, they have not heard from the instructor how good the other is. What day to complete all the exercises, and at the same time, they also ask for more practice, and what is spit on them is still not enough to swivel chair... In short, They are both determined and hardworking, and they are like a group of fools who have wasted their talents. The cognac is half the difference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also makes them subconsciously see each other as an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
