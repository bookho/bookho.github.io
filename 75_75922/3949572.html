			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no swaying candlelight, no burning fire, Under the effect of the heating, even the single clothes in the room are warm and pleasant, and the luminous stones on the bedside table are brightly lit indoors - a stable and gentle yellow light is reflected on the bed and the carpet, adding to the scene in front of the scene. A wonderful sense of the times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sat on the edge of the bed and listened to the slight snoring from the heating pipe. There was always a feeling like a dream, as if it was neither here. The backward era of the kingship is not a modern society where electronic products are everywhere, but a childhood between the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impression of that era is like the scene at this time, everywhere is covered by dim, whether it is incandescent, movie, or washed out photos, all Filled with the same color. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is no Anna in this part of the memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but look at the girl sitting on the bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is looking at the story book in her hand, the hair falling from the front of the forehead shines with golden light, and the long eyelashes occasionally shake twice, making it look very smart. The most striking thing is still her sapphire eyes. Even in the reflection of the magic stone, it is still a clear lake blue. If there is any difference, then the lake is no longer as it used to be. Waves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She makes the whole picture vivid, and Roland can’t help but think that Anna is a completely different color in the scene, and a mark that distinguishes between memory and reality. See her I will realize that all this is true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you looking at?" I don’t know when the prince found that the other person had put down the book of magic and looked down at himself, "I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough..." He subconsciously removed his gaze, but quickly moved back. "Well...nothing."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly a year of getting along, the two are very familiar with each other, Roland’s mentality is no longer as passive as it was at the beginning, plus only two of them in the room tonight, he also relaxes The emotion that has been converging. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two looked at each other for a while and laughed at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You said, will my request be somewhat self-willed?" Anna shook her head with a smile. "Everyone cares about me, but I reject them." Outside the door."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are too serious," Roland said. "They just looked a little surprised at the time."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Miss Gesha does not say those "ancient methods", I will not mention this request," she vomited her tongue - such a playful expression in Anna It's rarely seen in the body. "But other sisters will follow suit, and you will be busy." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland reluctantly smiled. "I guess their request is to eat a few more ice cream buns." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After learning that Anna is about to pass the Awakening Day, Ai Gesha immediately contributed her experience in the holy city of Taqila - according to the Federation study, When the witch is awakened or adult, in addition to the need to empty the body's magic and reduce the impact of anti-phasic, personal emotions are also very important. Positive attitudes such as joy and satisfaction can greatly enhance their own resistance, so for some outstanding witches, the federation Even in their adulthood, they will send special personnel to meet their requirements.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after Anna knew the matter, the request was to let Roland accompany him to spend the awakening Day.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Together’s blessing, I feel very happy now,” she said calmly. “You can’t wait to see you in adulthood. This regret can finally be made up. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a serious look, Rao is a little embarrassed, he cleared his throat and took out a satin from behind. The thin book with the hand was delivered to Anna. "This is awakening day gift. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rewriting the knowledge of calculus in higher mathematics in order to catch up with this day - for witches, the importance of Awakening Day is more important than birthday For the sake of importance, it can be called a second new life. Roland used to feel embarrassed about what gifts to give during the holiday season. Until now, there is still no progress. Under the meditation, he decided to give new knowledge as a gift. The other side - Anna's own learning talent is excellent, but also interested in these, how is not a bad choice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
