			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Booming and rumble ——————————!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The electric light flashed in the vortex formed by the dark clouds, and gradually moved closer to the center; the heavy rain poured down the earth under the sweep of the wind, and a layer of rain and fog was stirred up in the forest. The newly-deviled Maharaja and the superb are closely attached to each other, just like two statues that blend together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turbulent magic has completely surrounded the ashes, and there is even a golden stream of light around her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the goal of God's aim -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sees herself as a sharp knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this your last struggle?" Erskuk yelled. "It’s stupid to want to go with me in this way!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I won't... let go," Ash said hard. When the half of the chest and lungs were worn, she even became difficult to breathe. The blood was back flowing into the air intake tube, and the nose and mouth were full of salty rust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes... She keeps telling herself that it only takes five minutes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party does not open the gap with her strength. As long as she does not loose her hands, it is basically impossible to break free from her bondage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think that I will use strength to win the game with you?" The face of Erskuk looked even more awkward under the rain, "seemingly You have forbidden me, but in fact this is just the cage you built for yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few black lights stick out from its chest, it is like a tentacle Generally penetrated into the ash body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that there would be no more painful feelings than magic, but the pain caused by black light is several times higher than burning the body! It is as if there are countless fine needles that are stuck into the brain along the blood vessels. If you have not repeatedly told yourself before, you can't lose consciousness anyway. At this moment, I am afraid that she has already fallen into a fainting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the unbearable pain is just the beginning - the black lines start from the piercing site, spread a little bit around, the skin wherever you go Slightly bulging, as if something crawled in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey coughed up a blood, "You...cough...what did you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "A small gift is also a proof of the magical understanding and control of the gap between you and me." Erskuk is close to the ashes. "To be honest, I should thank you. If it weren't for this battle, I wouldn't be able to do this." Welcome to promote. Now, you have sent yourself to me - I am looking forward to what I can improve after you completely defeat you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ember suddenly realized that this is another form of erosion, the part covered by the black lines completely lost the perception, just like it does not belong to her. She bit her lip and tried to run the magic of her body. She didn't want to erode back like an enemy. She only hoped to stop the invasion of the other side's magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You... I want to control me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two magical forces under the violent impact, Sluk's look was also distorted, and his newly acquired body suddenly expanded, and its volume quickly surpassed itself, turning into a bloated and unsightly sarcoma – like the body of a half-hell lord and it. Forced together, it looks extraordinarily deformed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even if the erosion is only paused for a little while, the speed of black-streak expansion, although slightly slowed, can still move forward a little bit. Some of them have climbed the neck of the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s worthy of perseverance." Erskuk smiled cruelly, and at this moment it has been judged by the previous appearance - alienated The body not only distorts the face of the devil, but also makes it lose the contour of the human figure. From which point of view it is no different from the monster. "But what is the use?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...will not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The severe pain hurts the ashes of the mind, and she opened her mouth, but she couldn't make a sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vortex of the top of the head has been formed, the golden light shines, but she feels that the power is getting farther and farther away from herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter the tolerance of the magic, or the long life required to adapt to the magic, we are all above you, such a gap is like a bird and a worm No matter how you struggle, you can't make up for this gap! Two battles of divineness have proved this!" Erskuk slowly lifted her up, as if she was arguing that her final outcome was high. So peace of mind to die here, you must blame you for being born into a weak human -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not - look down - human !"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly there was a clear cry in the rain. This sound is very familiar, and the ash is restored to a bit clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She barely looked around and saw Lin Xing rushing out of an electric figure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes...Lightning? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw the other side dragging a long mist mark in the rain curtain, passing over the darkened trunks and rushing straight toward Ersruk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what she seems to hold in her arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grayed the blink of an eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was... three grenades? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bug, you are looking for death!" Erskuk started the field of forbidden magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when black light is about to touch with lightning, the latter looses his hands and changes the direction of his flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is separated from the grenade-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of lack of ability, inertia still exists, After leaving the embrace of lightning, the grenade opened its tail and flew to Ursuk with unrelenting speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You-!" The devil's tyrant smashed his teeth, causing all the magic to erect a blue barrier in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the three flames of flowers bloom outside the barrier, but that is only a prelude to destruction. The hot and arrogant energy is gathered into a dazzling jet by a conical bullet, which hits the barrier straight and makes it break like a glass. After penetrating this defense, the jet cut the body of the Ersruk mutation like a hot knife and cut the butter, and the sarcoma dragged behind it was twisted into a mud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the magic stone that was obtained from the high-level devil was also completely shattered by this shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esruck screamed up! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spread of black lines suddenly shrank back, the ash felt the pain suddenly disappeared, and consciousness returned to the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not hesitate to launch the long-awaited look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party also realized that the situation was not good, and he screamed that he wanted to open the witch in front of him, and the ashes clasped his hands in the hands of Erskuk, naturally he would not give It's this opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are right, humans are really weak... but even so, we want to continue on this road, no matter what challenges ahead." "We won't back down." She paused, revealing a smile. "Because someone is standing in front and pointing out the direction for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The golden thunder of the sky is running through the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the glory of the near-white, Erskuk was completely evaporated, and there was no trace of existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roaring thunder echoes over the fertile plains and has not dissipated for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the gods were extinguished, there was only one ash on the empty ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
