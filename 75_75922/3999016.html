			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say!?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord of the Night City, Calvin Kant, the Duke of the North, stood up in disbelief and looked at the messenger in front of him. The cup on the table knocked over to the ground and made a crisp crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Duke of the Duke, this is what I saw with my own eyes!" The latter's head was buried a little lower. "The rebel king broke the king in only one day." The walls of the city, the King’s Majesty did not escape, and now I’m afraid it’s too much!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“This...how is it possible?” Calvin muttered "That's the king!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-foot high bluestone wall, the guards of thousands of people, the ripper and the snow powder, no two The team of 30,000 people, do not want to cross this line of defense. And even if the four princes can gather so many people, they should not attack the kings within one day! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They...they are too powerful," the messenger’s voice trembled a little, not knowing whether the physical strength caused by the overnight journey was weak or was witnessed by himself. Everything is shocking. "Not only can it be launched continuously, but the power is still amazing. Don't talk about the Cavaliers. Even the King's mad Guards can't stop them from advancing. Just squatting, even if you don't die, you basically go half a life... In contrast, the firearms under the arm are generally no different from the fire sticks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calvin has a blank space in his mind, only one thought in his heart, finished, everything It’s over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving a new king’s order more than a week ago, he was asked to send a unit to support Wang Du. As the newly-registered Duke of the North, he naturally had to make Respond. After some deliberation, Calvin finally transferred a team of 2,500 people from Matthews, Snowfox Lista and his family, and waited until after the snow, and started to work as a king - although it is expected to arrive and ask for help. It’s almost half a month apart, but considering that the siege warfare often lasts for months, it’s not too late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the spring ploughing is about to begin, there are not many serfs in the ranks, and there are very few knights. Most of them are mercenaries and freemen, but in any case, as long as they send out teams, In the eyes of the rebel, he must be guilty of sin, and his good days will soon come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, and Itis! Calvin suddenly remembered his baby daughter. If it was her, maybe she could figure out what to save. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on, call the eldest daughter to my room!" he shouted at the guards around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly, Itis, who was wearing a casual dress, walked into the study, and she was still wearing a training sword on her side. Her hair was on her head and her nose. Fine sweat on the body. Apparently she is practicing swordsmanship as usual, with a hint of indifference on her face. "Did I say it? Don't bother me when practicing the sword."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" This time is different, the family has to face a big problem!” Calvin eagerly repeated the news of the messenger back. “What should we do now?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He looked at his daughter eagerly, hoping she could give a solution - if the Northland is rich in pearls, then Itis Kant is the brightest one. She is not only beautiful, but also very talented. Both political affairs and marching operations have eclipsed other men. It can be said that the Kant family can climb from the rank of the count to the present Duke of the North, and Itis is indispensable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daughter showed some surprise when she heard the four princes conquering the king of the day, and soon recovered calm again. "Now you know why I didn't agree at the time." Marry to Tefco?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calvin couldn't help but widen his eyes. "Don't you expect this?" After defeating the Duke of Aes, who had intended to rebel, he had stayed in the North for a while. Like most men, he also looked at the pearl of the North, but Itis did not immediately agree to the other side, but used an excuse to subtly remove the messenger sent by the other side. At that time, I was quite puzzled. I even blamed my daughter for knowing that marrying the past is a queen. This is how many women dream of, and the position of the Kant family in the Northland can naturally sit more stable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said that the day broke the city? It didn't," Isis untied the band and let the long cyan hair on the top of the head tilt down. "I just think He is not a suitable candidate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
