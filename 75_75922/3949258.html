			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The witches did not sleep at this time. After a series of sufferings, they still could not believe the fact that they were taken over by the prince. No shackles, no guards, so let everyone live in the castle, still so spacious and comfortable room? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty probably guessed the uneasiness of the sisters. Together with the nightingale, she shouted everyone into her room, sat around the bed and chatted. Come to appease everyone's emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the style of the leader. The leaves are imaginary. If it is Hakala, it will never be so careful, or if she notices it, she will not be at ease. Soothe the sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When Wendy’s sister, His Royal Highness...what will we do?” the hummingbird asked awkwardly, “Our ability is better than you and the night sister. It’s too far to say.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This resonated with other sisters and they nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty snorted, "Let me think, um... the first thing you have to do is to practice your abilities."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Practicing ability?" Soloya hesitated. "Does the Highness will let me keep drawing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Most likely," Wendy patted the mystery moon with her head down. "You too, although Hakala prohibits you from using it in the camp, but your Highness does not. Instead, he will only encourage everyone to pass." Practice and master your abilities as much as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My ability will bring trouble to my sisters," mystery month whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That must also be practiced," Wendy said categorically. "This is related to our lives and deaths."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Life and death?" The leaves couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, His Royal Highness found out that the witch can safely pass the awakening day," said the nightingale, replacing Wendy. "From now on, we can say goodbye to the magic." The pain, all the sisters can live to adulthood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the witches stared at the nightingale, unable to believe their ears. The book asked in surprise, "Is Miss Anna mentioned last time? But you said that it was not clear why."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, at the time It was only His Highness's guess, but then Nana's Awakening Day verified this - she also did not suffer any harm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So this method is... "The book can't help but hold my breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As long as you consume magic every day," Nightingale said one word at a time, "I can see the change of magic in the fog, and use it regularly." The total volume of the body is increased, and the suffering of the phagocytic body is also reduced. When the awakening day is approached, as long as the magic is completely consumed, it will almost harm the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think everyone can feel it faintly," Wendy added. "In the days when the church was chased and hunted, we carefully hid in the corners of the town and did not dare to use it. So many sisters leave us every winter. But this year in the camps of the desolate mountains, except for Aining and Aich, everyone has lived through the demon moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it turned out, the leaves took a deep breath, which is why they encountered the demon phagosome in the wild, and the duration was exceptionally short. "That is, the holy mountain is not in the uninhabited land..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the holy mountain is not a specific place," Wendy nodded. "Where the place where we can accept us, regardless of the witch as the devil, and not limit the ability of the sisters to display, is the holy mountain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wenty has also His Royal Highness has asked for it. He wants to go to the camp after the end of the demon moon. He will tell you this news." The night owl looked at Wendy and said softly, "Even if you don't find the holy mountain, you can also be in the mountains. "Let's live well."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since everyone is back, don't mention this," Wendy shook her head with a smile. "So, no matter whether or not your Highness needs it." You need your ability, for your own safety, you have to practice it every day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
