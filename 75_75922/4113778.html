			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly couldn’t help but nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two weeks, the biggest feeling that no winter city has given her is the attitude of the ordinary city people to the witches - not pretending to be familiar, nor cold-rejecting But half curious and half used to be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, when she was hanging out in the harbour area, she happened to encounter a gust of wind blowing down the empty wooden box on the dock. She subconsciously summoned the magic servant. , caught the fallen box. Not only did the crowds around me scream and flee, but they showed great interest in this transparent footless giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unprecedented experience for Molly, even if it’s sleeping on the island, the displaced islanders are not so close to the witch. Although they still follow the orders of His Royal Highness, the witches are actually alien in their hearts. It is a long-standing practice of most fjords, and only explorers and some businessmen will not mind the power they have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the mainland of the Kingdom, which is deeply influenced by the church, let alone the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lotus first brought back the news of the Grey Fort West, Molly would still be suspicious until he came here, only to find that the stories were too conservative. some. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially seeing the lotus lead a large group of people climbing up and down the high-rise, Evelyn runs a pub that is very lively at any time. And the candlelight that used to be regarded as a useless person, she felt a bit of envy in the scene of being welcomed by everyone in the factory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not afraid of disturbing His Royal Highness, Morrill would have liked to take the initiative to find a job. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, she has never been idle when she was sleeping on the island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, don't forget, we have one of the biggest enemies - the devil." Tilly looked around the audience. "The meaning of the battle of God, you already know, Even the Hermes Church is not worth mentioning in front of such an enemy, so everyone does not work for their own enjoyment. Every banknote means that you do not have a winter city or even a whole human world. The contribution, for the witch, this will be a glory: because everyone can prove to the world that the witch is also an indispensable part of the human race, even a pivotal part!" She raised her right hand and clenched her fist "Sisters who are willing to accept recruitment, please come to the stage now-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Eighty-six jobs, a total of sixty-nine, the results should be fairly good." After the meeting, Tilly handed the list to Wendy, "most of the waiters are just hesitant, if Give them some time, I believe there will be more people to pick up No winter recruitment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not bad," Wendy exclaimed. "It’s beyond the expectations of the Majesty."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh?" Tilly asked curiously. "How much does he guess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty smiled and extended three finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thirty people?" Tilly did not shout. "He is too small to see the sleeping spell."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not so much that he underestimated everyone’s enthusiasm, but it’s your credit,” Wendy put up with a smile and seriously took the ceremony to the five kings. “You don’t have to say the latter. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s just a simple preaching process, 30 people may already be optimistic guesses... It’s Tilly’s "for other sisters, And the rhetoric of raising the reputation of the witch, impressed most people present. As a caretaker of the Communist Youth League, Wendy naturally knows what the companion is most lacking - except for a stable place to rest, the rest is the identity of others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, they have lived as ordinary people for more than a decade, and it is not so easy to be completely separated from the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said it for myself," Tilly smiled and shook her head. "I have seen a lot of interesting things from Roland, and I know how much it is." Unbelievable city. If the battle of divine power is defeated, aren't these all gone? So even if you can see more miracles, you can make a lot of effort. Before the end of the cold winter, hold them together and warm up. It’s wise, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unfortunately not everyone will agree with me," said Tilly, shrugging helplessly. "For example, the witches in the East, they probably will not accept recruitment in the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you mean a small group headed by Ajima?" Wendy said, "Since she and you are not dealing with it, why have you gone to the fjord with you?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not like this at first," the five-wife sighed. "Before they merged into the island, they met the bloody meeting, and the latter In the process of fleeing, they helped them to repel the chasing of the church many times, so Aqima and others trusted Herti Morgan. This is nothing, but later with the bloody teeth and the sleeping spell When the contradiction breaks out, the cracks will follow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out to be..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "And I did not inform everyone, directly shot Herti, but also caused Ajima's resentment. So when they asked to take the Sleeping Beauty number away When I was sleeping on the island, I promised them." Tilly whispered, "In fact, if it wasn’t for the time when the book was dissuaded, they might not be without the winter city."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "It's not your fault," Wendy comforted. "Hetty Morgan is deserving of her guilt. She has deceived the wolf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But she It’s also true that it’s a help for Ajima.” Tilly didn’t seem to want to go into details. “If you change me, my heart may also have a must. After all, they are not bad.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"唔..." Wendy indulged for a moment, "I might have a way to convince them, but..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"but nothing ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe they will be free from the sleeping spell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That and now There is no difference," Tilly said calmly. "If this is good for Roland and them, you should do it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;****** *************<b r /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So...is it okay?" Back in the residential building, Doris showed the color of worry. "We have offended the adult, and now we are Rejecting the work of the no-winter lord, if you completely annoy the other party, I am afraid that we will all..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence has been echoed by several other Eastern witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think Doris is right, Roland Wimbledon is not the general lord, he is now the king of the Grey Fort, even if we can return In the east, it is already his territory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And we are not fighting witches. Once the other party starts, we have no ability to resist. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get it, even if you can play, can you beat the madman? I bet she has long since seen us not pleasing to the eye." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually... I think the Witch Alliance is pretty good for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" I think, they must stand on the side of the king. It’s not bad to catch us when we don’t help.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Don’t say it,” Ajima Interrupted the disputes of the people. "Roland Wimbledon will never use tough means, otherwise the image he created before will be completely in vain. If we agree to the recruitment order, then the previous insistence What became it? In the end, I still had to rely on the sleeping spell. In the eyes of outsiders, we are no different from other witches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she said this, she The heart is also quite entangled. In all fairness, in the past two months, the Witch Alliance has really given them a lot of help. They did not anticipate the bullying, but treated them equally, even the witch named Wendy. She also talked to her about this matter several times. The kindness of the goodness does give her a long-lost feeling of returning home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Ajima knows that she can only continue to be indifferent, she has a hunch, once opened, it is no longer difficult to get out of the sleeping spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a knock on the door sounded outside the house. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
