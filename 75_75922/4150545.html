			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading the entire letter, the clever ghost felt a chill behind it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A devil lord who can open the door to hell and let the troops come and go? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is undoubtedly an extremely important piece of intelligence - in fact, he was puzzled by the unscathed fall of Xueyingbao, but in addition to being able to confirm The devil is invading the city from the north, and the other stories that are heard are simply varied. Apparently seeing the civilians who came to the devil, they have already died in the invasion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he is finally confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is even more shocking to him is that this demon monarch is familiar with human rules, not only will deal with the nobility, but also become a permanent winter in a short time. The actual controllers, the current recruitment of the various territories to recruit people, are basically based on its inspiration. The benefits promised by the other party are also quite rich, and it is by no means the gray castle people can give. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the letter is also very valuable in describing the movements of the people. Although it cannot be equated with the distribution of the devil's power, at least it can be analyzed where they have gone. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is certain that the person writing this letter is by no means a stream of mice or merchants. From a perspective, this person must be positioned in the upper layer of the winter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire piece of paper is well-organized and clearly stated, and it is neither transcribed nor streamlined. As long as it is delivered, it is a key piece of information. As far as priority is concerned, there is no doubt that it belongs to the highest one. The problem is that the team of merchants used to deliver intelligence left Cherying Fort yesterday – in order to be as unobtrusive as possible, the money is only placed in the caravan. There is only one person, or a driver, it is almost impossible to turn the team back, and wait until the next caravan starts in a week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you add time on the road, the time of delivery will only be longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirits hesitated for a long time, and finally stood up and put all the other papers on the table into the cabinet, leaving the letter alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is waterproof sealing wax treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all this, he blows off the oil lamp, puts the letter paper close to him, returns to the first floor, and gestures to the silent person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to go out of the city in person. If there is an accident here, I will light the fire downstairs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the clever ghost turned and prepared to go out, the silent man stretched his hand and shook his head, and then pointed to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him stay, do the dangerous things for himself...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I chuckled. "Just send a letter. You can come back in two or three days. You can't talk, and you don't know where the connection is, you can't help me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that there is no such complicated word in sign language, so he just made a gesture: “This is the order.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take his The hand is released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clever ghost patted the other's chest and left the room without returning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the owner asked him to fully assist the gray castle, it is the first priority to send this letter as soon as possible. After all, according to the gray castle people, the information is time-sensitive. Sex, the more the news gets late, the more variables there are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also set up emergency contact points in the villages that are more than ten miles away from the city, and equipped with incredible animal messengers, I heard that in just a few days Send the news here to the morning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the village is the goal of his trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no risk of leaving the castle, but it is still within the controllable range. In fact, every day people escape from the north through various means, even leaving the winter. The red fog and the bloody red moon on the top of the head have not had a real impact on people's lives. The propaganda of the Grey Fort and the rumors of the devil have been Gradually fermenting, no matter how the lord stops, can not completely dispel the fear of this horrible alien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clever ghost knows that as long as you act alone, the possibility of being stared by the flying devil is not high. As for the guards on the road, it is better to send them. Jinlong is the universal standard in the human world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are almost the same as he expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the next morning was dawning, the ghost spirit passed through the south gate of Xueyingbao, in order to enjoy the golden dragons in his pocket. The guards did not even alarm other people, quietly opening the small door inside the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you cross the ice, the next road will be unimpeded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever he sees a shadow in the sky, he will quickly get into the snow, the white coat becomes a natural cover color, and those footprints are high There is not much difference between watching it in the air and stepping on the beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the afternoon, he was able to faintly see the smoke rising in the village. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wiping the hoarfrost on the nose, the spirit can not help but speed up the pace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the way of receiving in the city, he does not need to dock with the Grey Fort, just put the information in the agreed place and leave the secret number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at this moment, there was a hoof of hooves behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the ghost can not help but see, he looked back, my heart sank, hell, how can there be snow cavalry in the snow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fortress picks this village precisely because it is remote, and it is difficult to be spotted by one or two foreigners. Will be selected near the avenue, there is no reason to run here to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance between the two is quickly zooming in. Obviously the other party has seen him, and it is unlikely that he wants to hide again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the spirit stopped, and piled up a pleasing smile towards the coming people - the other party has a total of two rides, as long as the Golden Dragon is enough, it should not be too It is difficult for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry stopped the horse in front of him and looked at him condescendingly. "Brother, I know that these fugitives will pick some remote roads and they will be taken by us." Find one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, luck is good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough... is catching the evader Patrol? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big, adults, please let me put a living path!" The clever ghost pretends to be extremely scared, plops in the snow, hands up the money The bag reveals the eye-catching golden dragon. "I really don't want to stay in a place with the devils from hell. They are all monsters that don't blink! I am willing to put all the savings, and I beg you to let me go!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? Your savings are still quite a lot." The cavalry leaned over and took the purse, with a smile in his tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now it's yours... Yes, yes, I have relatives in the wolf heart, as long as you don't take me back, I will definitely Find an opportunity to repay you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost is secretly relieved. Generally speaking, this step is basically a pass. The number of refugees who can lay down the Golden Dragon is definitely a minority. Even the "relatives of neighboring countries" will increase the credibility of the credibility - if there is no benefit to killing, they are not willing to have more trouble. After all, letting one or two escapers have no loss to them, there is no need to end up in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the other party did not wave his hand, but picked up his own visor, "Look at me."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a striking scar on his cheek, like a beast that was smashed by the beast, the whole ear was missing, and even half of the eye became deformed and distorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rolled flesh shows that the injury has just healed soon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult, you are..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
