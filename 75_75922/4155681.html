			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell... what is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not far from the God of God The hovering lightning first noticed the vision that occurred on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...they dug up the pillars buried in the ground?" Mai smashed for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sky, the black stuff is really like a pillar standing up, but it’s too strange to be halfway up. What's more, they are surrounded by a floating land, and they don't look like a purposeless display. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a feeling of great uneasiness in the heart of lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She directly activates two blocks of prints, "Here is the expedition! Captured an abnormal situation on the floating land! Repeat, the target has an abnormal situation! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Phoenix received," Tilly quickly replied, "I also noticed the dust rising above, please keep monitoring, I will Inform the Air Knights to be vigilant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is the Seagull," Andrea's second voice, "Can describe in detail "Where is the specific situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." The lightning organization said, "Some black pillars rise from the edge of the earth, seemingly in the city of the devil. The tower is almost the same, I don't know what it is, but the volume is definitely not small -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, she suddenly caught. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw a stone column flashing bright blue light, and the light seemed to be inside, and it reflected its crystal-like outer wall - then something Thunder is too late to rush out of the stone pillar and fly straight into the sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those pillars are hollow inside!" Mai said with exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah? What is hollow?" Andrea still hasn't touched her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning has shouted and shouted, "Fleet, fast evacuation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing Passing over the two people at a very fast speed, and falling along a long parabola into the battle zone between the two sides - this time she saw it very clearly, and the thing that was thrown out was also a stone pillar, shape and spider type. The "column needle" emitted by the beast is the same, but the volume is much larger! At the same time, it is covered with obvious magical fluctuations, and it is like a dripping wave blown by the wind at high speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of a sudden attack, the two sides panicked for a moment, and turned around and swooped, hoping to be avoided in the shortest possible time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the wide sky, whether it is the skyfire or the beast, it is only a negligible point. The distance of more than ten kilometers also lengthens the flight of the stone pillar. Time, it passed through the battlefield, and only a sharply injured, slow-moving beast was smashed and then fell straight to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So? Lightning can't help but see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From such a long distance, projecting an astonishing stone pillar, neither blasting nor splitting into a stone needle rain, it is difficult for the enemy to count on this blow. Can you shoot down all the fires? What is the difference between using a wooden stick to fight a mosquito? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, before she was relieved, the top of the wheat stubble had used her claws to turn her head toward the column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the eyes of lightning and the camouflage of the cannon model When the platform coincides, she suddenly understands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil’s goal was the artillery position from the very beginning! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone pillar broke into the ground and burst into a dazzling blue light - it only ignited a few meters of snow and fog on the hill by the impact, dull The sound is no less than the roar of artillery. Due to its huge size, the stone pillar did not stop immediately, but rolled forward and pushed forward nearly 100 meters, crushing anything that blocked it along the way into pieces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning sucked a cold breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is a blocking position, isn’t it a fierce? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightning, come back, what happened next?" Andrea asked eagerly, "Is Timie dangerous?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the crew is safe and sound, but you better not disturb her now." Lightning looked into the air battlefield - after the stone pillars, both sides were reviving the formation. Obviously this killing is still not over. Then she looked back and regained her gaze back to the camouflage position, and said, "It’s the ground troops... they are afraid of trouble!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not an ordinary stone pillar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the diffuse snow and fog, only the blue light is darker and finally disappears completely invisible. At the same time, the surface of the cylinder peeled off, revealing the internal flesh-like structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She vaguely saw that something had climbed out of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Have you seen it?" Lightning patted the top of the head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McGen raised his head and stared at the earth for a while, "Well... is a spider konjac! Small spider konjac!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cat claws and pomelo peels also witnessed the scene of the destruction of camouflaged positions - despite their perspective Limited, I didn’t see what it was, but the snow that swelled across the hill and the rumble that still echoed showed that the distance of 18 kilometers is no longer safe in front of the mobile fortress. The devil can Hit the enemy points, then you can also hit them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Captain, the enemy has entered the range!" At the other end of the hidden fortification, the observer’s reminder sounded. "There is no tendency to observe the floating land." Three guns can fire directly!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat claw bites the lip and looks at it with the pomelo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The choice to fire now is undoubtedly a great risk, but if you retreat directly, the heroic battles of the Cavaliers and the arrangements of the command will become nothing. significance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes, what can be done is not something we need to consider." The pomelo peeled slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear is no big deal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure is also true. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is to complete your duties as a soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their duty is to pull the artillery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cat's claws took a deep breath and squirmed out of the window hole and blew the action whistle! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is in place immediately, and the shot is completed before the enemy reacts! Quickly, give me a move, let the empty knight guys look at it, Who is the real trump card!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large number of people in the empty position, the white camouflage cloth is uncovered, revealing the pan below Cold light barrel. Unlike wooden models, these war weapons made of steel have an aggressive sense of oppression at all times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not need to push the cat's claws, everyone has already completed the preparatory work of loading, lanyard, etc. The whole process is flowing, and facing the long song a few years ago. The Cavaliers are judged two ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s not just that he is growing alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This army has become a force that can influence the destiny of mankind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Report, No. 1, No. 2, No. 3 guns are all ready!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cat's claws looked at the floating land that was pressed like a mountain in the distance, and spit in disgust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
