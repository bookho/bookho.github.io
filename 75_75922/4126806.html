			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Lightning couldn't help but widen his eyes and slowed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of evil beasts is tens of thousands. They form a wide black carpet on the snowfield, and the surging body can't help but remind her of it. The scene when ants are eating corpses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time they are not facing the corpse of their own, but the same cruel devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skeleton monsters that are comparable to the miracle building slowly move in the herd, seemingly pushed by the enemy’s former attack, but it falls every time. On one foot, there will be several evil beasts that have no time to avoid being trampled into bolognese. Compared to its body shape, the four twisted long legs are as thin as branches, but the little girl is clear, if it is close to watching, the monster's limbs I am afraid it will be thicker than Ms. Ai Gesha’s Master Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many madmen are attached to its abdomen, condescending to launch a wave of spear attacks, and the evil beast can only bite the scalp forward, it is difficult Make an effective counterattack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic parasitic species." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but think of this title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deformed devil between living creatures and dead objects, without a fixed form, like a sarcoma, is usually anchored between the skeleton and the black stone, relying on magic to attack or Actions - The new spiders in the battle of the North Slope, as well as the giants in front of them, are likely to belong to the same kind of devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of how sharp the fangs are, the squatting on the stone is basically a sequel, and the helpless evil beast can only circumvent those skeleton monsters and attack the rear. The main force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no wall to cover, it should be a fierce battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the maddening beast may have an advantage over unarmed humans, but the madness that is extremely good in strength and speed is obviously too weak. Although there are many mixed species among them, the devil also puts the hell lord, the siege beast and the spider magic in front of the front line. The speed at which they kill and mix species is hardly slower than that of the first army. The number of evil beasts is several times greater than that of the devil, but the latter has the upper hand in momentum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s probably that the speed has slowed down, and McMug has re-explored his head. Seeing such an amazing scene, she couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the evil beast fighting the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This year's evil month has no winter city Calm, it should be the reason." Lightning pretend to be old, "But it is very strange - those Taqila ancient witches are not saying that the evil beast always seeks the relics of the gods? If I am the devil The king’s words will certainly not bring the relics to this wasteland where there is nothing. In other words, they should be gathered here for another reason. Unfortunately, Hilli can’t walk with us, otherwise it will be able to collect more. More intelligence.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mc茜歪 started, “Would you like to surprise them?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Of course!" Lightning did not hesitate, "We are so close to the ruins of Takira, and the beasts are not coming to trouble, meaning they can't spare any effort to pay attention to the situation around us. This is for us. Say, it’s a great opportunity.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the devil and the evil beast are the enemies of Roland , If we allow these monsters to fight even more tragic point, could also alleviate some of the pressure for the expedition planned after spring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slightly estimated the magic of the body, if flying at a speed beyond the sound, it can still last for three to four minutes - insurance, leaving half It is absolutely safe to use the magic to escape. The remaining two minutes want to incite the devil's defense line. The selected flying position is crucial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl put her gaze on the skeleton monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These huge deformed structures look like a crooked bench from afar, the body is made up of flat black stone skeletons, and the armpits are built on the east coast. The glider track is quite similar and is an ideal low-altitude target. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
