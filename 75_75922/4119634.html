			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was a very unknown magical reaction behind the camp, Sylvie had not taken care of that much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to keeping a minimum of surveillance and a hasty warning, she turned her attention to the devil army a few kilometers north. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something that has never been seen before, and she can’t even classify it as a dead object or a living body, and it looks like evil in its appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is about the size of a two-story building, contoured like a reptile, resembling a crab or a spider, but the limbs and torso are made up of dark stones. . There is no sense of agility in the walking room. Every step is a glance. Whenever you ignore the surrounding, there are shells falling from time to time. Even if the devils in the same fire are blown into the powder in the gunfire, these monsters have not stopped at all, and they are similar to those invented by Roland. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is not a real machine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a thick outer shell, she can see that there is a hidden pile of creeping flesh inside, the magic of the brilliance flowing in it, and along the thousands of veins Fill into all parts of the outer casing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to describe it, Sylvie can only think of the word parasitic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The living thing is parasitic among the stones and the metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with crawling monsters, those daunting "siege beasts" are not so terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, it is not indestructible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowering bombs fired by the First Army can still cause damage to them, even without direct hits, as long as they fall near the crawling monster, they can destroy their lower limbs. To make it impossible to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, their goals are too small for tens of thousands of devils - even since these monsters have appeared, Sylvie has been guiding artillery The squad fired at them, but the missiles flying for several kilometers could not do anything. When the beasts broke into the artillery positions, only one of the five crawling monsters was stabbed and stagnated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the rear position fell into a scuffle, she couldn’t help but sweat for the front line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artillery may not realize at all how much threat they pose to the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, only one of the people involved in this battle witnessed the amazing destruction of the fortress guns—especially when the devils appeared on the surface The dense formation almost turned the battlefield eight kilometers away into a slaughtering ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time a cannonball falls into the army, it can pick up a soil column that is nearly ten meters high, and at the same time bring up a broken limb with a broken limb; Enough to penetrate the enemy's skins, not to mention the shrapnel. The mad and burly body became the best target in front of the flow, often after a bombardment, dozens of devils lay down on the crater layer, the magical blood immersed in the land, like a blooming blue flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just three rounds of volley, the enemy’s feet were turbulent—this is still the case when the shells are occasionally missed. Although the devil dispersed the formation, the roaring death still puts them under great pressure, which can be seen from their speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not the interference of the beast, I am afraid that the enemy has been completely defeated. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the artillery team recovered some of the artillery, but the head and the rate of fire are not as good as the beginning, the devil took the opportunity to advance quickly, until the multi-magic source reaction appeared At the rear of the position, the enemy army has approached the position two kilometers from the line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the frontline soldiers should have been able to see the devil from the horizon with the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi issued a warning to the Sawyer who was on the front line in accordance with a pre-planned plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy has entered the range of mortar strikes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a point...an accident," Sylvie hesitated. "But there should be no problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If Andrea is here, it should be early. Just end the fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm...maybe," in order not to let Sawyer worry too much, she decided to hide what she saw. . Just talking, she suddenly noticed that the four crawling monsters in the Devil's army stopped moving forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They spread their long legs and crouched one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is what you want to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi soon saw that the carapace on the back of the monster opened to the sides, and a black crystal-like cylinder protruded from it - it had One person is thick and the surface is covered with mucus, as if it grows out of the meat. Like the crawling monster body, the long column is also covered with blood vessels and meridians, and it contracts with the flow of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, the magical vortex in the monster's body ran fast and burst into a dazzling light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the black stone column is suddenly pushed out by the huge force, over the heads of many devils, flying straight to the north slope, its momentum is like A magnified 100 times! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the First Army’s mortars also screamed at this time-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining shells skyrocketed, crossed a high parabola, and then, under the influence of gravity, fell against the running devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a moment when the shells crossed the stone pillars, as if they represented the forces that the two ethnic groups had mastered after four hundred years, once again colliding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sawy, open the shield!" Hillvi shouted with all his might. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, the thick stone pillar flew above the line of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a flash of magic light, the whole column burst open, the crystal split into a dense long needle, mixed with blue blood, shot down to wait for the enemy soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the artillery positions were quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha and others took the artillery near the behemoth for the first time, while the high-range machine gun team was fighting the last few fearful beasts. There are more than a dozen goddess of witches and high-level devils hidden under armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter glanced coldly at everyone, suddenly screaming in the sky, and its voice even overshadowed the scream of a machine gun in the distance - anyone can feel it Get the anger contained in this howling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it stretched out his right hand and held it straight to the sky, only to see a light leap from its palm, and instantly turned into a squeaky sword! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it lifted the sword to the side of the fortress gun, accompanied by a heartbreaking tear, the steel cast barrel was actually divided into two, its The fracture is like a high temperature burning, showing a bright red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ice witch can't help but hold her breath, which is clearly a weapon of magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Zoe was unmoved. "Why, are you dissatisfied with your opponent? With a heart of death, you find that you are only a group." "People?" She raised her lips and looked relaxed. There was a hint of mockery in her tone, but there seemed to be a flame burning in her eyes. "Your biggest mistake is that you ran down. If you stayed in the sky, you might still be able to live for a while. Now, you can feel the anger of the four hundred years of anger. As for your anger. It’s not worth mentioning!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they can’t communicate, each other’s attitude has been revealed, the devil roars and throws the magic sword in his hand—the latter Like a striking thunder, shoot straight towards Zoe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two gods of the gods around Zoe are close to her, and at the same time, they have launched the "God of Punishment"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
