			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The campsites of the Red Rock Gate and the Tooth Family are located on the boulevard outside the city, which was originally used as a place to provide temporary residence for caravan mercenaries. Now, Was specially vacated and handed over to the mission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the dangers of being backed by the sinking bay, there is almost no danger in the area, so there is only one circle of low wooden fence around the house, and even the access control is not set. In addition, the only force that might pose a threat to the mission is the other party’s mission. Therefore, the two sides did not plan to look at each other. They also used a spear and a shield to separate a dividing line in the center of the clinic. Indicates the ownership of their respective camps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, most people know that this dividing line is just a symbol. As long as the lord of Shenchiwan did not make a decision, the two missions would not completely tear the face, so the usually arranged guards only mean meaning, not to mention the heavy rain outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the First Army’s 100-person team approached the distance of two hundred meters away, the two families were still unaware. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knights realized that the situation had changed until the sound of persuasion penetrated the rain screen and resounded over the camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the first army of the Grey Fort, and now officially takes over the Shenchi Bay. According to the law of no winter city, your current behavior constitutes the crime of illegal embezzlement and armed Intervention of sin, you are allowed to disarm within a quarter of an hour, surrender, or we will take coercive measures, all consequences are your responsibility!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to use One word to describe, that is inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the fangs opened the curtains and saw a man standing outside the fence, holding a strange cylinder and shouting. Not far away, there is indeed a flag that hangs down, and the emblems of different colors are looming, which is not a common pattern of wolves. Only he has been unable to link this sudden emergence of the hundred people to the gray fort. For him, it is a distant and unfamiliar country, and it usually only appears in various rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, those people were covered in cloaks, and the rain smacked on them without any mercy. It looked embarrassing and ridiculous and pitiful. Coupled with the sparse squad, the team is clamoring to force the disarming of seven or eight hundred people, which further deepens this unrealistic feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the group went downstairs and found that the mercenary on the first floor was squeezing at the window, licking each other’s maternal relatives in extremely vulgar language, and comparing them Under the flow of the posture, if it is not raining outside the house, no one wants to get wet easily, I am afraid they have spit on the face of the screamer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also worthy of their despicable origins. The head of the team thought a little bit gloating, but as a nobleman, he must consider it more comprehensively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, what if the other party is really a Gray Fortress? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you should first look at the reaction of the old rival Redstone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, this group’s request is to surrender, he can’t really give up this order, not to mention that if he only sent his men to negotiate, it would fall. Subordinate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance between the two sides is so far away, the head of the team does not have to worry about the sudden attack of the other side, the mercenaries have already taken the weapons at hand, and the "cloaks" team also I can't see the trace of a horse, enough to prepare for it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this careless arrangement, time passes by, he completely ignores the warnings of the First Army, or that he is not aware of it. The threat in the warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the wolf-hearted aristocracy, engagement is a long and time-consuming process, from observing the enemy, making decisions to issuing instructions, and welcoming Enemies are all done step by step within the scope of their eyesight. Even if they are as strong as the Hermes Church, they are not separated from this category. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It can be said that the first army that has experienced the baptism of the devil is not at the level of consciousness, but is not at the same level as these nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle broke out so suddenly that almost no one could react. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a quarter of an hour passed, the first fires were four mortars - they completely replaced the heavy and inconvenient old-fashioned front field guns, although they were less powerful than the fortress. Cannons, but it is more than enough to deal with simple fortifications and wooden whistle towers. Because they can be dismantled to carry the action, the soldiers are full of trust in this weapon, and they are often used as the horn of the attack in the battle of unity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
