			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diffuse Star Bachelor is working as usual, and colleagues calculate the design draft from the Ministry of Industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a work that seems to never end, but surprisingly feels full - unlike the observational astrology, each result they measure, Both will determine the direction of the design and eventually turn it into a tangible result. Although he often relives the stars with new astronomical telescopes when he is idle, the focus of the past two years has been more and more placed in the arithmetic yard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more he counts, the more he feels about the phrase "describe everything with numbers". Astrologers don't know much about manufacturing, but if the curves or lines depicted by those numbers look very harmonious, the relevant design results can be finalized. There seems to be some strange connection between the two. Sometimes he even can't tell whether the creation determines the number or whether the number determines the creation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you master a certain degree, will you not need physical objects, and through a series of numbers and expressions, you can determine the characteristics of an unknown thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s this wonderful association that gives him new expectations every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The calculation result of the twenty-sixth item is 3,475, which is beyond the limit." The assistant carefully pressed the report on the mechanical calculator and reported it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stuff is rare, hand-made by His Royal Highness Anna, no more than ten in the whole winter, basically allocated to the Executive Office and the Arithmetic Institute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diffuse Stars nodded, and when the pen was ready to record on the book, the lights on the top suddenly flashed. The light bulb sizzled and it seemed that something went wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no way to stop the work at hand and wait for the lighting to return to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"哐当!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next room is followed by a crisp sound, as if something Falled to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bachelor frowned, he knew that the important instrument of the ancient witch was in the room, and he had to pay more attention when he was cleaning the apprentice. How can he still do this? accidentally? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what he didn’t expect was that the perpetrator quickly rushed out of the room and ran to him with a panic. "Big, big, adult! That skeleton The child is floating!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The diffuse star bachelor took a look and quickly went to the door of the house, then widened his eyes in surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw that the originally closed skeleton was completely scattered, and it seemed to be changing its own form, and its central part was blooming with dazzling brilliance, as if waking up from a deep sleep. Come over! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this possible! ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few people in the arithmetic center who know the existence of the carrier - except for the ancient witches who are in the form of sarcoma, no one can use these magical things. They dug a dark passage under the arithmetic yard to house the central carrier, which is why it was stored in the arithmetic school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light did not last long. After only ten interest, the skeleton returned to a closed state and slowly landed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, I just wiped the dust off with a wet rag, absolutely nothing else!" The lost apprentice explained in a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is nothing wrong with you here, go out." Diffuse Star Bachelor said with a calm expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the door was closed, he took out a special key from his close-fitting pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way to get to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than one ancient witch in the form of sarcoma, but this difference under the ground - I heard that she has no mind, only the ability to answer questions, so it must be locked with a chain In case of an accident. The bachelor is no stranger to her. She has made great contributions in the past to check the calculation results, but he has not forgotten the warning of the Pasha adults. Once the other person gets out of trouble, the power of the carrier can easily tear up any close people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What shocked the star, however, was that the central carrier did not leave where it was, but the whole softness, the tentacles twisted and twisted together, and there was no sign of activity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s over...how can it be...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diffuse star knows that the problem is far beyond him The range that can be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned sharply and ran towards the ground, and shouted in his mouth. "Come, come to the castle to inform the book!" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ray that glowed out of the cluster quickly dissipated, and the ash glowed in less than a few seconds It is extinguished as if it were a short-lived fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failed...? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin looked at the net without a word, and for a moment, she clearly connected to the magic core, but why did the light not continue? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally she intended to use the balance mode to connect the two ends, and then Eleanor to analyze the four core instruments, but now hope seems to have become a bubble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if she wants to try again, she can hardly concentrate on her spirit again - the erosion of the mask has gradually affected her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without the support of the god stone veins, the network will not last long... It will eventually need magic to run, or do you think that I am allowed to leave those magic cores free?" Nasopelle shrugged. "Although I can't understand it, but my will, your soul and knowledge, I accept it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't Will allow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a voice that does not belong to both of them suddenly appears in this space of consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cylin stunned, this voice seems to have met, strangeness is mixed with incomprehensible familiarity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and saw a woman standing quietly behind Nasper Peel, her long hair almost hangs to her ankles, her eyebrows Exquisite, the pair of half-brown gray eyes with a lingering lazy intention, also made her in stark contrast with the other two seats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eleanor...Adult!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyrin blurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can hardly believe her eyes! After more than four hundred years, she once again saw the head of the federation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are Celine? I remember your voice. And this guy should no doubt be a high-level devil..." Eleanor glanced around A circle, "Where is this place? In the new soul container?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will tell you everything later, but now I have no time to explain it. Celine eagerly said, "Please help me restart those magic cores and drive out the devil! It’s too late to come!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha ......hahahaha..." The mask smiled. "When I did something, I sent more gifts! Is this female strong? Unfortunately, I am not an entity, and the fighting ability is not here. It’s ridiculous to analyze the four cores, in terms of computing power—”<br /> on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It clearly shows that the star-shaped gyro is changing. First, a few sudden lumps of light are emerging, and then the assimilated area expands rapidly, just like welcoming The flow of water in the opposite direction of the waterfall suppresses the rotation of the star and forces it to start to rotate in the opposite direction - under the interlacing of the two forces, the four cores re-emerge with dazzling light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The God of God who regained the power has entered a state of rapid deceleration, and the diffused red fog begins to shrink inward, and the surface of the already foggy lake has changed again. It was like a crystal, and the first soldiers who were on the promotion square were all pressed on the ground and could not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?!" Nasopelle stunned. "How can one understand the structure of the magical cyclone so quickly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
