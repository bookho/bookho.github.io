			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a pub in the Dagon Island Pier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jo fiddled with the wine glass in his hand, looking at the entrance from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never felt that time was so hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repentance, fear, distress, and volatility take turns in the bottom of my heart, but apart from continuing to wait, he can't do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hooded man walked into the pub and sat down next to Joe, he was relieved, but followed It’s bigger and more uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She...what is the situation now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jo stared at each other's lips, for fear See the worst answer -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Also alive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party’s answer Let him slow down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Farina is not doing well," the man took off his hood and looked worried. "What the bishop seems to want from her." Everything, every day, people will torture her - sometimes she can hear her screams in the hall, so that she will not be able to stand up sooner or later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; This is all expected, Joe repeatedly told himself that since they failed to attack the castle, all those who are still alive will be subjected to cruel revenge, and Farina, who is the leader, is no exception. Moreover, the traitor also hopes to get the whereabouts of the Holy Scriptures from her, and will naturally use her means to force her to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just stay alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he said this in his heart, his fingers fell deeply into his palm. He didn't even dare to think about it. If you can't save Falinena, maybe it will be a luxury when you die...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn! Why do you want to promise her, Joe reluctantly thinks, what attracts the attention of the enemy, so that the gods can break through from the side; what wars are in a disadvantage can be retreat first, he is not as good as everyone, directly in the castle, so at least At the last moment of my life, I can accompany my majesty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Adult..." The man hesitated for a moment. "Do you know what the bishop wants? If you have it, it is better to give it to him." So Farina is at least not--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a bishop, a traitor! Joe bit his teeth. "His things are not in my hands. It has long since fallen along with the Cathedral of Hermes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hermes, the face of the other side showed a clear sadness. "May God bless us..." he whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a sarcasm, Joe thought, when the old and new holy city is still there, he is already the leader of the younger generation of the trial army. The outstanding people will not put the general public in the eye. As a result, at this step, the bishop’s rebellion and the divine deviance, the only thing he can rely on is such a normal can not be ordinary. Moreover, the feelings of the other party to the church are actually deeper than many high-level officials. If this is not the case, they will not take the initiative to find him when he is on the verge of collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't be dissatisfied with Lorenzo's identity as a bishop, and he was not satisfied with his own status, but he happened to peek at the night of the battle. The appearance of the attacker, and then left a more thought when hanging around the castle - this is the whole process of the two met. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe doesn't even have to worry about this being Lorenzo's plan. He has nothing at all, and it's not worth the effort. If this person is sent by a traitor, after several contacts, he should have long seen that he has no value and chose to get rid of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately this person used to be a famous communicator. Now he is only a lower-level servant. Apart from giving him extremely limited information, he can't do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to go back," after a long silence, the man put on a hood. "If you leave the castle for too long, the management will be suspicious. The next time you come out After three days, are we still seeing here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," he said slightly. "Adult, please cheer up - if someone can save the Farina, then you are the only one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I? No... I can't do anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is darkness in my mind, I can’t see the turn and hope at all. No matter how you pray to the gods, you can't get a response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right," the other man turned away after two steps. "One more thing happened recently in the castle, one of the bishop’s cronies. The Hagrid officer went to the southwest with a pair of people. I heard the groom said that they seemed to want to cross the border of the cage. I think this news may be...helping you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the comfort of this statement is too obvious, even when his voice is small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, it is normal for the lord to send people to other territories. Even if the location of the cage is a little special, it is completely irrelevant to Dagong Island. As long as Lorenzo did not take away the godly warrior, breaking into the dungeon to rescue Farina would be tantamount to idiots and dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where, adult..." He leaned Slightly bowed, "I can do this for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cage Mountain... Recently, the word is really a bit too much. Joe poured the ale of the glass into his mouth and filled the mouth with bitterness, but in the next moment, he slammed into place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait--Cage Hill? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like an electric light to cut through the darkness, Joe suddenly had an idea in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A possible turnaround! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the temporary house outside the city, Joe cast his gaze on the table On a black book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the last willingness of the Pope Tucker Thor to jump off the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a record of the church's inheritance - the sanctification of the method of God's penalty, but a dying predecessor. In the book, he tells the story of humans and demons, and the origin of the war of divinity. This shocking secret made everyone stunned, and suddenly realized the reason why Tucker decided to let everyone withdraw from Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's put down the burden and spend the rest of his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably because of this self-sacrifice, Farina is not willing to sit down and watch the church dissipate - Joe knows clearly, except for the feelings of Hermes In addition, she still has a lingering mourning: that is, watching Roland Wimbledon and his Grey Fort Kingdom fall into hell before the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, his turn has appeared in the king who destroyed the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe did not expect the Grey Fort to lend a helping hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s almost impossible to let those people take the initiative to save the remnants of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only has a chance to lead the traitors to the Dagong Island. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news that the Grey Fortress suddenly appeared in the Cage Mountain area did not attract his attention. There were too many noises in the pub, and the church would not be with the gray again. There was no connection in the fort until the believer’s words suddenly inspired him. Once Lorenzo was responsible for collecting the materials looted from the wolves, and the legendary Chamshan treasure was not secret. It was also a special seizure. Specially reported the obituary. As for whether it was shipped to Hermes, Joe is not clear, but this is not important. The important thing is whether the king of the Grey Fort is also looking for the same thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf aristocrats will be timid, Roland will not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
