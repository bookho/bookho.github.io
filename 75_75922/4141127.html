			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this sentence is spoken, the Holy See is awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All strength?" Bloody Maharaja is cold and cold, "What does it mean?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Literally, once he opened his head, Heikezode found himself relaxing, "abandoning the cities that have mined the gods and veins, giving most of the land to the Tianhai world, and then putting all the troops into the dawn." Ten times the existing plan, but all - including existing and new, former servants, until the demise of humanity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"放肆!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It... is it crazy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The millions of people in the city go again Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although I didn't say it on the letter, I think it should be the fertile plains - it is wide enough to accommodate all immigrants." Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not an ant moving," the mask was smirked. "The tower of birth is not moving. Is it suicide to move them over?" After the moon has come, we only have one chance to erect a new tower. If it can be built in Taqila, it is not bad. The problem is that your genius general has already handed over the fertile plains. Now, is it too late?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that it wants to give up Takira, Hecksod’s face is expressionless, the so-called second-hand preparation is nothing but a helpless choice in a limited force, and refuses to increase the number of troops. It is the supreme king. Of course, it will never disagree with Wang Xinsheng for this reason. This little complaint is just instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, instinct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you follow this line of thinking, it doesn't mean you can't do it anyway," it paused. "For example, use the god of God." —”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Absolutely not!” Bloody has not waited for it to finish, and interrupted loudly. “That’s the only hope for us to counter the Tianhai world. Dealing with bugs? Don't be kidding!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The god of God is the core of the third battle of God," Wang also said. "All plans are centered around It unfolds, it is impossible to change the string because of one's judgment, even if it is the new Maharaja. This point does not need to be discussed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the king made The decision has already made a final decision on behalf of the matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heckzod breathed a sigh of relief, and in fact even thought that Ursuk’s rhetoric was too striking, if it’s not the bottom of his heart, it’s I don’t want to mention the contents of the letter in front of all the Maharajas, especially bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, it is doing its part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition, I think that the requirement to increase the number of troops by ten times is also nonsense..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; When bloody is going to chase after victory, someone suddenly cuts off its words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel that I can't completely ignore the warning from Erskuk." The voice of the speaker is not big, but it makes everyone one of them - that is It is the guardian of Wang Cheng, "the disaster of silence." Although it is a Maharajah, it rarely speaks in the Holy See. It is always silent and almost silent, just like its title. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is also one of the strongest majestic fighters, and the "fake face" and "disgusting heart" are not strong enough to wear clothing. The guy who hides his defect is different, and silence is pragmatic. Obviously, the degree of evolution is extremely high, but almost all of them are put in a dark armor, and the head is also covered with strictness. It seems that the image is not the same as comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reason?" Wang asked succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this world...there may be fragments of inheritance that we don't know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hall is commotion again - this sentence is even more surprising than Erskuk's last words! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's hard to believe that humans have been upgraded through ways we don't know, so we need to deal with them all?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where did you hear about this news? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people questioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't have any evidence, just my own guess." The silence was slow, "I have seen it in the realm of the gods." Some...incomprehensible sights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you say it?" Half of the king’s eyes looked at it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence shook his head. "It’s hard to describe in words. Please ask Wang and you to watch my memory directly." Then he leaned over and lowered his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So..." Wang suddenly opened all eyes! At that moment, Heckzor only felt a tremor, and a very cold feeling got into his mind, and the resistance and rejection generated by the body also rose to the apex. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the discomfort caused by the forced injection of consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I am absolutely loyal to the king! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of the sky forcibly suppressed the instinctive rebellion and accepted the consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a series of weird pictures appeared in front of it, it seems to be a mixture of countless fears, which can be directly reflected in the depths of the heart through the eyes, making it difficult Self-extraction. Among these pictures, there is a faint picture of a human being, and he stands indifferently in the cold, as if he is admiring its struggles - Heikezode knows that these are not pure illusions, one root The black tentacles that represent erosion are madly attacking "self". If you don't want to escape, it will be swallowed up by the conscious community! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then escaped and rushed to break the armrest of the throne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment, Heckzod suddenly woke up from the memory of the other person - in such a short period of time, it has felt the coolness behind it. The other monarchs also seemed to feel the same, and the hall heard a thick gasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point everyone understands the meaning of the words of silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a well-known relationship between the fragments of inheritance. When using debris and other ethnic groups to communicate with each other, there is a price to pay. In general, those who are involved in less awareness will pay more. If there is a witch in the realm of the gods, then there is nothing strange about it. It is totally different to actively explore the conscious world and inadvertently involved. The latter cannot be used as a measure of strength, especially for witches with amazing ability. In terms of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the figure is a male. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And human males have never had signs of using magic in their records for more than a thousand years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not due to upgrade, it is really difficult to explain this vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Heikzod also understood why the other party said this until today - the bug that was crushed by a foot lifted scared The throne is fleeing, and I am afraid that no one will change it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can’t help but be curious, will the cheek hidden under the dark helmet be blushing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that wearing armor all day is not without benefits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait... It’s hard to say that it’s because of this reason that the silence caused the king to apply for a replacement guardian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, soon the Maharaja looked at it, "Lord, you are -"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "No, although I have entered the realm of the gods several times, but I have not seen any vision," Heikezod quickly stood up. "If there is, I will definitely report to the king for the first time." Besides, with my understanding of the ideology, it may only be reversed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
