			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf Kingdom, Shenchiwan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waitra took a car and drove into the lively port area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Ladies and gentlemen, our destination is coming, no matter how good you have been before, but then there will be a new life waiting for you. I wish you all the best in advance, and provide the last convenient service by the way!" He pulled the reins and let the horse slow down and screamed enthusiastically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His recent days have been really good - since the arrival of the Greysburg fleet, the business of Shenchiwan has suddenly prospered, especially in short-haul transportation. On this item. If you pull people from the surrounding towns to the port, you can earn ten silver wolves. You can do this at least twice a day. If you are not afraid of damage to the carriage, you can pull in a batch at night, and the income actually catch up with the church. The day of working. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betterly, the reward is not to ask the people on the car to collect it, but to be distributed by the Grey Fortress, as long as it is covered on a piece of paper. The signatures of the two places, after passing the checkpoint, will be rewarded according to the standard of the number of people, and will be issued immediately, and will not be in arrears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this reason, transportation has become a hot industry for a while, and many sailor handymen have joined in, even if they don’t drive the carriage, they can find someone to join. When you run, you don't have to pick up the passengers. When you get to the location, you can start with a full car. The efficiency is extremely high. The only thing you need to consider is the city you are going to. - After all, the distance is linked to the cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort is obviously trying to treat everyone equally, no matter how much money is available, as long as they are willing to leave the wolf, they will help. However, the king of the Grey Fortress has a big career and can withstand random toss, but White does not want to let go of this hard-won opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a fool to have money and not earn money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's more, he has already heard about it, what seems to have happened in the north, the number of refugees who have entered the wolf from the border is increasing sharply, and those rumors are not without According to the rumors. In addition, he also heard from the clever ghost, the lord of Shenchi Bay, Baron Bet, quietly dragged a lot of things from the mansion to the ship. If even the baron has to avoid risk, he naturally has to make plans in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make more money now, and you can have more room for turnover in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of convenient service?" Someone asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some useful experiences and reminders." White pointed to the harbor pier where the big ships gathered. "Look there, although everyone wants to go to the Grey Fort, the journey is not The same. Before they came here, I stayed in Shenchi Bay, and I heard about some things, maybe I can help you in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"That... please tell us..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, the premise is that you have to spend a small amount of money. Not much, one It’s just like a silver wolf.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White knows that those who are penniless don’t care about their own future, as long as they have a meal, don’t ask not much differences. Therefore, from the beginning, his goal is to be a small-sized escaped person - they are always very good at this kind of partial benefit, and the charge is not high, so there is no one in the carriage. It’s not too much to resist buying a message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he was also such a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, the trick of the mouse." A well-dressed Hefa man smiled and smiled. "Unfortunately, the courage is not as good as the mouse, a silver." Wolf, reward him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was quickly handed over to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actually brought along, it seems to be a nobleman... White smiled happily, but he didn’t care, but he didn’t even have a carriage. I have to squeeze a car with the civilians, and then the aristocrats can go anywhere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is my share." Another young man hesitated and took out a silver wolf from his pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only two people are willing to pay the bill, Vannara stopped the carriage and waited for the meeting, and saw no one to scream, then he intended to open the door. In any case, there is better than nothing, it is not bad to pull two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
