			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the summary of the final battle, the General Staff Department also made a preliminary plan for the third battle of the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the current enemy’s attack intentions are not clear, one thing is certain, no matter which direction the devil attacks, Tachella should not give up. As a nail nailed to the fertile plains, it can not only curb the expansion of the devil, but also the cornerstone of the winter city without entering the broader field. As long as Tajira is in the hands of human beings, there will be no danger of being suddenly covered by red mist in the northwest of the Grey Fort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it is necessary to rehabilitate the holy city that has been abandoned for hundreds of years into a frontier fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the main force of the devil still comes from the fertile plains, then the first army must do is to strengthen the defense of the railway line, prevent the enemy from cutting off the supply line and actively attack Its red fog outpost, the entire strategic plan is basically the same as the torch action. Although the pressure is huge, it is a good experience. As long as you can withstand it, human victory is just around the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s simple to describe it, just like a set of emoticons that Roland often sees in the future: don’t be jealous, just do it! I won the cough, cough, and cough, and lost the sea to fish. In short, I can do my best. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem lies in the wolf heart and the winter in the northeast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case the enemy really enters the hinterland of the human kingdom from the direction of the mainland spine, combat becomes a very troublesome problem - the wolf heart is more hills, the winter is still missing The river, plus the middle of the morning kingdom and the two mountain ranges, all the way to the north side of the mainland can not be realized in the short term. The tunnels and bridges needed to cross the natural danger are difficult to solve technically. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the First Army cannot expect the local aristocracy to provide logistical support for them. After the implementation of the population plan, they will inevitably succumb to the gray castle. The sickle is not unexpected. Therefore, this part of the work can only be sent to the military itself to complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, the only reliable transportation method is only shipping. The problem is that the port cities are concentrated on the east side of the mainland, which is detrimental to the development of the defense line. Once the dumplings were made by the devil, there was no way to retreat. It was okay to hold on to it. If it was lost, the loss would be quite heavy. In addition, in addition to the need to fight the devil, the First Army has to assume the responsibility of protecting and evacuating the people. Compared to the endless, uninhabited fertile plains, there are battles in other countries. Too much uncertainty. Because of this, the plan of the General Staff Department did not even define a plan involving the north side. It only mentioned this possibility. Even before the meeting, he noticed that there was a dark circle on the face of Isis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since being deceived by Ersruck’s strategy, Northland Pearl seems to be more persistent in winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put down all the reports and sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, it’s natural to hope that the devil will continue to attack from the fertile plains better, but before the lightning and the Tacula detection team get the exact news, this It is not a question that can be judged by personal preference. Instead of entangled with the enemy's choices, it is better to use your own way to improve the winning percentage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of here, he stood up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"陛下?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me go to a new research institute," Roland said slowly. "It’s also a good idea to see where the glorious plan is going."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Winter City, North Slope Lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna Daren--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucia White just interrupted and was interrupted by Anna "All said, don't call me an adult."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes... I thought that you are a queen, you can't help but shout out." She was embarrassed. I spit out my tongue and put down the metal block in my hand. "The materials you need, I am ready, if nothing else..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
