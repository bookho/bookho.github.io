			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty has been through for a while to figure out the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She first touched her own recovery of the original thigh, and looked at the night squinting a few eyes before she moved her eyes to Roland. "You cured me." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Other days, you will be dragged down by you," he asked, sitting in front of the cage and asking, "Tell me, those Where did the witches who you refused go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is...Iphile told you?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the witch named Anne is her friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty bites her teeth, but does not answer, but Roland saw a thick hatred from her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can clearly accept them. Dagong Island is the land of the Grand Duke of Morgan. You are his successor. It is impossible to raise more than a dozen auxiliary witches. He bluntly said, "Even if they are nothing, it is just two servings of porridge a day, not to mention the use of the witch is much greater than you think. Andrea hits your musket, it is the witch." A weapon made with ordinary people does not use the threshold. Even a farmer who deals with the land all day can easily kill an experienced knight after taking it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hetty looked awkward and raised his head. "What do you say? Can ordinary people use it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You thought I was relying on Did the witch lay the king's capital and become the king of the Grey Fort?" Roland straightened up and leaned back on the chair. "If they can do this, they will not be suppressed by the church and the secular forces."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The musket...how did it come out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Herti coldly, until she realized that she was scornful. "Why, do you think this is at the palace banquet?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She unwillingly swallowed, "You are on the side of you..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The nightingale is my person, with Tilly Nothing," Roland said. "I ask again, where have the witches who you refused go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I let them go, let They went to find other witch organizations themselves. I don't know the specific whereabouts. Maybe... some of them went back to nearby towns, and some went to the mornings—"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You lied, "She hasn't finished, and the nightingale will break the line. "There is no truth in the words."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, squat, she simply Nothing to know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is nothing to justify," Roland shook his head. "The nightingale is able to discern lies, and any words that are against the heart can't escape her." Review. Do you know why Tilly is going to transport you through the fjord and send it to the West for trial? If you don't want to suffer, you will say everything you have done. My patience is limited."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the faint fire, Herti’s look looked cloudy and clear, apparently she did not expect the other party to have such ability. After a short silence, she suddenly held the iron railing and sighed. "Wurbonton squats, the wolf kingdom has been annexed by the church. The wolf king is now missing. I am the last blood of the Morgan royal family. You can help me regain the wolf." Heart, I can bring you countless benefits! Golden Dragon, Jewelry... Right, and witch! Bloody will only be you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This is what you want to say last time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can even give you half a wolf! With Blackrock Cliff as the boundary, the western boundary is all attributed to "You are all!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough," Roland said. "I just want to know the whereabouts of the witches!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Hetty didn't dare to set the channel. "Is my kingdom not comparable to those witches?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You didn't listen Do you understand me?" He was a little tired of his heart. "The wolf heart is neither your kingdom nor I am interested in the land thousands of miles away. The question is now only for the nobles. Basic etiquette, I have many ways to let you speak. You should know more about me than torture. It is not good for you except for suffering. Now I am still here, what you have done. Everything is explained, so I can spare you a life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
