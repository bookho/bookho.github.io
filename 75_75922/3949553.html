			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland's eyes widened, "use dead already-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," The other party interrupted, "The same as the blood of the devil, it must be fresh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard the nightmare behind him sucking his breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the top secret of the Quest. It was not long before the test began. I left the Holy City Stone Tower. The only thing I know is that they use the old and weak witches. The blood is mixed with the stone of the gods and injected into the mortal body, so that the body of the mortal changes." Aegusa's voice is a bit heavy. "From the note you found, the study should be successful. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How much blood do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"More than half," the witch's answer lets Roland’s heart sinks. “And the blood must come from the same person, otherwise the magic contained in it will conflict with each other, causing a significant drop in effectiveness.” She paused. “You guessed it. Every time you experiment, there will be a witch who will die. It is difficult for mortals to survive the erosion of the blood of the weakened power. At the beginning, no one can survive, and many members have raised objections to it, arguing that it is impossible for mortals to gain magic. If not the chief Aka Lisi’s insistence that this plan is not the same Can be executed until the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now the church has a large number of gods and penalties... According to Tilly's intelligence, the number of godly warriors may be five hundred to A thousand or so." Roland frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Assume that success on the note means increasing the conversion rate to 10%, which means that at least half of the witches are killed, and I think those people should not To such a large number of elderly witches."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore the church arrests witches and raises witches in order to dry them up and use them to make powerful extraordinary warriors. ? Roland felt that the hand on his shoulder couldn't help but grasp it. Damn, hundreds of witches with all kinds of strange powers died in the holy city of Hermes, and they still have to carry them. The name of the fallen is rejected by the world - such ignorant organizations must be destroyed, even if their original intention is to fight against the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, I will stop them," Roland said word by word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha left, the nightingale was out of the fog, appeared in front of him, biting his teeth, "I didn't expect the gods to be punished like this! If the church is really united It will change, and their chief must be a madman!" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Indeed," he sighed. "So, the church adopts female orphans everywhere." It’s okay to abandon the baby. They are just collecting materials for the big army. Perhaps it’s part of the plan to smear the witch into the devil's minions—in order to make the witches legitimate.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." The nightingale did not answer, but the face was full of anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rolando grabbed her hand with some concern, "You don't plan..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Is the trouble of going to the church alone?" She shook her head. "I won't be so stupid. If they can really be overthrown by a witch, then someone has done this already."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince was relieved a little. "The ultimate goal of the church to create the gods is to strengthen their own strength. Therefore, if the witches who are raised have the ability to be extraordinary, they will not be consumed in the blood supply... face these The witch who owes allegiance to the church can't guarantee safety even if it breaks into the fog. Waiting for the war with the church, it is safe to follow the firepower of the first army. No matter what the enemy is, there is no difference in front of the bullet." Suddenly, "I said that in the new world of the future, the witch will live the same normal life as the ordinary people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, "The nightingale should be low and put the forehead on Roland’s head. "I believe you can Go to it all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wendy sent the white paper back to the Witch House, he returned to the Lord's Castle with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She recently felt that her life was very fulfilling. Although her life was quite pleasant, she always felt that she was missing something. Now she has a special skill. There is nothing more pleasant about this little girl who is full of admiration for herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
