			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the eyes of the public, the book took a quarter of an hour to sink into the heart, capturing the magical fluctuations in the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she opened her eyes again, she was already in a small "archive". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice also appeared next to her - as a young witch. Hundreds of years did not leave any trace on the other side. Although Feili spent much longer than her, at the moment she became the other's elder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What should we do next?" asked the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give it to me." Felice showed a confident smile, then opened the iron door and walked out of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly followed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The busy and bustling city is once again in the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw Felice looking around and quickly locked a young man on the way. She pulled up the book's hand and stopped in front of each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who heard the greeting stopped and looked away A small box in the hand was removed and looked up with a little doubt. But at the moment when the line of sight intersected, the man’s eyes showed a clear surprise. “Oh... that, what's the matter?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sorry, My mobile phone is lost, I can't contact my friend, can you --"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, is one hundred enough?" I took out the wallet and handed a red banknote to her. At the same time, I brought a hint of regret in the tone. "If you are deceived, you will be deceived. But you are dressed up, and the leader is also worth the money." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis's smile suddenly became a lot stiffer. "No, I just want to borrow a call from your mobile phone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man stunned, only then realized that he had made a mistake and handed the small box in his hand and apologized to both. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Felice shrugged and pressed a series of numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book has not yet figured out the clues at the moment, I don’t know what to say, I have to insist on standing still, but my heart is particularly nervous. The world that she is familiar with is really too different, and the strong sense of strangeness is everywhere, as if a wall is so overwhelmed by her. A lot of people around have noticed the two of them, and they haven’t covered their eyes and swept them here. There are many people who are malicious. This makes her reluctant to think of those exposed to the people during the co-help period. sisters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, all they can do is just look at it." Felice seems to have noticed her uneasiness, and she comforted her head. "You just have to lick." Going back, they are retreating faster than anyone else."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, the little box heard a beep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, is Felice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the voice of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the book felt abruptly relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a dream world, and it’s not far from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfamiliarity still exists, but not as suppressed as before, even with those naked eyes, no longer the initial embarrassment and discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book took a deep breath and followed the look back. As Felice said, people shunned their eyes and opened their hearts with guilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd on the street seems to be re-flowing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s me, the lady of the book is by my side. The address here is... yes, that is what it is displayed on the map. Is it only two kilometers from the community? That's great. Yes, I will wait for you here, oh--brother." After the call ended, Felice lost the small box to the young man, "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felice casually reported a string of numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man was able to record it with great enthusiasm and gratefully bid farewell to the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The small box that you borrowed just now, is it difficult to make a radiotelephone that can be crossed over thousands of miles?" asked the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, the world’s technology has made wireless phones popular in everyone’s hands, not just talking, but also locating directions and finding information, if not It’s almost impossible to do anything,” Felice explained. “Because of this, just write down the number and you can contact each other at any time. If you encounter someone who doesn’t want to take care of it, just refuse or just report a number.”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that." The book is stunned. It’s no wonder that if the two are really in the same world, they will soon be able to meet again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's you, adapting faster than I expected, and it is worthy of being a mentor of the Witch Alliance." Felice smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book shook his head slightly and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows where her courage comes from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s obviously a king, and there’s no progress like before. It’s going to say that the king’s protection of this kind of thing is probably only Roland’s One person? Really, how long will he have to become a qualified monarch? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are also, from the beginning of the support of the Communist Youth League, you should stand in front of the king, but until now, she is still accepting the other’s asylum, which is really called Not a qualified performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... everyone is like this, it doesn’t feel bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, let the status quo last for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, look at the two people over there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is a medieval robe Are they playing cosplay?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Say, the two are really beautiful!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I don't feel much worse than the stars..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a whisper from time to time, the book is no longer uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately ten minutes later, a round-shaped vehicle parked in front of two people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Long wait." His majesty came out of the cab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get on the bus." Felice opened the door and pulled the book into the car. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a group of people followed the crowd’s unbelievable eyes and disappeared into the traffic of the main road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our luck is really good," the spirit of the co-pilot came back. "The book's field docking point is only two blocks away from the package." If you fly, Falcon's flying insects can monitor the area for twenty-four hours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falph nodded, "I have been here before. Cleaned up, and now there are no signs of new demon activity, security should be guaranteed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So fine." Roland laughed, "then As the first witch who entered the dream autonomously, how is your feeling at the moment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this the vehicle of the dream world?" The chair knocked on the window again. "The seat is softer than the sofa. It is quiet and silent, and the speed is so fast. It is much better than a steam truck... If we can make such a high-end carrier How good the tool is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, she suddenly felt that Roland’s smile was somewhat Solid, three other divine punishment witch also says pursing his mouth, seemed to endure something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
