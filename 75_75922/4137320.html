			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understanding too little...?" Seren’s body must fall down and it seems to be quite touching. "Indeed, the longer I will stay in the Quest." The more I feel that I know very little. The books that you brought back from the world of dreams have opened my eyes. Listening to you saying this, maybe I should not use incredible to describe it - because there is something like It's incredible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our." Celine chuckled. "According to the book, aren't everyone made up of a bunch of elements? Carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, etc... and the tree is not much different. But we can cry and laugh. It’s much more magical than illuminating.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I’ve seen that book, but it’s hard to believe.” The night sighed, “a little bit I don't want to admit that the skin on my body is not much different from the rough bark."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is probably the knot under the arm. . The secret of "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Celine look to Roland, he did not then. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"陛下?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, what's wrong with you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland came back at this moment, "Cylin, what was the sentence you said before?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We are even more magical than the stone tablet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is this..." He felt an idea in his mind. "The so-called stone tablet, will it not be? Who is placed there to be a product of commemoration, but are they the stickman itself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean--" Celine's voice was a little surprised . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The stickman is the stone tablet. What we have seen is the body they left behind." Roland replied with a word, and the body could not stop playing. A spirit. Yes, a new, life-like body that is completely different from carbon-based organisms – silicon-based organisms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, he did not think of this aspect, but once the idea emerged, not only some of the characteristics of the "Glowing Stone" itself can be explained, in the temple The remaining murals also have a deeper meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, why are there so many lines on the monument? It's not just the surface, it's the same inside - if it's all carved out with tools, even Anna, who is awakened by the black fire, can't easily do it in a short time, let alone according to the discoverer's dictation, every stone monument This is the case. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think about it from a different angle, it’s not surprising that those are grown by themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may have been "blood" in the lines, and under the pressure of blood, silicon oxide has a localized piezoelectric effect - and these The electrical signals are mixed together and eventually form a mind. In addition, current can be converted into visible light through some mechanism, so they have the ability to communicate with the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can’t help but think of the huge fit of the stickman on the mural and the lake where the blood flows...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp From the standpoint of stability, oil is naturally more suitable than water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further thinking, the biggest enemy of the stickman, the radiographer, may not be adoring the radioactive material for no reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong radiant energy can interfere with the circuit and even cause "electronic devices" to fail - this may be the source of radioactive beliefs! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland seems to have seen a stunning picture in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two very different civilizations in order to compete for the relics of the gods in the extreme south of the final battle, a completely annihilated, the blood of the formation constitutes the underground river With a throat swamp. However, because the body is not rotted, it still exists as a tombstone buried in the ground after the millennium. The other party won the victory, but it was lost but disappeared. Except for the remains of the caged mountains and the rituals, the disappearance was more thorough. Later generations can only guess the history that has happened through a few vicissitudes of murals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
