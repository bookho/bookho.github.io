After the war, live The trial warrior who came down even gave 66 her food and clothes for a while until the army returned to Hermes, and they bid farewell to the hero. Before the trip, all the trial warriors who had been in that cage came. She expressed her gratitude."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the frowning, "Can the title of heroes be..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a hero," Anne said. "No matter how the city people who have been cured by her treat her, she has saved tens of thousands of people in Wolf City and saved me and Amy. Life. This title, she deserved it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambassador could not help but sigh, the wounds of this group of witches have been much more cruel than they thought. If you change it to be treated like this, don’t say that you believe in ordinary people, even if you regard everyone as an enemy, hate All have a clean kill normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unpleasantness of the other party’s suspicion has gradually dissipated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Her legs...maybe have a chance to recover."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, you said Is it true?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What do you do?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people look at the same Going to Joel, even heroes are no exception. Looking at her appearance, she may be only ten years old. Even if she was devastated by the war, her eyes are still full of expectations, not numbness and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, I am not sure," Joel licked his nose. "Hill once mentioned that the witches gathered in the Grey Fort are likely to have passed. Three hundred people, and the power of the devil... No, I mean that this kind of thing is always strange, right? Maybe someone can make a broken limb reborn, or simply give her a new one." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three hundred?" On the 76th, he was surprised. "How did the King of the Grey Fortress attract so many witches?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a long story. My old friend is a born king. He has already seen the church's tricks. He not only stipulates in the territory that witches can live like ordinary people. It also promoted the witch's sinlessness to all parts of the gray fort. After a long time, naturally there will be many witches who will vote for him and work for him." About the opportunity to tout Roland, "So you are completely You don't have to worry about your future life. The winter city without you says that everyone can find a suitable job, and the witch is no exception." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of work?" Amy's eyes sparkled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know... I have never been to the Winter City. "Oh, of course, you have to look at what kind of abilities you have, such as manipulating the flames." Blacksmiths, who control the whirlwinds, go to the mill to push the windmills, and so on.” Joel said, “In short, your Majesty’s plan to establish a new king capital in the West will require a lot of manpower. Even if the ability is not useful, it can be like ordinary people. "Work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds really good," Amy squinted at the words and stops. "But lie is always better than reality." Much more, I am now..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know that I know, you can't fully believe me, right?" Joel said, "I believe it by the time." Your own eyes are fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, how do you know the hero?" asked on the 76th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the Heart City was captured, I happened to be in Amy’s house, because I noticed the strange actions of the trial army, I found it along the group. "The hero." Annie said as she slammed the bonfire. "It was a few months after the broken blade. She was caught by the church believers who were stationed and planned to go to the holy city. I laid the squad on the road in advance. Save her out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you alone?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
