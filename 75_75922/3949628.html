			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the illusion disappeared, the hall was caught in a strange silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, the book grew a tone. "It’s no wonder that your second sister will be intimidated. This scene is indeed... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ability to produce group illusions is rare, but it is not without..." Aegusa said slowly, "I was at the federation." Know that at least two people have similar abilities, one of whom is a high-level witch in the Star City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How many times can you perform this function every day?" Tidy asked, "Can you control the specific time period of the illusion?" According to His Royal Highness, the next step is to test all aspects of the ability to understand its characteristics, consumption and use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably... two or three times," Axia whispered. "What is the time period? Do you mean how long ago you can see?" Seeing the former nod, she embarrassedly touched her head. "I haven't tried it, but the more it seems, the harder it is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter I couldn't help but laugh out. "That's not laborious, but you are consuming the magic of the body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You should be able to feel it, like the water flowing in your body, like a spiral of fog, you need to use it every time you use it," the book explains. "About magic. There are many more features, and we will teach you slowly in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Axia gently nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Wendy let her use her full force to display an illusion, this time the result is almost a day and a half, you can see the lights in the hall The sisters of the Witch Alliance are sitting at the long table for dinner. After that, Axia's magic was completely exhausted, and the girl lowered her arms in a panting breath, and there was a fine sweat on her forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wenty recorded the results of the two tests on the book one by one, as for the purpose... she could not think of it for a while, after all, the illusion can only show the past Things, and can not predict the future, perhaps only after the return of His Royal Highness Roland can make a judgment. Thinking of this, she couldn't help but feel a little frustrated. Her Royal Highness had revealed to her that she intended to turn the Witch Alliance into a self-operating organization, and she would preside over the work. However, she did not have the knowledgeable experience of her Highness, and the application of her sister's abilities could not be considered as comprehensive as he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convergence of the mood, Wendy is preparing to encourage the other two sentences, but the book has made a gesture to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked aside, she whispered, "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Is it going to tell Axia that if you don't want to go home, it doesn't matter if you stay here?" The book frowned. "Are you going to check before you join the Witch Alliance?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Wendi certainly knows that foreign witches can only be regarded as similar in answering ten general questions about identity and origin under the nightingale's polygraph ability. "But Axia is unlikely to make a fake... her ID card is Soroya made it, and the origins are also right. Not to mention that she has just awakened, or a non-combat witch, even if it is a church, it is impossible to predict this."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not only magic that can hurt people, a dagger, a pack of poisons can have the same effect, or even better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No, how can she--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can't deny the possibility," the book interrupted. The check-in is carried out by the City Hall and will not check every family member. The sudden awakening has become the best opportunity to sneak into the castle..." She paused. "Of course I know that this possibility is minimal, but Don't forget, His Royal Highness Roland is the one we can't afford to lose, and now there is still the house of Terry in the Witch Building. In case of her accident, the sisters of the Sleeping Island are only going to break completely with Bianyi Town. Everything will be paid for, so we can't afford it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Wendy is silent, she knows that the concerns of the book are not unreasonable. It is not aimed at the Axia individual, but it is still somewhat unacceptable in my heart. As the first witch who awakened in the town after Roland was the lord, Asha was to be warned as a potential enemy. This contrast is really uncomfortable. After a long time, she opened her mouth. "I know, I will send her back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
