			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sat at his desk and answered the call from the front of the fertile plains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is said that the front line is not completely accurate. In terms of the attenuation speed of the signal, at most, there is no connection between winter and long song. Before the continuation amplifier was invented, this was also the limit distance for hand-phone communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this does not mean that there is no way to break through. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The easiest way is to let the leaves act as "transfers". In the state of the heart of the forest, her consciousness can cover the entire controlled The fascination of the forest means that the speed of the message is transmitted even above the lightning of the sonic flight. The front line only needs to make a leaf, and then the leaf calls to Roland, in a sense, it can be regarded as real-time communication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The current situation is quite smooth," the leaf pressed against the voice, imitating the tone of the iron axe. "As you might expect, the devil will follow the rails." Several destruction attacks were launched, but the impact on logistics transportation was not great. Without the spider magic, they could only be vacant to the vicinity of the orbit, displaced by brute force, and had to evacuate before the Heihe River approached— - Without the need to change rails, the engineering department will soon be able to repair the damaged track."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that the armored train has played its due "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is true, squat. Whether it is mobile rescue or maintenance of the railway, it can be used as a small fortress. The only regret is the train. The number is still too small, and if I can, I want to arrange a group of Heihe between each site."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to get it simple," Roland couldn't help but swear. "In addition to the armored trains, the freight trains have to continue to grow. And this part of the work is still inseparable from the witch, now it is very good to provide two. Continue to advance the front line, and strive to complete the general attack before midsummer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves snorted and replied slyly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually... you don’t have to imitate the nasal sounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland coughed twice. "Right, the devil has not shown any signs of a large-scale attack yet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a night before the night was awakened by the nightingale, when he heard that the first military camp was hit by the night attack, he was really nervous for a while, but Anna told him that the loss was not big, and that Isis was out. After living in the hearts of the people, Roland was relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, fighting in a dull or low-light environment has always been the weakness of the First Army. Failure to observe the target will result in a significant drop in the efficiency of hot weapons. The tracer has never been able to mass-produce, and the target indication relies heavily on the ability of the witch. Unexpectedly, the devil's first active offensive was chosen at night, not only to make Sylvie's magic eyes thoroughly touched, but also realized the nature of the gun attack, taking a distracted formation, and even marching forward. Fortunately, the enemy always lacks the weapons that can be opposed to it, and the first army has performed every requirement in the emergency combat training, otherwise the result is not very good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it’s an attack like the last night attack, there are no signs of it," said the leaf. "Mr. Hillway draws one or two every day." Hours of time to check the necessary places in front of the track, and also occasionally take the Magic Ark or Seagull to go out for investigation, at least so far safe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do the General Staff Department say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They think there are two possibilities. One is that we have noticed our change and can no longer reapply. Second, the devil's strength is limited, and it is impossible to plan two large-scale attacks in a short period of time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Roland thought. In addition to the amazing learning ability of the opponent, the last attack was the most high-order devil as a assaulter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time this has happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
