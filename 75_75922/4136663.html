			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think...we should go." Silence for a moment, Sinbaddi muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This place is full of surprises. The longer you stay, the more you feel depressed. Even if you are on the bottom of the sea, you are not so uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either the soft light under the feet, or the oil lamp in the hand, can only illuminate the range of more than ten steps around, and farther away is dark - In the eyes of Simbadi, this light not only does not bring comfort, but is a dangerous omen. This means that they are completely exposed to the light, but they are ignorant of the threats in the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, until now, neither of them saw the true boundary of this cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go?" Rex’s voice trembled a little. "What are you talking about... I dare to swear, it’s definitely not seen by Thunder adults. The wonders of the past. Ancient relics? No... it is a relic!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The remains will not move, you can come back later," Sinbaddi has shrunk The brain advised, "Your assistant, and the strange things... are waiting for your good news outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mention of the strange things Rexton calmed down a lot. "You, you are right, I should bring this good news back and share it with everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Take it quickly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait...etc, it’s hard to get here, you can’t go back empty-handed.” He pulled out of his pocket A dagger, chiseled a stone tablet. "Reassured, it won't take long. You can also stuff something into your pocket, at least as proof that we did find out."<br /><br />&nbsp ;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In desperation, Sinbad had to do it. After all, the other party is essentially his employer. Since he took over the work of the 20 golden dragons, he naturally has to bear the corresponding risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps this is just a weird look, he comforted himself in the bottom of his heart, the black around is black, but there may be nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“蹭,蹭,蹭—”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex’s every knife Sending a stone-like cicada, this is particularly harsh in the silent cave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddi also noticed that whenever the dagger cuts into the monument, the light from the contact point will be much brighter, even to the point of dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head and pulled his attention back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Simbadi really didn’t have the strength to use it on the cutting stone. There were some weird stone tools scattered in the messy wall, probably carrying The tools left by the people only decayed into the present as time passed. He picked a few pieces and stuffed them into his pockets. As a result, he was able to complete the task of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"蹭,蹭,蹭-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fjords still focus on the monument Body, and he has five or six pieces of nail-sized gravel on hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, these are almost enough..." When Sinbad was about to urge him again, his ears suddenly caught a trace of uncoordinated tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is the sound of 蹭, 蹭, 蹭, but more smashed, as if there are several Rex in the monument...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is... echo? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No! He realized that the position of the two had not changed. How could there be no sound before, but now there is a sudden echo? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rex."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm fine, this is the last piece." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You stop first..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop me!" He almost whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rex couldn’t help but see that the dagger was in the air and the harsh collision stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sizzling buzz still exists and seems to be approaching them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Rex also found out that it was not good. He stuffed the stone into his pocket and looked around and said, "What is that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interrogation, the white light suddenly alternates in the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the light, Sinbad saw the coming - a full-aged desert scorpion. Its pliers have an arm size, and the raised tail crochet is almost waist-high. The green needle tip is undoubtedly filled with poisonous juice. Once it is tied, it can support up to a quarter of an hour without an antidote. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, it must be a chiseling alarm! He bit his scalp and put his waist knife on his chest. "You slowly step back and your eyes don't leave your throat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the outstanding Mokin Warrior, the desert蝎 is not a difficult opponent, their intelligence is low, the speed is not fast, the poison needle is not only the most threatening offensive means, but also its weakness. As long as it is emptied once, the sharp waist knife can break the tail hook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that he is not an outstanding warrior in any way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he has received relevant training since he was a child, he has neither participated in joint hunting nor really fought against the desert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can only try it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rex was completely behind him, he whispered, "Look down now, don't tamper with whatever happens."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the reply, Simbadi also leaned over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the moment when the gaze was out of contact, the desert scorpion launched an offensive - although it was invisible, the scream of screaming indicates that the other party is quickly rushing toward him. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the habit of the desert, and it is an opportunity to look for opportunities in the confrontation. Once the hunting object is found to have scattered flaws, it will attack immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddi bent down slightly, put the knife on the left side, and gently put the handle on the right hand. This is the starting point for the sandman to pull the knife - - It seems that there is no enemy, but the entire area on the right side of the body is within the scope of the blade! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sand crawling sounds almost at the ear, he slams one step and then pulls the knife out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glimmer of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not seen back in sight, there has been a weak resistance in the hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the touch of the blade across the hollow reed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a crisp sound, the tail hooks of the desert smashed into the stone monument have been split into two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddi turned the blade and inserted it directly into the gap of the carapace behind the head of the scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target swayed the lower a foot and weakened it quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great..." Rex sighed. "I don't want to be a Mojinsha people who are hunting for a living..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not finished yet!" Simbadi interrupted. "The voice just didn't come out like a desert!" Where? Where will the enemy appear? He watched before and after the vigilance - there are all kinds of stone monuments here, no matter which direction you come from, there should be light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s only dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
