			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Wendy said, the next morning, the witches were called by the maid to the first floor. After breakfast, the prince handed them a beautiful one. parchment. Considering that some witches can't read the words, the book retells the content for everyone. Followed by the signature, press the fingerprint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows that it is difficult for them to really understand the meaning of each line of text in the contract, but it doesn't matter. It will always be understood after a long time. He also knows that even if they are selling their deeds, they will sign their names at the moment. Roland doesn't think that providing a relatively generous treaty is a behavior that makes him suffer. Since he chooses to follow this path, he must look further. What he is doing now is to form a good cycle in the future, a win-win framework that can be implemented for a long time. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the contract, Roland arranged the training tasks for each person according to the plan that was made last night, and then called the leaves, the books and the Solo. Ya returned to the office with herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close the door, the night owl shows a figure, and the sisters blinked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always thought about what Wendy told me yesterday," Roland opened the curtains and let the bright sunshine shine into the room. "She said that you have encountered terrible The monster, in the end, only seven people survived. Even the helper's mentor Hakala died in the wild. I want to know, what happened to you, mixed species of evil beasts?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaves first said: "Not evil beasts, they are the devils from the gates of hell, have tall bodies, can drive evil spirits, and have magic power, just like..." She hesitated "It's just like us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Devil?" Roland frowned and looked at Soroya. "Are you there?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can draw the scene at the time, right?" Roland handed a piece of paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soloya closed her eyes and looked a little bit painful, but she took the paper and walked to the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ability to display, the ever-changing quill appears in her hand, the pen is flowing with colorful light, then flies out of her hands, on paper Move quickly. A vivid picture gradually appeared on the paper, and Soroya never opened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is close to the table, only to see the pattern on the paper is really incomparable - no, he told himself that this is not a painting, but a real-time shooting of the scene at the time. Her ability, like the same camera, will reappear in the wilderness of the massacre in the first perspective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the painting was finished, Soroya’s forehead was covered with sweat, and it was obvious that this memory was like a nightmare for her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale also brought his head together. "Is this the devil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" It’s them,” the leaf pointed to the closest one from the perspective. “This devil wearing a metal glove can summon lightning strikes, and at the same time, the power is endless, more than a dozen sisters die in his hands. The devil in the distance Can throw a spear several times faster than the arrow. But their special attacks can not be used continuously, I just took the opportunity to kill them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you alone?" Roland asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The skin tube under the evil beast helmet is the weakness of the devil," the leaf pointed at the neck of the iron hand devil, "Hakala's magic snake bites I broke his pipe and eventually died with him. I used the same method to kill the other one by hand. There seemed to be some red gas in the tube. After the gas leaked, they would die."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, how does this look like an oxygen tank-like device? How can there be such a creature in the wilderness? Roland is puzzled. But if they say that they are aliens, they will obviously not reach that level. The sturdy leather tube with patches and the clothes made of animal skin can only be said to be comparable to oneself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether using technology or magic, being able to take the initiative to travel to other planets, it shows its strength - the earth people are faltering even for months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, it is impossible to rule out the miraculous civilization that some talents have squandered. Roland thought, in a nutshell, the "devil" is not an invincible enemy, they can also be killed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
