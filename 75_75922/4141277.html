			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Fort, no winter city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Castle Conference Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the growing office, the halls that were once available are now somewhat narrow, and the main officials in many departments can only move small stools and sit Behind their main and deputy ministers. More registrars and assistants had to stand against the wall, and nearly two hundred people squeezed the room tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems necessary to build a special hall in the castle area to meet the needs of future meetings, Roland thought, this is just no winter city Senior officials, when the managers of other cities in the kingdom came to the new king to report their duties, I am afraid that the first floor of the castle will not be able to fit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After recording this idea on the book, he patted his hands and the meeting room was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Presumably, everyone has already made it clear that the torch operation lasted for nearly ten months has been a complete success. Today our footprint has extended to hundreds of kilometers from No Winter City. In the fertile plains, the threat from the devil was completely wiped out - from this moment on, no winter to the west is no longer a wild land that has been difficult and dangerous, but a fertile territory that can provide us with abundant supplies!" Rolandton Don't raise the volume. "Yes, this plain that is even wider than the four kingdoms will be the main development direction for the future of the Grey Fort!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a thunderous applause in the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of the territory is the most important achievement of the king, and it is also the most easy way for all officials to obtain benefits. Even ordinary people can also be in the big development. Get a piece of it. Now suddenly there is a piece of land that can accommodate several gray fort, and the meaning is naturally self-evident, no matter how much praise can not be overemphasized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am afraid that the title of "Four Kingdoms" will become history in a few years," Barov said with a beard and laughter. "Either in terms of volume and strength, they are far too far from the Grey Fort. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is also true. If history books and biographies are still written as before, I am afraid that they will be jokes by future generations." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about a big three? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Three Kingdoms are too sloppy, and it is more appropriate to have another new title." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agree... I think the empire is very good. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministers eagerly discussed that the atmosphere at the long table was a bit high at the moment.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roland did not deliberately stop it, but set aside a blank time for them to enjoy the glory of the victory before they pulled the topic back to business. "But I hope that everyone realizes that this victory is just the beginning. Not the end! Expelling the devil from the fertile plains has won a relatively safe living space. It does not mean that they will succumb to the demise of humanity. The real threat is the legendary battle of the gods. Only when the red moon is approaching will the enemy reveal all the fangs! For that day, the kingdom must be fully prepared now! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In other words, you can not only relax, but also have to double your strength, understand? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Majesty! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd snarled.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland looked around the hall for a week, then nodded to the nightingale <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter turned and opened the curtain hanging on the wall.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, the location of the map of the Westland was replaced by a huge blackboard, and there was only one word on the blackboard: people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is what I want thing. Roland said one word at a time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western stability, internal government unity, army return, people's minds available, he has too many plans to implement, but no one is more than increasing population More important.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
