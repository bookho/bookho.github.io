			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Luo Lanxing made a big fuss and prepared a long-formed question on how to establish a reasonable market, the horn of the horn came from afar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only when the patrol team can't cope, will the sound of all assembly sounds be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland and Carter looked at each other and immediately stepped out of the castle backyard. The guards had already prepared the horses. He turned over and took the cart and the men under his direction to the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a group of people boarded the city wall, the militia team had each of them, and a row of guns stood on the wall, which made Roland feel a little gratified - so many eggs were not in vain . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked to the northwest, and a group of black figures at the end of the field of vision were approaching the town of Bianbu. The prince estimated the number, about twenty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Iron Axe ran from his defensive position and reported after the ceremony: "His Highness, this group of evil beasts is a bit strange."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strange? Are you saying that they generally don't act collectively?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's not," Iron Axe explained. "If they belong to the group of animals before they fall, they will still maintain this habit after becoming a wicked beast - for example, wolf species, but this group of evil beasts are not of the same species and should not be grouped. Before, hunters observed them. Killing each other."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beast is itself a alienated beast, and the way of doing things mostly maintains the original style of the beast, and the desire to prey is more intense. In a sense, the intelligence of the evil beast is lower than that of the beast, because the arrogant temperament makes them forget the principle of avoiding harm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland carefully observed for a moment and found that the individuals in the herd did have large and small, at least the existence of wolf species and bison species. But this cannot be used as evidence that they suddenly have wisdom and know the importance of the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they are still guided by obstacles and traps placed by the iron axe, they gradually concentrate on the front of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna feels a wet hand, and the position of the grip is somewhat slippery. No one noticed, he secretly wiped his sweat on his clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter in charge of the observation repeatedly said the same thing: "Relax, take a deep breath." Fanna has done countless times, still can not stop the accelerated heartbeat. He has lived in the West for more than a decade, and the most heard is the fierce and cruel deeds of the evil beast. Since the demon moon, some scenes of scattered evil spirits being shot by the Orion under the city wall have alleviated his fear of evil beasts. He thought he was a brave man who had been fighting for a long time. But for the first time today, facing so many monsters, he still feels his legs tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of being selected by his Highness as the team of the pike team, Fanna tried to pretend to be calm and maintain a posture of holding a gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of monsters are getting closer and closer to themselves, he can already recognize their shape, and the front is a bison, two on the head The black-eyed corner is enough for your arms to be thick. The hair that grows on the back is as cloaked as the cloak. When it was only thirty feet from the wall, Fanna felt as if the ground was shaking, and he licked his dry lips and waited for the hunter to make a sniper command. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a loud noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the evil beast did not decrease at all, so it slammed into the wall, and the head suddenly shattered, and the black blood splashed all over the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna still has a sigh of relief in the future, and the two wolves that followed closely have already slammed on the back of the buffalo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"刺!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hunter’s scream came from the ear, and Fanner subconsciously handed it A long gun - although the direction of the wolf is not toward himself. The effect of this attack was obviously not as good as the training. A row of long guns stabbed in the wall. Some people saw the guns spurt out when they saw the wolf jumping, and some heard the slogan still not responding for a long time. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result was that only one wolf was forced to retreat, while the other jumped out of the gap between the guns and landed on the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
