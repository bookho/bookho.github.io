			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s actually an alarm, not an internal treatment of the martial arts association. Is this the last kindness of the other party... After all, the association is not legally bound in a sense Therefore, it also attaches great importance to the behavior of martial arts, and its internal punishment is often heavier than the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Roland smoked his mouth. Now, when are you still thinking about this, no matter whether it is alarm or internal processing? He didn't do anything at all, he had no worries! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, let the other person calm down first--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reporting... Police?" Pretending to be surprised, "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You still ask me why?" Garcia was mad, "How did I tell you before? Awakening Because of the power that they have acquired by chance, they are easy to fall into the extraordinary delusion, thus losing themselves and causing degeneration! Because of this, the martial arts need to be self-denying. I don't want to interfere with your private life. I used to see girls. It’s just a matter of getting out of your home. Adults are all good, but they... they are not yet adult! The enlargement of desire is one of the most obvious signs of degeneration. You still don’t understand!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃... Listening to this, compared to the same three girls, she is actually more angry about her indulgence of desire, and thus embark on a road of no return? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand the truth, but the question is... If I really like you said, why should you bring you to witness the scene?" Roland sighed To breathe, "Do you not think that this doesn't make sense?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "In fact, no matter what I do or do, it is easy to attract criticism. Therefore, the correct approach should be to prevent them from being hit by anyone. I have taken the initiative to let you see them. Don't you think that this may exist?" "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiasia blinked and slowly dropped the phone in his hand. "Why?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Roland secretly sighed and said in the most sincere tone, "This is what I want to explain next. Miss Garcia... I need your help."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, those girls who come out of your room don’t have that relationship with you, but... part-time tutors?" Garcia squinted Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," Roland said calmly. "They are all nearby college students. In addition to counseling Jieluo, they can also teach these three people. But this way It’s not a way to do it. It’s a long time to teach. They will also be suspicious of the identity of the three people. After all, it’s very strange to be there, and it’s really strange to not go to school. I can only change to a new candidate before I teach at home. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been dealing with the problem of deliberate witches. The community has seen that the witches who go out from 0825 are up to three or four. This reason is not Say convincing, at least reasonable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When you first missed the appointment, I mentioned on the phone that 'the family came to the relatives', which means the three?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, that’s all half a year ago, you’re still worried about it now...” Well, they’re not my real relatives, but The same country." Roland was arrogantly nonsense, "Wu En, San Milan, Blossoming and I live in a village, a street. When I left the village, they also played mud at the pond."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these words are placed in the normal world, it is equivalent to "excellent red flag bearer Edison" and "National Tractor Model Faraday" is as weird, fortunately, the dream world blends him and Jieluo Memory, it sounds like there is no sense of violation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why can they not register their household registration?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland just paused for a moment," Because...sex."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It turns out that." Garcia was silent for a long time, and when she spoke again, the eyes of the three men were softened a lot. There are a lot of people like them..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
