			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boat slowly approached the old holy city along the river, the red brick blue tiles of the cathedral appeared a little from the tree shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with the new church on the Hermes Plateau, it looks unremarkable, neither a magnificent chapel nor a towering sky. tower. In terms of single-round scale, it may not be as grand as the church in the four kingdoms. However, in the minds of most believers, this ancient and majestic building, together with the monastery, the military field, and the arbitration, constitutes the god's earthward ascension. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It symbolizes the source of the church and is the beginning of everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isabella sneered at this statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will never know that the interior of the mountain behind the cathedral is the origin of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the old holy city? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just to cover up the scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sailboat arrived at the dock, Isabella lightly walked off the trestle, and the escorts that came to greet could not help but see, "Adult, other pure people?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will arrive one or two days in the evening," she shrugged. "The sire is so anxious, I have to give them some time to arrange the aftermath." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the giants of Jieluo said..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She wants to meet everyone," Isabella interrupted. "Yes, but she didn't say she would meet everyone at the same time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This recall is a bit hard to understand In this way, the church is equivalent to giving up control of the morning sun. Without the supply of liquid medicine, the king will die in an endless long sleep. She did not understand why Jielu had to suddenly change the plan she had set before, and there was no explanation in her will. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is more and more like a real pope, Isabella thinks a little uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she still set off immediately after receiving the order and spent a week working back to Hermes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, do you know what happened to the Holy City?" When she boarded the carriage, Isabella looked back at the guard behind her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The advance army of the church and the Grey Fort Army fought at the foot of the cold wind ridge," the latter hesitated. "The specific situation is still to Jieluo. Ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Does...the advance army lost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defensive no longer Answer, but nodded slightly, then stepped on the war horse, shouted to the coachman, "out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella put down the curtains of the car, doubts in the heart . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no doubt that there must be a large number of gods in this advancement army. Only when the gods have lost their troops will the top of the church be given reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the gods are not immortal, they will still be damaged in the face of some damage. Since the offensive winter, the Holy City 66 has continued to lose nearly 100 soldiers. She thought that Jieluo had become accustomed to it, but now it seems that this is not the case. The question is, how serious is this battle loss, so that Jielu is determined to recall all the pure? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage drove past the lively streets of the old holy city to a camp near the desolate cliffs. It was rigorous and not much worse than the cathedral. Isabella got off the carriage, stepped into a tunnel that was cut along the mountain wall, crossed the iron gate and walked into the mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cold light of the stone prism, the outline of the sacred temple appeared in front of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She led the ban to the top library, pushed the door of the ring, the current pope is standing by the window, looking like a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
