			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Kabbah woke up, his arm was covered with thick gauze. The pain is still faint, but it can be said to be insignificant compared to when it was first sprayed with red fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This made her somewhat surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wound on the arm is not fatal. In theory, it will not be treated for the first time. It is not surprising to put it in the end or simply wait for it to heal itself. After all, the characteristics and importance of the little angels are the content that any newcomer will be repeatedly told. She does not think that the sand people will be treated specially - if it is the one that tends to be bad, there is still a possibility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can the wound recover so quickly if it is not the ability? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a problem...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suddenly has a uneasiness in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May be quick to leave here and return to the military camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Falun is it?" A nurse noticed her move and walked over to see the name tag hanging on the bed. "How do you feel now?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, you can return to the team at any time." She rolled out of bed and pretended to be unwilling. "My friends have died." In the hands of the devil, I want them to pay the price immediately!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please mourn." The nurse nodded. "But before that, you have to go first." Mt. Nana Vain wants to see you on the camp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabbah was shocked. "She... want to see me?" But my injury is almost already-""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know why, but this is what she specifically explained." The other party laughed. "Other soldiers want to see you." I still can't see it. Come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaba looked at the nurse's undefended back and hesitated after a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the level checkpoint, she saw the legendary angel in a tent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of appearance, the other party does match the image of the first army in word of mouth, both petite and cute, the skin is white and red, and a pair of scorpions seem to Not completely rid of childishness, it is the great lady who came out of the noble family at home. It is more appropriate to describe it without the wind and rain. Kabbah couldn't help but have a little luck, maybe things didn't get worse until she expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That...what are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately the first sentence of the other party The words broke all her fantasies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very curious, you are obviously a witch, why do you want to hide your identity and join the First Army like ordinary people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I...I don't quite understand..." Kabbah replied with a hard scalp, and I finally reported this to the above...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your injury." Nanawa pointed her arm. "Although there are many breaks, most of them are caused by sharp sharps. The devil's claws can't do this. I I think it should be a dagger or a bayonet weapon. In addition, I found a trace of red fog corrosion when I cleaned the wound - it will invade the muscles in the lower layer of the skin, even to the bones, only the witch will be hurt. Even if you deliberately It is impossible to falsify the wound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabbah closed his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other party is not the news heard from Trent, and the rules are clear, but there is no room for sophistry. I thought that the other person was innocent and simple, and maybe I could use words or confuse to get rid of it. Now it is just a ridiculous plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, she whispered, "Have you seen a witch who has been eroded by red fog?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanawa grin, "Myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All said that the red fog will cause extremely serious damage to the witch, but no one knows the specific treatment method. I have to personally test it." The little girl said calmly, "If any sister is injured by the red fog." I have nothing to do but I have to regret it for a lifetime." She paused. "Fortunately, as long as it is not inhaling a lot of red fog, or being sprayed on the head, it can be rescued in a short time. So you remember, the next time you encounter this situation, the safest way is to cut your arm immediately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaba is stunned, she Until now, I can't forget how strong the pain is when I was eroded by the red fog. I would never want to try the second time after I experienced it. Listening to the other party's tone seems to be repeated several times. When it comes to this point, Nana's expression has not changed much, and she can't be associated with her slightly tender appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenhouse flowers from the noble family? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't be kidding! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed a long time, now recalling that although she was a goddess, she never seemed to have the upper hand in the negotiations, no matter the opposite is clear water The queen is still a little girl from the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...My name is Kabbah, from the sandstone clan, and the law is just a pseudonym." Kabbah has given up all the struggles and will make his past One by one. At this point, the First Army is no longer likely to let her stay, and because she once played for the great enemy of the Grand Chief, the three kings of the Grey Fortress, Garcia, it was not unexpected to be sent back to the Winter City without trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland.Wampton insists on being kind to the witch, but does not mean that he will be kind to the enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am very curious, in the battle of the wolf heart, how did you fool the church pure?" asked Nana Va. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Instructives can be used to command others in addition to being able to command others. If it is just a person, it can even do something beyond its limits. Death is also one of them.” Kabbah sighed slowly. “After receiving the instruction, the breathing and heartbeat will temporarily stop. At that time, the Pure and the Judges were still chasing the Wolf King, and did not waste too much time on me. "The body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The original, the scar on your face was left at that time?" Miss Pine said indulge. "I don't quite have it." Understand that you said that you joined the First Army for the remnant of the tribe. Why do you still have to hide your name? Do you even tell the clan if you live?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I What can you say? Take everyone to fight for a permanent oasis, but in the end, I am only living alone?” Kabbah revealed an unspeakable bitterness. “They trust me and hope, and I put them. Become an irrational monster. Thousands of young Zhuang people died The country, the sandstone clan, was almost swallowed. What other faces did I return to the tribe?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The First Army recruited people in the sand people to make me realize The only compensation that I can make is to join the army and then use the merits obtained in exchange for the green space for the people to live. The review of the sand people is not as strict as you are, I made up an identity, and in the encirclement of the raging and the bone-cutting clan I got Brian’s trust.” She bowed her head. “As for how you should deal with me, but... please don’t anger to the sandstone clan’s head. The rest of the family are children and women and children. They Didn't play for Garcia Wimbledon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand," Nana Wa nodded. "You go back."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Kabbah failed to respond. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am looking for you to actually ask you if the scar on your face should be removed." The little girl spread her hands. "But now, you Is the answer yes? If so, then I have nothing to say."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her mouth and didn’t know what to pick up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, she never had the upper hand in the negotiations, and she was often said to be speechless when she was dealing with the Red Sea Queen, just like now. ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the feelings of the two are so different. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, the Star Flower Troupe has a show tonight, in the camp of Xiqiao," Nana Wa laughed. "If you are back now, Maybe you can see the end."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
