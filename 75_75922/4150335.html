			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intelligence room can be said to be the largest and largest organization in the First Army General Command. In order to screen and store the vast amount of information, Lian and Fran A separate underground space was opened for the staff to use, and 70% of the nearly 200 staff officers worked here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is also the office with the most resource consumption. It is not only equipped with a rare magic stone, but also a free supply of chaotic drinks for refreshment in the middle of the night. Other departments are extremely envious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the interior of the intelligence room often complains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Northland Pearl launched the spy plan, the results have gradually appeared. The secret letter from Yongdong and Wolfheart is from two or three times a week. Nearly one hundred days to now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the staff was at the establishment of the analytic intelligence was its main function, at that time most of the intelligence came from investigation and investigation and war report, not just the rules Concise and concise, and most of them have traces. However, every day, the news of the past hundred is all inconsequential, and even the wording of the phrase is a problem. It takes a lot of time to understand the true meaning, making the screening process like a cumbersome jigsaw puzzle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course this is not the worst. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Processing a secret letter is the most headacheatic issue than reading an analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, the ever-increasing number of messages is counterintuitive. After all, the devil is now blocking the red fog border, and it is not so easy to pass on intelligence. After Hill Fox took over the spy supervisor, the means of transmitting intelligence became more diverse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the inside of the hide, or put into the sling, or simply stuffed in the belly of the salted fish... as long as the nobility of the occupied area does not stop Trade can't stop the news from coming out of the enemy's occupation. Even most of the time, even the sender does not know that he has become part of the intelligence chain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But because of this, the secret letter can be described as diverse, for example, the feeling of picking up the fish from the belly of the fish is definitely not good. Not to mention the need to endure the odor and clean it, and then check it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you work day-to-day with a leisurely afternoon tea and write a report, you will find a variety of garbage-like items. Letters, and then restore them into useful information, anyone will complain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even then, complaining is complaining, but no one dares to be lazy - after all, this department is also the most valued institution of Isis and Iron Axe, in two The dragging in front of the team is undoubtedly a dead end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the intelligence room, Beidi Pearl saw what the iron axe was talking to Hill Fox, and there were dozens of notes in the middle of the room. Obviously, the information that the staff member re-transcribed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She roughly scanned it and found that most of the news came from the Kingdom of Yongdong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large part of them are such as "A city in the north of the city has more than one demon army stationed today", "some nobles are inexplicably dead, their title is by a certain It is difficult to see too much valuable information from such a piece of news, such as a succession, and a huge live rock monster in the direction of the border. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not surprising that the spy plan has progressed so quickly that apart from the merits of opening Hill, it’s inseparable from money laundering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since she suggested taking the initiative to contact the black card sender, the person behind the scenes also came to the front desk - although it was only the agent, but still honestly showed Willing to help the Grey Fort. The organization originated in the morning sun, and has a certain influence in the wolf heart and the winter. Of course, this influence is mainly manifested in the underground black market and mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is the information collected by the mouse, its quality will naturally not be high, perhaps there are still many street rumors and fallacies, just how low It is also much better than the previous black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are a few that have caught her attention. That is, there have been reports of "strong cruisers" in several places. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
