			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland received a letter from the Duke of the North, Calvin Kant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a paper signed by a letter with a handwritten seal, which clearly stated the meaning of allegiance in the North. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the letter is trivial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to ask when Roland will hold the throne ceremony, and he is ready to start the congratulations - this is also the practice of each king when he is crowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the question of the new policy - such as how to enforce, the remaining power of the nobility, inheritance issues and the management of the city hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are all expected, and Roland is the last one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke made a marriage request at the end of the letter, and the whole page praised the beauty and talent of her daughter, Itis, whether it was internal affairs or Foreign affairs can be handled in a well-organized manner, and it is the best queen candidate... In this case, Roland couldnâ€™t help but laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you laughing at?" The sound of the nightingale came from the recliner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A funny...father," he provoked the letter, "Look at this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Night of the night from the fog, took the letter paper, looked a few eyes and frowned. "You will not promise him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not Yes," Roland said easily. "I don't need political marriage to maintain the stability of the throne, and I read the letter so badly. I dare not put her in the castle. Otherwise, who is the king still doesn't know." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It sounds like the truth," the nightingale was obviously relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, you just can't believe me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a question of trust, you I know that the witch can't help..." She paused. "After awakening, we can no longer be a complete woman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't think so, Roland shook his head. The inferiority of the infertility will disappear with the progress of civilization, and the appearance, physical quality, and incredible ability brought by the magic will become more and more important. As long as human beings can continue, the group of witches will inevitably rise. Fortunately, they were born in humans, and there is no specific way to stimulate awakening, which makes the integration of the two have an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he intended to use a lengthy discussion to discuss his point of view, a flying messenger flew into the room from the open window, fluttering two wings and falling in the office On the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a yellow strip of cloth tied to its claws - this means that the secret letter comes from the old king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland swallowed the words back, took a fish from the drawer and threw it into the ashes that shook his head, then untied the cloth and pulled it out. Good oil paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the size of the secret letter is limited, the above content is usually very concise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first sentence of this letter surprised him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Morning Palace has been infiltrated by the pure, and its ability can be disregarded by the stone of God's punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Immature gods affected by the witch? As far as he knows, only the supernatural who strengthens the body can do this, in addition to the high-order devil known as the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland continued to look downwards, only to find that the news was more than an amazing one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The great prince Anpei tried to resist, and the guards lifted their swords under the control of the pure."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "The purpose of the church is to stabilize the morning sun, so that you can concentrate on attacking the gray fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Otto all this is Otto. Losey and Oro Tokat, the three families hope to get your help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
