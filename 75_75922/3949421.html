			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dinner, the nightingale took the box back to the bedroom, not waiting to be opened, lightning, wheat, lily and mystery month followed, and two The eyes glinted staring at the carton in her hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Wendy couldn't help but smile. "Want to see what it is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Lily, the three nodded again and again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness!" Lightning muttered, "The wine is not allowed to drink, why not even the gift!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said only to adult witches," Lily sighed. "When you are an adult, ask him if he wants it. And I don't care what it is." Why are you dragging me too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Mystery said, "I only called you, didn't pull you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop, this is not the point!" Lightning shouted, "Mystery In adulthood, McMug is also an adult, but they are not!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, oh," McMug opened the white hair covering his face and raised The chin protested, "I don't have any embarrassment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...His Royal Highness has his own considerations," the Nightingale felt a little strange, before Roland never Will treat everyone differently, why is this ceremony? People will choose the payment? "Or look at the things inside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the box and see a strange "clothing" that everyone sees - it looks It is composed of several cloth belts and cloth pockets. It is very soft to touch. The material is obviously the fine satin, but it doesn't look like a piece of clothing, because it is too small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a piece of paper underneath," Lightning yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale spreads out the paper and finds the introduction and use of the gift, and the drawing is accompanied by a picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"呃..." Wendy also unpacked her own box. "Is this thing called a bra?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"... can alleviate the weight of the chest, promote blood circulation, stabilize posture, and reduce discomfort when rubbing." The nightingale sound is getting lower and lower, and the cheeks suddenly become hot. This thing is actually used. To support the chest? She couldn't help but look at Wendy, only to find that a group of witches also cast their eyes on her, and revealed a look of ignorance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Lily couldn’t help but laugh. "Now do you know why you don't have a gift? Hey, I correct the previous statement, after lightning, adulthood." It is very likely that there is no such gift."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you will have the same," the mystery moon glared at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not rare," the latter rolled his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this similar to a corset?" Only lightning was completely unmoved, and the eyes were full of curiosity and envy. "Can you wear it for me?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course not!" Wendy rarely showed a sly look. After all four people were driven out, I was relieved. "How could His Highness suddenly?" ......Send us this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale also feels a little embarrassed, just to send close-fitting clothes, but usually everyone wears them from the castle, and No one feels embarrassed. But this is obviously suitable for different people to wear, that is, Roland has carefully observed each person's size before this? This thought made her face red and couldn't help but think of hiding in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, what if you were Anna? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I left, I will be back soon," the nightingale said as he began to fog, walked through the wall, and hesitated for a moment when he walked to Anna’s bedroom door. Choose to knock on the door to enter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door was quickly opened, Anna was wearing her nightgown, and her look was as usual. "What's the matter?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
