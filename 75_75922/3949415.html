			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rainstorm is coming fast and going very fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time of departure of the pedestrians was the second day after the rain stopped, and the ship responsible for sending them to the Grey Fort was just a beautiful woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvi leaned against the side of the ship’s railing and pulled a piece of beef jerky from the bag and swayed overhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"European-------"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; huge seagull accompanied by a tweet from When the sky descended, the airflow caused by the wings made her unable to help her eyes, and the dried meat in her hand was taken away. When she looked up, the seagull had returned to the front of the sailboat and continued to lead in the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what Mai Hao asked her to do, because when she became a bird, she couldn’t find the meat to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although her appearance is no different from ordinary seagulls (except for body shape), Sylvie can see the magic and real form of the surging body. If you look closely, you can also observe that the magic comes from all directions, and it turns into a process in which the spot disappears into the invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that she can not only become a different bird, but also get the corresponding ability?" Someone said behind her, "As far as I know The seagull will never get lost in the sea, and may even sense the coming of the storm in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is true, Mr. Captain," even if he does not look back, Hill Wei can also clearly know who the person is, "otherwise we will not rush to choose a new route, bypass the endless cape and land in the southwest of the Grey Fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Her ability not only observes the flow and change of magic, but also gives her a broad vision without dead ends, and can observe the movement around her at any time - and the obstacles can not hinder the extension of the line of sight, she even You can see the sailors who are lazy to sleep under the deck, and the fish that swims from the bottom of the boat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a port there?" Captain Jack spit out a smog. "I remember that there were explorers who had been to the west of the Endless Cape, but except for the cliffs and shoals." There is nothing there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing is best," Hillmore said. "So everyone can return the same way."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't that a white run?" The captain shook his cigarette rod. "I am looking forward to seeing something different on this new route." What about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trip was carried out by the adult of Tilly, going to another witch gathering place to contact and help each other. In addition to the five famous witches on the ship, there are also ashes and Molly - but they do not go ashore, just to ensure that this flight is foolproof. Molier's magic servant can help the sea ship to withstand the storm, and the ash can make the pirates who are eyeing the ship come back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she also shoulders another duty, which is to identify the true identity of Roland Wimbledon for Tilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before departure, Tilly gave her a detailed explanation of the cause of the incident, and she succumbed to the possible findings and coping styles. In short, It is to reach an agreement with the leaders of the co-sponsor as much as possible, in exchange for the true body of Roland. But to be honest, Sylvie always felt that the task was not so easy to complete. The support would not agree to say that if they didn't want the news to leak out and imprison themselves and the other four people, what should I do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She couldn’t help but sigh through the cabin walls and watching the happy appearance of Lian, Evelyn and other magical servants. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the witches of the Aid are as warm and friendly as Ms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After nearly a week of sailing at sea, Sylvie finally saw the gray Coastline. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are coming," the honey squats on the side of the ship, and she stands next to a row of neat swallows, ospreys and seagulls. Followed by the noise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it finally..." The candle slammed on the side of the ship. "I think I can't hold it anymore."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
