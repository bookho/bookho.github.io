			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis returned to the castle, and the Duke of Calvin was in the middle of the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You only stay in Yongyue City for three days? If I am not mistaken, this task takes time to ferment, and you don't need to go back immediately, why? Don't stay for a while?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She frowned. "Father, have you sent someone to overhear my conversation?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I ask you directly, will you explain it clearly?" The Duke blows his beard and blinks. "This trick is to learn from you - rather than waiting for the answer, it is better than yourself." Go and explore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Northland Pearl couldn’t help but laugh out, "I am very happy, you have made some progress, so I am without winter. You can also save your worries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke didn't have a good air. "You haven't answered my question yet, you just have to go, you still want Bringing Lance together - is that Wimbledon really so attractive to you? But he would rather marry a witch and not want to marry Kant, I really don't understand, put Goron "Whether the child is carrying out the matter!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that you have a complaint against me that I can't get on the back seat," Itis squinted, "still said In fact, you only care about whether my unborn child can take the crown? I have not forgotten how you told me when Fei Keke came to the north; don’t think that I don’t know, you are kneeling. I made any suggestions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calvin’s momentum was suddenly suppressed. “I... I’m just thinking about you, don’t you think, let’s It’s so uncomfortable for the wild woman to come out of this limelight...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Itis sighed secretly, but can’t say that his father is lying, this The sentence is true for her thinking that at least 80% is true, but as far as the results are concerned, that is not a good plan. Calvin Kant may be able to be a good father and can be replaced by a lord in charge of the land. The shortcomings are somewhat obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, this generation of nobles in the North is not very good, or that the level of most nobles is very low, it is no wonder that you do not want to let the aristocratic system continue Continue. In exchange for her coming to be a king, I am afraid I can't accept a group of idiots who ruin their property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because everyone’s level is at a level, she should comfort her father well, but Itis can’t do it. She prefers to turn language into a sharp knife. It is better if it brings pain and torture - whether it is to others or to herself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wild woman? No, you are wrong father, she is not accidental by Gordon Wimbledon." Itis said while giving birth With a hint of pleasure, "The woman lacks only an identity. If she was born in a noble family in the North, it might be much better than you. As for my two younger brothers, it is even more worth mentioning. Facts What you need most to thank is the ancestors of the Kant family. Without the Earl's body, let alone climb to today's seat, even ordinary businessmen on the street can't match it."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she expected, the look of his father became difficult to look at once. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Despite all the unwillingness at the beginning, after making up my mind, I immediately offered those who might harm her. At this point, the woman still It’s a bit decisive. If you assume that Gordon’s child has taken over the authority in the future, do you think she will start with me who has forced her? I think the odds are quite big,” said Itis lightly. “As for the means, Of course, how do you hate how to come, after all, is the woman who knows the most, or is the woman himself?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Enough...I know it is wrong," Calvin finally Can't stand it, raise your hand and surrender, "Can you stop talking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call," Isis is satisfied with the long exit, "so he is absolutely I won't succeed, even if I don't have this meaning, I won't allow it." She licked her long hair and walked to her father. "Say back to business, I don't want to drop too much as soon as possible." The changes are changing with each passing day. It has been a half-month to leave the power center for a long time, if not My Majesty’s account, I don’t want to run this way at all. As for the third brother... I seem to have written it in the letter, and when he is an adult, he will be sent to the Winter City, but your memory is too bad.” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But even if Lance is sent away, there will be no North--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
