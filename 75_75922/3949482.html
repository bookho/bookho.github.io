			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the castle hall, Roland sat back to the main seat and overlooked the people under the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In memory, the Four Princes only exercised the right to a trial when they first came to the town. Later, with the nobility falling out, and the days gone by, he threw all the things in his hand to Barov, never asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the arrival of the people, Roland announced the beginning of the trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the reason for the parties to explain, and then ask themselves - with the secret assistance of the nightingale, he does not need to judge who is deliberately lying, who is not sincere, and does not need A meticulous heart of a dead pupil, it is easy and simple to conclude that responsibility is made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the matter is very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kia Harvey was deprived of his knighthood, and he was unwilling, and he was tired of the cumbersome writing work of the City Hall, and his grievances were all in the fugitives. Body. He used the opportunity to distribute wheat porridge, deliberately charged the fugitives, and provoked the relationship between the two sides, saying that it was because the serfs did not pay all the food, which resulted in insufficient stock of wheat and could not be distributed free of charge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Koya has been charging for several days of porridge, and because he is wearing a striking city hall uniform, the fugitives are worried about retaliation by officials. Most of them kept silent, which made him even worse. To this day, a fugitive named Vader stood up to protest the other side's actions and caused turmoil, which made it all exposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was relieved after understanding the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An organization should be energetic and energetic during the ascent, and although it will inevitably appear to be ** and rigid after stabilization, it should be unified What will happen after the gray castle. If such a problem arises at an early stage, then the organization is destined to go far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it seems that itâ€™s just the personal behavior of Koya Harveys, and there are no more officials involved in the City Hall. And things are limited to extorting money, not the most concerned about the joint serf for food resale and private sale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this pot himself has a responsibility. When the city hall was in short supply, he did not go through any screening and training, just to warn him. All the surrendered knights were given to Barov. The results show that not everyone can accept the job without complaints and bear the huge psychological gap from the knight to the civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland called Barov to his side and whispered: "How will the lord usually deal with this situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp "His Highness, score two situations," the latter replied reverently. "If the perpetrator is a nobleman, after paying a few Golden Dragons, there is no penalty, and the crime of attacking aristocratic civilians can be great." Small, from pickpockets to whipping."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But Koya is no longer a nobleman," the prince shrugged. "I deprived him of his title." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Highness. As a result, the disposition is entirely in the mood of the lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No fixed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baroph shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frowned, all in the mood, its inner meaning is how to impose civilians does not matter, they are not in the eyes of the nobility, it is not necessarily the right eye "people". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In addition to the punishments such as picking up hands, breaking feet, whipping, and pulling nails, are there any common points? For example, imprisonment."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prisoner?" Barov screamed. "You mean to simply shut it up? What kind of punishment? The prison is only a place to temporarily hold the prisoner, and sooner or later, it will be pulled out for trial. If you have been shutting down, you have to supply them with food. I am afraid that in some people's eyes, this is already a reward."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it seems that later generations General's fixed-term imprisonment was not used here. After thinking about it for a while, Roland decided to follow the rules of the Grey Fort. He stood up and glanced across the hall. "I am making a verdict now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kia Harvey, because of dereliction of duty, extortion of fugitives, from From now on, all duties in the City Hall will be abolished, ten years of mining work will be issued, and a fine of three times the income of the extortion will be imposed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
