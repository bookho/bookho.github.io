			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mei shouted and pretended to be smashed by Irene "Your expression doesn't have to be so embarrassing. Although he is a sinister scum, he is still the adoptive father of your role. So you should hesitate to take your perseverance and finally express your peace of mind when you start. Come again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Eileen said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s been half a month since the first performance in the town. She didn’t know why she hadn’t left the place yet, but instead participated in the second drama here. Performance. Today, the crew is rehearsing the third "Witch Diary." From the perspective of the script, this drama is destined to be unparalleled. She still saw such a tortuous story, completely escaping the love between the prince and the princess, the conspiracy of the court rebel, but praising the courage, friendship and belief of ordinary people and witches... even when watching the entire script, She couldn't help but want to cheer for the characters in the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Mey claims to stay for a while. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the real reason, she is not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene will slam the props, and Sam, who plays the adoptive father, screams, "You actually..." Then head to the side, squatting Make a throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly exaggerated, Mayi shook his head. "The part she is tied is the heart. How can you have time to scream and pick up again? It’s okay to catch Eileen’s look. It’s the most common expression of fatal injuries. Didn’t you listen to anything during the drama class!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam's cheeks can't help but red: "Hold... sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go again," she said with a blank expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s that Irene’s performance is somewhat out of May’s expectation, and many details can be corrected quickly if she mentions it once. Whether it is a serious attitude towards drama or a talent for acting, it is considered to be the top-notch group. It seems that the title of the flower of the theater is not completely touted by the actors at the bottom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This time is very good, I will get here today." When the content of this scene was finally clearly expressed, Mey clap his hands, "Filling Should Hilter finish the class soon? You also go home to prepare dinner, after all, what kind of water..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Water," Irene smiled Added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, the tap will be replenished before dusk, and if you eat too late, there will be no water to bathe." Mey coughed two channels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Mey, mainly because the Cavaliers are coming to pick you up?" Luo Xia smirked. "Now there is at least half of the evening. "Times."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that Carter is a close friend of His Royal Highness, and often goes out into the castle and stays with His Royal Highness," said Dinna. "Oh. ... no loss is the most dazzling star in the West, where it is so eye-catching."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are enough," Irene waved, " Miss Mee doesn't necessarily accept the Carter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..." Mey picked a brow, probably because he was not so harsh recently. What? At first, the two men did not dare to breathe in front of themselves, but now they dared to make fun of it. It seems that the rehearsals in the next few days will give them some bitterness to eat. Otherwise, this level is really not worthy of acting on the same stage with themselves. "I am leaving."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your guidance!" Irene and a group of people bowed and bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only a drama instructor who was eligible to enjoy this etiquette, but Mayi did not care. She nodded and left the room for rehearsal, feeling that the hot air outside surrounded her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk to the shade of the community center for a while, a tall man walked over to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Carter Lannis, the knight of the lord of Bentham. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
