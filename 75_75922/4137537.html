			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the lobby, Simbadi is in the middle of the castle courtyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How, is the Grand Chief interested in your diving suit?" Shamin asked with great interest. After a week of getting along, the two became familiar with each other and became half a friend. "What is the reward for discovering the remains? The title of the explorer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex shook his head a little, "He doesn't plan to buy diving suits... ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This...like," Sinbad quickly reacted. "But the Greysburg Kingdom does not need to be normal. After the news is passed, The Fjord Chamber of Commerce will definitely notice your invention. The sea is a treasure chest, this is what you said, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did say this In the words, Rex thought, since the King of Graysburg decided to summon them, it is obviously a matter of special attention to this matter, then according to the terms of recruitment, it will certainly be able to get a generous reward. Both the reward itself and the title of the explorer can attract a lot of attention and topics for him, so that the reputation of diving suits resounds to the fjord islands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled a bit, "The reward for your majesty is a book." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddi stunned. "What do you say?" The sandman bowed his head slightly and his eyes moved to the other's hands. "It's hard... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the case." Rex nodded helplessly. The book is not thick, it is probably dozens of pages, and there is no word on the cover, let alone the beautiful edging and printing. Even if it was given by ordinary nobles, it seems quite shabby, and it is not like a reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a reward is unlikely to bring fame, and if you go out, you may even be ridiculed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big chief shouldn’t be like this..." Sinbaddi snarled. "Even I got the reward of twenty golden dragons, you as a salvage plan." The initiator, it should have been more than I got!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fjord’s straightness made Rex feel a little warm, but he knew It is definitely not worthwhile to use this kind of thing to question a ruler who is in power. Because the other party has already opened the conditions for him to realize his wish, but he is still hesitating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a escort came over. "Your Majesty has prepared a place for you, please come with me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." He quickly squatted and then signaled Sinbad to keep up with himself - anyway, go back and take a good look at the contents of the book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After walking out of the castle area, Rex suddenly heard a strange humming sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s like a series of stunned thunders from the horizon, but it’s even more crisp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snorted softly and looked into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a faintly visible black dot in the blue sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bird? He just came up with this idea and quickly denied his guess. This distance is only a few miles away. What kind of bird can fly like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shamin apparently also noticed this vision, and he was all taut, like a warrior entering the alert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That thing... is coming to us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The enemy?" Xx was surprised, "In the Grey Fortune Kings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know...but it's not something like birds and beasts!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's relax," the guard who led the way but calmly said, "That is just the favorite toy of His Royal Highness Princess, although I will feel it when I first saw it." Unbelievable, but you will get used to it when you stay here for a few more days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty has also advised His Royal Highness not to leave the test flight as much as possible, but she thinks that the venue is too small to be able to display it. Apart from the residential areas, factory areas and whirlpools, there is only one route in the castle area." It’s not strange to kiss, “but I always feel that she is deliberately showing off her skills to her majesty.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still unintelligible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even if it is impossible to understand, Rex has captured a bit of pride from the other side's look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the time of the count, the black spots that are still far away from the sky are already in sight - just in the roar of the roar, the fjords I saw the most incredible scene in this life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two long-winged metal creations ran across his head like a gust of wind, and their shadows were dozens of times larger than the largest seabirds. It is very heavy to see the shape of the body, but it is precisely this heavy iron beast, but at this moment it is flying in the sky. At the same time, he also saw a woman on the iron beast, although it is not really true, but it is indeed carrying people flying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fan...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rex suddenly jumped out of the name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wonder Club is not a well-organized association. He does not have much contact with each other. He only watched it on the day of publicly verifying the flying wing. To be honest, he even has a bit of a hatefulness, because his unrealistic reverie, resulting in a reputation that is not high, will become even worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now someone has completed this feat in a more exaggerated form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the wings of the castle, the wings of the iron beast, his heart picked up a huge wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards brought the two into a building called the "Diplomatic Building" The hotel, leaving a sentence, "My name is Sean, if I think about it, I can come to the Castle District to tell me the answer." Then I turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddi is still immersed in a huge shock, and he will recite the gods of the Three Gods in his mouth, and then he will go to the window and look out. I don't know if I am afraid or I want to see the incredible creation again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex locked himself in the bedroom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at the uncharacteristic book in his hand, as if he wanted to see his thoughts through it, after a quarter of an hour, he opened it. Cover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this quarter of an hour, he made various assumptions, from ordinary biography, eulogy to the introduction of the customs of the city without winter city, or disguised as a book The superior contract of the appearance, even the threat notice that forced the members of the Wonder Club to move to the winter -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first page only says one sentence, the law of buoyancy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An object immersed in a stationary fluid is subjected to a buoyancy equal in magnitude to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, in a direction that is vertically upward and through the centroid of the discharged fluid . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, it seems to be very sloppy, and after several times in my heart, Rex has gradually widened his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly flipped to the second page, which was actually a full-page arithmetic. Probably considering his comprehension, each formula comes with detailed annotations. The more he looks at it, the harder he is to look away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume, Density, Buoyancy... These concepts are no strangers, but they are familiar, but at the moment, he sees them like the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each word is no longer an abstract expression, but a number with a unit; an object is a sinking or floating, to what extent, to mention a pen You can know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex was in retrospect with the steel ships and hydrogen balls sold to the fjord - they seemed to be real and clear in memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterwards, it is a submersible that can rise and fall autonomously. Although it is only a concept map, it is undoubtedly feasible to cooperate with the previous formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
