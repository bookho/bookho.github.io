			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Andreia!" Camilla shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, I know--" Andrea quickly took the gun and closed her eyes, leaving all the distractions behind. Undetected, undetected, undetected... After meditation in her heart, she opened her eyes sharply! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flash, the horizon is suddenly distorted, and there are countless ghosts in front of everything. They stretch, overlap, and extend toward the distance - that is The perception of the magic eye is pouring into her brain, and the layers of the tree that should be blocked are emerging from the earth, and the locked world becomes open and free. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there is also the consciousness of Sylvie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ghosts in the eyes are completely condensed together, her gaze has followed the other’s thoughts and cast a few kilometers away – the guy wearing dark armor The familiar figure was in her eyes. More intense than vision, it is the magic of the demon scorpion, the latter from which it shines out, and is as rich as an entity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I don’t know if the skeleton’s rout is too sudden, or that Tacula’s fall is too big, and the demon will fly straight in the air, There are no guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the situation?" asked the ashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The demon...not aware of us!" Andrea replied in excitement. "It flew over the supply line - although the position was a bit Some are on the east, but still within the range of the gun! Captain, there is no better chance than this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eddy nod, put that The huge gods were thrown into the barrel and then pushed back to the bolt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About eight to nine kilometers, the wind is northeast, there is no other devil interference, this is already the most ideal situation. Andrea focused all his attention on the goal and held his breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless lines that flock out and gather on the demon. They have hundreds of turns and some ups and downs. It’s hard to imagine a bullet. Draw such a strange trail - but soon, most of the lines are dimmed, leaving only a silver curve that is brighter and brighter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found the coin that must be upwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the magic in the body is also rapidly declining, she does not have much time to hesitate, the only chance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia clenched his teeth and pulled the trigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a deafening blow, she felt that the shoulders were hit by heavy objects, and the whole person fell backwards. The ashes on the side were prepared and pulled her into the arms with one hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to be held by you like this." Andrea took a slap in the mouth and relaxed her body - at the moment her shoulders were almost numb. It is like losing consciousness. Even if you don't have to look at it, you know that the clothes are definitely red and swollen. If you don't have Nana's treatment, I am afraid it will take several days to recover. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the burden of the big caliber, even if it takes a variety of buffers including the muzzle system, the remaining impact can not be underestimated. When the weapon was tested, she noticed that even if she made more sacred bullets, there would be no chance of a second fire—whether it was the magic capacity, the body level or the load of the ark, which limited her play. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s the ability that she is most proud of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a return to the enemy, and it’s bloody, it’s something that barbarians love to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the guy who is pulling her now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't worry about Sylvie's feelings with you at the moment, I don't want to take care of you." Ashes rolled his eyes. "How the result, the devil It--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a second," Andrea made a squeaking gesture, "The bullet is still on the road."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the trigger is pulled, the result is already destined, and the magical warhead will fly the entire path along the predetermined trajectory. The only variable is the target—if the slayer suddenly changes direction, nothing will happen. Twenty-five seconds or so said that the length is not long, that short is not short, the only thing she can do is to silently pray, and send the other party to maintain the existing posture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gusts from west to east continue to push the bullets, keeping them flying at high speeds and moving closer to the devil - in the last few seconds, Andre Yabashi breathed and even heard the prayers in his heart--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't move, don't move, don't move...<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the demon person suddenly turned his head and his eyes met with her! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia suddenly felt that the blood all over the body seemed to solidify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the next moment, the warhead that fell from the air slammed on its back without bias. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge impact of the god stone is divided, from a group of black shadows into a myriad of small pieces, but more completely than the god stone, is the devil The body of the person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for her own eyes, she could hardly imagine that a two-finger-wide stone would be so amazingly destructive. The thick armor was torn like a rag. After the bullet got into its body, it opened a big hole directly in the chest. The flesh and blood and the organs poured out like a turbid fountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the hole is really too big, and the demon tumbling two turns and breaking into two, keeping the speed of the flight to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia has only recovered from the shock just now, she swallowed, "Target...dead."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we successful?" Maggie delighted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Sylvie gave a sigh of relief. "By the bullets split into two, even if Nana Wa is present, it should not be saved." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good job." Ashes patted Andrea's shoulder, and then took out the hearing, "Lightning, called the Seagull. Confluence, the mission is over, we can go back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand," the lightning response came quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sniper rifle was dismantled and packaged as a component in a short time. Only when another squad returned from the east line, everyone could leave. As soon as I thought that I could immediately return home, everyone’s look would be easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only exception is Andrea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire ambush process is normal, just like the plan, except for the one who turned the head of the demon -<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now she can still feel the coolness behind her for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it find that you are watching it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but how is this possible? Eight or nine kilometers apart, and there is a jungle, to find them in this situation, is tantamount to looking for a needle under the sea. What's more, the other side did not have any "find" action before, but suddenly pointed her eye at her, as if she had known her here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sylvie should have seen this scene right, why didn’t she feel anything different? Or, she thinks that it is just an accident, not worth thinking about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably also, after all, the demon is dead... a dead devil, no matter what the idea of ​​the moment is, it is gone. The need for further investigation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andreia licked his forehead and his fingers suddenly stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembers that her face has been hurt in the ashes - to protect the leaves, and to stay with the demon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, like a slight injury such as scratching the epidermis, how long will it take you to recover by your own resilience?" Andrea looks out to the supernatural . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
