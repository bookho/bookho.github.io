			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress's castle study is much more spacious than the town office. The tall bookcase occupies the left and right walls, and the edges of the cabinet are inlaid with gold-plated metal edging. It is full of all kinds of books. Look down all the way, from talking about epics to historical travels. In order to facilitate access to the top books, there is a wooden escalator on the side of the bookcase. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably for safety reasons, the only window in the study is only half a person high and has an iron railing attached to it. When the light is shining into the house from the outdoors, it is clear that a narrow beam of light is scattered on the old plush carpet, which is quite independent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s Anna, I’ll love this place, Roland can’t help but think, for him, it’s still a floor-to-ceiling window, and the room is always bright. The town office is more in line with your own wishes. Even if it is small, it is full of comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the nightingale, seeing how often she sleeps by the fireplace, she knows how much she doesn't like it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a knock at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Come in," Roland put the "Secretary of the West" in his hand back into the cupboard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness," Pedro Hermon walked into the study and placed a stack of white paper on the table. "The statistics you have made me have been completed." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland returned to his desk and looked through the list of aristocratic statistics he had handed up. "Is this all the nobles left in the West?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes," Peello briefly explained. "I divided them into two categories, guilty and innocent, and then sorted by family name. Guilty There were a total of 64 aristocrats who refused to participate in the rebellion, or 137 who were unaware of it. The latter were mostly free knights, jazz and small nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland opens the top page of the list, and the first place is the Earl of Maple Leaf, Roman Candi. Listening to the report of the iron axe, the big aristocrat was hidden in the casks of the basement after being destroyed in the mansion. When the first army soldiers searched out, even the pants were scared. He was also the highest in the battle of reunification. Insurgents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next page is the nobles of the Maple Leaf family, such as two sons, other relatives, and the divided knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland quickly turned to the end, then satisfactorily folded the statistics, "Good job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In general, the six major families in the West have become history - the Lions Ryan, Maple Leaf, Ben Wolf and Wild Rose can no longer have the opportunity to turn over. Although the honeysuckle and the elk remain, they are no longer It is a land-based aristocrat in the past, and all the power of the West will be attributed to him alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness..." Pei Luo hesitated for a moment before saying, "The guilty and innocent rulings on the list were provided to me by Mr. Axe. No... There may be a misjudgment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but chuckle twice. "He is very good at the trial, and he has not been tortured, so I think the final ruling can still be believed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, this is just a scorpion. After all the captured aristocrats are placed in the dungeon, they are responsible for the nightingale. I have identified it once - just ask a few simple questions to see if the other person is involved in the rebellion. This is also the reason why Roland dared to clean up the nobility. With the help of the nightingale, he can truly not let go of a bad person, nor a good person. I don’t play the same set of plants, and I don’t pretend to be enlightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That...what are you going to do with these sinful aristocrats?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's wrong, Roland looked up and swept Pelos. "Is there your friend inside?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Your Highness," the latter shook his head, "I Just thinking, if you kill them all, it may be detrimental to your future rule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You also asked for blood debts a week ago," Prince Rao I raised my eyebrows with interest. "Do you want to let them go now?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
