			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all is over, the second team is late. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put the mud on his face, then tore the clothes out of the mouth, pretending to be as weak as other people, lying on the ground, waiting for the martial arts Association of rescue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the exuberant curiosity makes the spirit make a big mistake, but unfortunately fortunately, she only imitated the "key press" step, but not The channel is replaced by the team communication mode. Therefore, at that time, when I heard the knockdown statement, only Fiji was cold. Not to mention that she is still in a coma, even if she wakes up, Roland can firmly deny it and put these ridiculous slang words into the illusion of serious injury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why the monster disappears without a trace, it is naturally impossible for him to "go long past". Although this is equivalent to giving up the merits of repelling the enemy to the genius girl, but in the eyes of Roland, it is a must. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After what he expected, his ambiguous description did not attract the attention of the liaison officer without witnessing the battle. The focus of the association is entirely on the new erosion - even the 12-person main battle team only survived six people, including the sacrifice of two star martial artists, the amazing news of "man-made erosion" It’s nothing in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that surprised Roland was that after the second team arrived at the scene, Garcia jumped into the pit first - seeing the other side anxiously shouting His name rummaged at the bottom of the pit, and the joy of discovering him without disguise, made him feel a warmth involuntarily. Of course, this kind of movement did not last long. Garcia quickly changed back to the indifferent face, whispering a whisper, "What, you are not dead yet," and dragged him to the ambulance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, the joint annihilation mission has finally come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the building, Felice and others expressed concern about the warnings of the magic creatures. After all, the enemy’s last words were really shocking and not Like the letter of mouth - the first time to find Roland's anomaly is a proof. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was a year ago, Roland would indeed consider the other party’s warning of “Don’t enter here again” – for a while, he gradually became more complicated. And the increasingly strange world of dreams is full of vigilance and resistance, just like something originally born of his will, just a little bit out of his control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, he has already made a decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of dreams is not just a tool for his lack of knowledge. For the god of witches, this is a truly complete place. He may not be able to keep the world alive, but before that day, he hopes to make more pleasant memories of the Tacula survivors who have lost most of their feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And another reason is that he believes in his feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect, the initial subtle changes in the dream world may have started with the release of the first core cyclone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Roland has not solved the relationship between the two, but when he defeated the magic creature and took away its astrolabe, the feeling of sudden emergence in the body suddenly appeared. It is real. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a hunch in his heart. As long as he continues this way, he will find the answer one day. In addition, the end of the mission does not mean the end of the incident. It is conceivable that the news of using the infected core to create erosion will cause much sensation within the association. After the martial arts have awakened, the association will gradually restore the whole process of the conspiracy from multiple angles, and the corresponding investigation will continue for a long time. He will also be affected to some extent, even being suspected and even hostile by the new faction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in any case, that is all about the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, the detectives and the group finally returned to the Winter City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Axia not only traces the entire process of the Tajila decisive battle, but also records several important fragments with time stamps. Roland, who got the news, summoned the high-level participants to the third side of the city hall for the first time, and watched the beginning and end of the battle in a personal experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
