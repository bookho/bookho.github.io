			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Camo Stern returned home, the sky was completely dark . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner with his family, he returned to his study and wrote the crystal recipe and selection of crystal glass into his own work - Alchemy The Gates, which records his journey from the apprentice to the chief alchemist, also includes all the alchemy formulas summarized in the Chishuicheng Alchemy Workshop over the years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo believes that with this book, he will be named in history, even after thousands of years, those alchemists will also name his Deeply remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the candle flame approached the base, Kemer put down the quill, ready to undress and sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he remembered that there was still a letter from the prince that was not dismantled, and that only the candle with the length of the fingernail was left, he decided to use the last time. After reading this letter, I will verbally reply to the messenger tomorrow - the small half of the candle tail is enough for him to write dozens of words, but enough to read a worthless letter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unpacking the envelope, there are three thin sheets of paper inside, the first page is a common guest, introducing your title and territory, and Kemer even doesn't bother to look at it. Jump directly to the second page. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the second page made him a little surprised. It was neither a recruitment nor a reprimand, but a strange pattern of five lines. If you look carefully, each line The children are composed of three sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, it’s a bit interesting, he smiled, no matter what the purpose of the prince is, at least it would be a mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swept the first line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nitrate retorting produces nitric acid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salt stone...dry distillation...acid, are some Alchemy terminology. Wait a minute, Kemo’s heart suddenly stunned. Isn’t this one of the double-stone acid methods in the Alchemy Square? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acid that is distilled from the saltpeter must be collected in a special container and looks the same as ordinary water vapor, which is difficult to attract attention. But it is very corrosive, not only can ablate the skin, but even dissolve some metal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This...is it actually an alchemy formula? Is it difficult to get into the town? There is also an alchemist? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly moved his gaze to the next line--<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the first sentence lets He was amazed, and the second sentence was incredible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It consists of a bunch of inexplicable symbols that are juxtaposed together and emit two equations. Kemer frowned, he had never seen such a weird symbol. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further down, the third sentence seems to be an explanation of the second sentence, including the names and meanings of those symbols - to be honest, he still does not read after reading I can understand that the words of those mouthfuls seem to be words of creation. He needs to read the words many times in order to associate words with symbols. However, the meaning of the whole sentence still makes him unable to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the flame of the candle swayed twice and went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell! Kemo snorted in his heart and took a candle out of the drawer without hesitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second candle burns to half, the chief alchemist holds the stationery The hand is shaking slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that there is nothing in the letter, but it takes several times more than normal reading. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five-line style on the second page of stationery is actually an alchemy formula! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, an outstanding alchemy master, it is not unthinkable to sum up the five formulas by personal strength, but these five formulas, Except for the first method of acid production, they all echo each other. The recurrence of certain vocabulary words constitutes a seemingly balanced cycle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver nitrate reacts with iron to form ferrous nitrate and silver."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Silver nitrate reacts with copper to form copper nitrate and silver."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Copper nitrate reacts with iron to form ferrous nitrate and copper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver rod is placed in acid to react to alchemy It has also been done that some of the silver rods are clearly dissolved by the acid and disappear into the invisible - this is the characteristic of the acid, which corrodes everything. Credible, but vowed to say, because silver nitrate is dissolved in water, the surface seems to disappear, in fact, silver is only in another form, not annihilation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No...Cairro shook his head, apparently the other person also expected his own ideas. These formulas echoed each other not by chance. He realized that the other person was verifying himself. Opportunities – whether silver, iron or copper – are common minerals. If the alchemy is carried out according to the following formula, those silvers can be replaced again to prove that it is not annihilated, but still exists in the acid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the neatly arranged formula on the paper, he feels that his breathing has become difficult - if these alchemy formulas are true, they have been for many years The accumulated experience, the efforts of the peers, and the "Alchemy Gate" in writing are just a joke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You sleep with your child, I go to the alchemy workshop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his wife's surprised look, Kemo put on his jacket and rushed into the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he arrived at the Alchemy Square, he immediately called three disciples to tell him that he would conduct an alchemy test and let them order the torches and candles. The more the better. The order was quickly executed, and his long table was illuminated by fire. The disciples shuttled between the material room warehouse and the refining room to prepare test materials for the chief alchemist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a lot of acid in the saltpeter distillation, and the verification can start directly from the second line formula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took some acid and poured it into the glass, then placed the silver rod. As the reaction begins, the body is gradually corroded, accompanied by bubbles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an anxious waiting process, Kaimo unfolded the third page of stationery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one short sentence: "I just did a little work, I want to know more answers, come to the town."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn, this sentence is written equal to not writing! If you can really verify what is said on the letter, he is going to see the unknown master of alchemy. Otherwise, I will sleep hard in the days to come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the bubble no longer emerges, he takes out the broken silver rod and puts a small piece of copper into the cup. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incredible thing happened. The surface of the copper piece soon showed a little white shift, like the shell of a ladybug, the white spot grew bigger and bigger, slowly covering the whole copper. The film, and the acid in the cup also changed from colorless to blue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same as described in the letter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The white precipitate is silver, and the newly formed material copper nitrate is as soluble as water as silver nitrate, but its solution is blue." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo Stoll looks at the results in the cup and stays in place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, when Chamez came to the alchemy workshop, he was The chief alchemist with double black eyes and a stunned face was shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you not sleep for one night yesterday?" He was amazed, "for the second batch of crystal glass?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cemo shook his head and pulled Chamez to the long table and asked tiredly: "You used to be my favorite disciple. I want to ask, what do you think of alchemy?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh...just like the ones you taught me," he noticed that there were some glasses on the table, several of which were filled with different colors. The solution, which has a cup of sky blue, is very eye-catching. Is this the reason why the chief adult did not sleep last night? Although Chames was full of confusion, he still replied honestly, "I also feel the same, the essence of alchemy is to find the truth of the world in disorder and chaos..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
