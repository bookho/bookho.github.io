			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the consciousness is connected, the pain all over the body will follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for silence, this has long been a common practice - fighting against the tide of enemies on the battlefield, and then from the Dianchi Lake Wake up, it is the way it has been alive. Every time you approach the limit, you can make it stronger. As for the cost of pain, it is nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time is not the same...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks at the tumbling squat In my mind, I still keep thinking about the feeling of the moment I woke up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it an illusion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, the ideology has risen. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not at the bottom of the birth tower, but in a half-awake recovery state, I am afraid it is difficult to detect this subtle change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And similar crickets are rare. The last creator, or the genius in the ethnic group will lead Ösluck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means...the fall of the Maharaja. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened in the north? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it your own perception of error, or is it purely coincidental? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it has to go to Nasopelle to confirm. By the way, ask yourself how long you have been sleeping, and how the West Front war is going. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence of the disaster endured the pain and climbed out of the Dianchi, slowing down as it passed by Wakiris - although the Lord of Heaven believed that it would be a nightmare The body of the Maharaja was equally safe in the city of Scorpio, but it insisted on bringing it to the god of God. There are security considerations in it, but more for another reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, as long as it is not on the battlefield, it will always be with the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, I will bring his head to see you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silence Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has deeply remembered the human male appearance in the field of the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is undoubtedly the chief culprit in the world of dreams. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only killing this person with his own hands can make Wakiris a real peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the test field, the silence found the mask Nasopelle . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Recovering very fast," the other said. "This speed of recovery is rare even in the Maharaja... I sometimes It’s very curious, if you combine the symbiosis with you, what kind of monster can you create?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...” Silence doesn’t want to take care of it. Nonsense, "How long have I been in Dianchi?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A week later, now the god of God has entered the boundaries of the morning kingdom, you are not Seeing the following insects panicking and fleeing, I just cast a few activated spears and let their city collapse.” Nasopelle gave a hazy laugh, “Flame, trampling, Screaming, panic... This is what the worms should look like!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heckzod hasn't contacted you recently?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it not to personally check the road to the sea to strengthen the transportation efficiency of the continental spine? I don't think I will take the initiative to report the situation to me." The mask shakes the towering head. "To be honest, that is what it should do. It is not suitable for it." Wang does not want the strength of the frontal battlefield. At the discount, the owner of the Scorpio was responsible for the war on the Western Front. As a result, I still have to rely on my Nasopele to clean up the mess?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than a week, plus the days before my coma, it was more than two weeks - even if the mainland spine is quite far away, but for Heckzod, such a long time is enough for it to wear Two or three times in the mountains of the spine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its combat ability is not outstanding, and in the past six months, many sentinels have observed signs of an increase in evil spirits in the sea, and the Tianhai world has attacked two from the rear. The connection point of the mainland is not impossible. Is it...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me to the birth tower," the silence is no longer hesitant," I want to see the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that it is unhealed, it needs to rely on the power of God-made God to control the connection with the king's consciousness at this distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment Nasopelle also saw something wrong, "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There is a ripple in the ideology." Silence is straightforward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...you know that I am not good at that kind of emptiness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Therefore, you need to contact the king. If it is not an illusion, Wang must know the meaning of that blasphemy more than I do." Silently replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the birth tower, Nasopelle put his palm on the tower and gathered to gather the magic power - the talents in the Maharaja are different. There are those who can sneak into the depths of the consciousness alone like Wakiris, and there are also those who are almost blind, such as the fake face, who can hardly communicate with the ideology without the aid of the birth tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Silently waiting patiently for a while, but never heard the other person’s reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?" It couldn't help but frown. "Is it still okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; If it is not a vague sense of anxiety, it will not ask so much at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Nasopelle came back and was very surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is missing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mastering the Holy See - I can't find the trace of the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silence can't help but hold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang is the backbone of the entire ethnic group, and its holy seat is equivalent to the lighthouse on the sea. Today, the disappearance of beacons means that they temporarily lose their ability to connect with the Blackrock Field. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the king will never fall, otherwise the strong shackles will be enough for all the demons to feel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only question is, what happened to the king, so that Wang closed the field of consciousness? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, before the Holy Land reappeared, it could not know the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn Kingdom, Glow City Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the god of God..." Roland stood at the top of the castle, looking at the shadow of the sky moving slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there was a psychological expectation, he really felt the heartfelt shock when he first saw it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a special effect on the movie screen, but a real thing - a floating land that is large enough to accommodate no winter city and long songs, perfect to follow Big is a good feature, and it’s just a matter of hope. If you put a steel frame and a steam pipe on the outer surface of the black rock formation, it is simply a dream creation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder the Devil’s executives will have confidence in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale leaned back in front of him and looked at him with a high degree of vigilance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
