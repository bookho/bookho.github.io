			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland was shocked when he heard the news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had no time to ask, and hurriedly followed the leaves to the back garden of the castle, only to see that the lightning was unloading the two devil bodies from the back of the wheat to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, we won!" When I saw the prince, the little girl leaped down and plunged straight into his arms. "We defeated the devil!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one is hurt?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, everyone is fine," she said. At the beginning, the eyes flashed with the "come to praise me", if there is a tail, it must have been shaken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland spit out the gas and saw that the other person showed such expression, he also did not face the responsibility of seeing the devil but did not come back to report, so I had to put this question first. Going to one side, "It’s not hurt, then... What is the specific situation?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the three people, you gave me a reply, he finally got Clear the passage of things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle seems to be easy, but in fact the risk is not small, if it is not the wheat, the next arc is safe, or the devil has the means to break free from the leaves. The consequences are hard to imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t do this kind of adventure again next time," the nightingale couldn’t help but show up. "With Sylvie, the enemy can’t escape. It’s better to fight this thing with the devil.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But we won,” said the lightning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's also a good luck. Before you fight, do you expect that McMug will be hit?" Nightingale said mercilessly, "I teach you The guns are designed to protect your sisters at a crisis, rather than taking them into danger!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes..." Her head pulled down "I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And you are too," the nightingale then looked at Mai, "I know that I should come back to report this time and still talk to her." If you make such mistakes together, you will not want to eat a piece of dried fish from me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咕..." McMug’s head also hangs Go on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No loss is the strongest witch in Bianyan Town. Roland glanced at the night glance. "Okay, this is not an example. Go help me put Tilly and Ai Gesha called, followed by a check on the spoils."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the basement of the castle, two bodies lay flat on the cold slate floor—they have been stripped of their bodies, and the broken clothes and carry-on items are neatly placed aside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the enemy in the battle of God?" Tilly snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't look much better than the average person," Ashes, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha It’s a gloomy face. “Don’t look down on them. Any devil, with or without magic, is a tough opponent. If you face a high-level devil, even if it’s superb, you’ll choose to wear the stone of punishment. She frowned at Roland. "Do they really appear near the town?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, almost, according to the leaves, only from the town wall Less than two miles away," Roland nodded and carefully examined the body in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are extremely tall, with more than two meters in their heads, thick limbs and pale cyan. One of the limbs has been severely deformed, the entire chest cavity has collapsed, and the organ has overflowed from the abdomen crack, as if it had been crushed by a cement tanker. Reminiscent of the battle of lightning narration, Roland can imagine how huge the impact at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other person is much better, at least looks perfect from the front, has two holes in his body, still braving blue blood outside - lightning bolts to the enemy Four shots were fired, and two bullets hit the target. One of them went straight through the chest and was undoubtedly a fatal blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
