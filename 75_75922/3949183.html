			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, what are you doing?" Carter felt that the Four Princes had only been arbitrarily arbitrary, and now they have risen to whimsy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you train a warrior, the chief knight feels that no one will be more professional than himself. His family has a complete training method, from ten years old to fifteen years old, in just five years to train a warrior who is proficient in all kinds of weapons. If you add another five years, it is a knight who knows the upper ceremonies - of course, if the trainees are not allowed to be civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the idiots in front of you, only eat in your eyes! And... eggs are expensive, good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland licks his ears. "You just look at it. Remember, the training for the next few days will be followed. Of course, there will be some details, I will One by one is listed on the paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the cold weapon era, trained a group of qualified soldiers in two or three months? Roland didn't have this idea at all, and he didn't need the Spartan Warrior who could tear the beast in his crotch. The individual combat effectiveness of the military may not be strong, but it must be disciplined and prohibited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the team exceeds the individual most of the time, which is determined by the social attributes of the person. If you want to do this quickly, it is probably a good choice to move the military training and then improve it according to the current environment. In his personal experience, students from all over the country can be melted into a whole in just half a month, regardless of the process, the effect is still very obvious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the group thoroughly understood the discipline, Roland was able to implement the next step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanna eventually failed to eat the second egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time the standing time is more than twice as long as the previous one, until someone has a soft leg and can't help but shake around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Four Princes just announced the rest at this time and told the attendants to issue lunch. The success of this move caused the anger of the foulers to be transferred to the food, but also let Fanna suspect that the prince of the prince may not have any intention to get them a second reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lunch is housed in four large tiled tanks, which are towed by a few carriages to the outside of the town. In addition to carrying food, the car also contains many tubs and spoons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Vanner licked his lips and prepared for a glimpse, the chief knight was in front of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince of the prince ordered everyone to be lined up in four columns, one by one to receive the tableware, and any disruption of order would be forced to distribute the last food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd crowded out four teams, his luck was very good, ranked in the forefront of the outermost column. Of course, some people expressed strong dissatisfaction with this, and there was a slap in the team. Soon the Cavaliers and several guards stormed into the crowd and drove the troublemakers out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fool, Vanner squinted at the head of the trouble, the best fight in the town. Usually relying on a brute force to cause trouble everywhere, but now it is being held on the side with a sword. Look at his poor appearance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He feels that he has already figured out the preferences of His Royal Highness Prince. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is neat and uniform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team must stand straight, the team must be a line, the meal must be lined up, the order can not be interrupted... Fanna has heard the well-informed big town merchants As said, some nobles have a strange hobby, that is, everything must be placed in a well-behaved manner, and if there is something wrong with it, it will force itself to sort out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Fanna’s consciousness, this kind of person is purely boring, has nothing to do, and even deliberately finds some trouble to toss himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, His Royal Highness is also such a person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lid of the tile was uncovered, Fanner smelled a strong scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tempting taste of the four spreads makes him almost intoxicated, and the crowd is swaying, and the snoring of the Cavaliers is also heard in front of him. Probably have to line up again, he thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
