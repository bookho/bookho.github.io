			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night walks in the "fog". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here, the world is left with only black and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines that originally formed things are no longer clear, and the lines between lines, polylines, and curves become blurred, like the graffiti of a child's pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very unspeakable feeling. It took a long time for the nightingale to become familiar with how to distinguish the boundaries. As long as it is used properly, she will be free from all things. , walking freely in the fog. Apparently connected to a wall, as long as you change the angle slightly, you can see the entrance that does not exist in the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fog, up and down, before and after are no longer fixed concepts, they will change and even overlap. For example, what she is doing now, from the bottom of the guards into the castle, along the unpredictable lines, step by step, through the ceiling, to Anna's room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her, this is a completely free world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only in the "fog", the nightingale will really relax, although it is silent and lonely, but she likes this feeling of being threatened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the time, it’s black and white, but she can see other colors occasionally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, Anna in front of me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witches are different from ordinary people, they are a mixture of magic. Nightingale can see the flow and disappearance of this power, it is also the only color in the fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has never seen such a full and intense color like Anna - the green luster is on her body, the center is close to incandescent, making it almost impossible Direct view. This makes the nightingale very confusing. Generally speaking, the color and ability of the magic are very close. She has seen many witches who have the ability to operate the flames during the support. Most of them are orange or dark red, like a beating fireball. Both size and brightness are not comparable to Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is just hard to understand, another point is incredible<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is so huge The magic is gathering on her, why is she still alive? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the whole witch support society, the nightingale can not find anyone with such magic, even if it is an adult witch, it is also dwarfed. If Anna waits for adulthood...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she doesn't have this opportunity, and the night sighs, the stronger the magic, the stronger the counterattack. She didn't even dare to imagine how terrible torture Anna would face when the demon pharyngeal fell. The severe pain that tears from the inside does not make people lose consciousness. Until they give up resistance and accept death, they have to endure uninterrupted pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked out of the fog, temporarily lowered her low thoughts and raised her spirits: "Good morning, Anna."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna is uncomfortable with the other party, the sudden appearance of the behavior has become accustomed, she nodded, did not answer, but continued to practice the control of the flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night touches the nose and walks to the girl’s bed to sit down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of practice has been seen many times. At first, Anna will also lose her hand and ignite her clothes. In the shed of the back garden, she is ready to fill it up. The bucket gave her the clothes to replace. Later, she was able to skillfully let the flames beat at the fingertips, and even Roland no longer urged her to practice. The wooden shed in the garden was changed to a place to enjoy afternoon tea and sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, Anna still performs one or two hours of practice every day, as directed by the prince, in her own room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I brought the fish cake, can I eat it?" The nightingale took out a cloth bag from her arms and spread it out to the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna sniffed and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go wash your hands," said the nightingale. Fortunately, she does not hate herself, but she is not good at talking. Speaking of it, she clearly cares about Nana Wa, and she doesn't say much. In fact, she rarely talks except in front of Roland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first she was extremely impatient, but the other party was the master of the place. The four princes of the Grey Fort, since eating his lived, then it was difficult to listen to it. Up to now, she has gradually become accustomed to these rules. I don't know why, when she competed with Anna, Nana, Roland, Carter and others for the order of hand washing, she inexplicably felt a little fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna reached into the bucket full of well water and licked it, then lit it up and dried it, pinched a fish cake and sat back to the table. , small mouth and small mouth smashed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you really not go back with me?" The nightingale had nothing to say. "There are a lot of sisters there, they will take care of you." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here, you can only be active in the castle, don't you feel bored?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are not many materials in the desolate mountains, but everyone is a family, gathered for the same purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your strength is so strong, they will be very Welcome."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This winter, I am afraid that you can't hold it..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Speaking of the back, the sound of the nightingale was low, maybe it was too late, she thought, even if she returned to the camp, she is now such a huge magic, it is almost impossible to survive adulthood. What I can do is only to see her demise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did you live before joining the Witches?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night 怔She rarely asks herself questions. "I...had lived in a big city in the east, not far from the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be happy ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy? No, it was a day when I didn’t want to go back to my thoughts. I was under the fence and was despised and mocked. When I found myself into a witch, I looked at it like a cat and a dog. The chains were tied around my neck and forced to do things for them. The nightingale shook his head and whispered, "Why ask this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to live in the old district," Anna simply told her story. "My father sold me to the church for 25 gold dragons, and my Highness took me out of the cage. Here I am very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you can't get out of this castle. Everyone except Roland Wimbledon still hates the witch."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't care, and he said He will change all this, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is very difficult, as long as the church does not fall, the witch is always the evil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna did not refute, the silence was a long time, until the nightingale thought she would never speak again, she suddenly asked: "You have a good time at the club, or have been here Have fun?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You...what are you talking about?” The nightingale was asked a little too late, “When, of course...” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a co-help? To be honest, she is not interested in finding the holy mountain, but there are friends she can't give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is Bentham Town? If she didn't hear the witch in danger, she would not come here! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer should be obvious, but why didn’t you say it right the first time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Anna smiled, and she rarely saw her laughing at night, and the eyes seemed to reflect the lake in the morning, which made people feel reassured - even I am not in the "fog". "I heard Roland say that you are looking for the holy mountain in the northern mountains. If the holy mountain means stability and home, I think I have found it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here It was her holy mountain, and the nightingale realized that although her life was running low, her soul would arrive on the other side earlier than most witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, there was a rush of running outside the door, and the nightingale listened carefully, and it was like Nana's footsteps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
