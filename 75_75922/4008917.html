			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspire to the New World...Roland is smirking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he let the nightingale recruit Anna. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the former always evades automatically, giving the two people a space to be alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna today is wearing a light blue jumpsuit, a black stocking that can be seen under the skirt, plus a pair of moccasins, very energetic. These modern styles of clothing are directed by the tailors during the leisure time of Roland. The fabric is the water-jet coating provided by Soloya. It is light and easy to wear, and is also very durable, which is very suitable for her processing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she saw her eyes full of water, Roland would involuntarily smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, now he doesn’t have to be as honest as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After pulling Anna on her lap and sniffing her scent from behind, Roland first kissed her to get to the point, "I want to To develop a new source of power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like a steam engine?" She turned her head and followed her white neck to see her prominent clavicle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland couldn’t help but reach out and touched it, causing the latter to make a low-pitched laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, say something right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough, good," he put down Anna, taking a stack of design drawings from the side of the table, "Look at this first... How much can you read?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." Entering the state of learning, Anna's look will be completely immersed. Just looking at her forgotten look, Roland will feel an inexplicable shame - as if he is sitting in a brightly lit classroom, stealing his body The schoolmaster who is eager to write a book is in the same table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to balance this mentality, he decided to let Anna bow down and ask for mercy at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Probably understand," Anna finished the last drawing and thought for a moment and nodded. "It is also driven by steam, but it pushes the piston. I replaced it with a windmill blade, thus eliminating the reciprocating motion of the connecting rod. Am I right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Exactly," Roland put away his mind. The delusion, with a serious face back, "its name is called a steam turbine, and it is still essentially driven by high-pressure steam, but the efficiency is much higher than that of a reciprocating steam engine."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Roland’s long-established revolutionary product. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that letting the basic industry get rid of the limitations of the witch is also based on this original intention - so that Anna can concentrate on higher-end mechanical production. Go up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steam turbine is his attempt in this field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of steam turbines is extremely versatile and can be used both for marine and thermal power generation, especially for the latter - it is foreseen that after the collapse of the Dragon Ridge For a long time, Count Speer had to stay in her town to handle government affairs. The magical power of the mystery month alone kept the night lighting in the factory area very stubborn, not to mention the power-up project in the residential area. Of course, Roland is not willing to admit that this is a planning failure caused by his lack of experience. To make up for this mistake, he can only use conventional means to generate electricity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steam engine due to the natural defects in the cycle principle, the current is high and low, the circuit voltage is Roland's weak knowledge, so the output power is even more A more stable and thermally efficient steam turbine is a more suitable choice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do I have to do first?" Anna asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like the last gunship," Roland turned to a page with leaves, "create a working verification model, not too big, About one meter or so, mainly to solve the problem of the angle of the blade, allowing high-pressure steam to pass through each of the vane grille smoothly. As long as this step is achieved, it will succeed most of the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Without detailed data, do you want to make a finished product like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
