			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After escaping from the dream, Roland has no sleep. He jumped up from the bed with excitement, draped his coat directly to the office, took out a few blank sheets of paper, and began to dictate some of the missing knowledge in the periodic table and elementary chemistry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two moments of entering the dream let him also find some general rules. First of all, the passage of time in the dream is not equal to the actual time. It's a good idea to understand that you can dream of a long list of content when you take a nap.—Perhaps when the perceptions of sight, hearing, and touch become internal, the brain can reach a high response speed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, he spent about eight hours in a dream until about three in the afternoon, licking that the radiant has not yet returned, using a herringbone ladder in the bedroom The fall was completed. While this is still in the middle of the night, the moon hangs high above the head, I am afraid it will take two or three hours to greet the sunrise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is the activity level of the brain. Perhaps it is because the dream is too realistic. Roland found that when he is acting in a dream, it is not the same as sleeping. This is a very difficult problem. He handles government affairs during the day and earns money to support his family at night. He is busy 24 hours a day. ? He suddenly felt that he was about to become a model worker without a winter city... or the hardest one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Roland has not tried to sleep in a dream. If you can take advantage of the time difference between the two sides, rest in the dream, it will undoubtedly greatly improve work efficiency. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is the dream itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dreams it makes in peace are very different - clear, solid, and a set of rules. Undoubtedly, this part must have been caused by Jieluo. She made dreams a new world, and Roland only knows about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it have a border? What fragments are merged? How many buried and even forgotten messages can be found inside? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to wait until dawn, after Roland used breakfast, he summoned the heads of the various departments of the City Hall to the castle meeting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the need to understand the changes and progress of the city over the past month, he also has a crucial purpose, which is to set the strategic goals for the next stage. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current threat of the church has been lifted, and the next most important thing is undoubtedly to prepare for the devil, to go all out to the upcoming battle of God. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland put his eyes on other kingdoms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh... you mean, not only from the various places of the Grey Fort, but also to the winter and the wolf to snatch the population?" Barov Wiping the forehead, "Your Majesty, this is a big project."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The news that the church has been hit hard will inevitably spread throughout the continent, the holy city of Hermes The control of Yongdong and the wolf heart can be kept at a certain level. In addition, those aristocrats who joined the church, when the situation changes, it is not surprising that they bite a bite." Roland Shen Shen, "This It is our good opportunity, whether it is tempted by Golden Dragon or forced by force, as long as we can bring these people to the Grey Fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this nationalism In an era that has not yet been awakened, there are almost no after-effects for forcing people to pull people. As long as they can pull the whole family, most people don't mind who they are working for. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the spring of the coming year, no winter city harbour can be opened. The main tasks you need to do are to develop a recruitment plan, rent a sea boat to the fjord, and Properly resettle the people who are transported." He continued to confess. "I know that the implementation of these policies will cost a lot of gold dragons, but no matter how the city hall has to bite the teeth - everyone in the room knows that the church is not a kingdom. The ultimate enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rapid expansion of the population seems complicated and huge, but in many of the details, the City Hall has already had a full "preview". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, recruitment is not a difficult task for the City Hall, which has sent messengers to the South and East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resettlement part has more complete regulations and rich experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
