			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been several horns before, and dozens of evil beasts have been attacking the border, and the militia team has been able to cope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Roland is not flustered, he announced that he interrupted training, let Wendy and lightning return to the castle to rest, Anna protects Nanava from medical treatment and waits for the injured, but And the nightingale rushed to the city wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, the lightning has raised a protest. "As an explorer, I have been in the Western China for so long. I have not seen the large-scale evil beast attacking myself. I am asking for my identity. I ask to go with you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not hesitate to reject the other party’s protest and told Wendy to be optimistic about lightning, forbidding her to be evil The beast raging time runs around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he looked at the nightingale, the latter nodded, grabbed Roland’s hand, stepped into the fog, and marched straight toward the wall – since knowing that the night After bringing the contact objects into the fog, Roland immediately became fascinated with this type of travel. Straight through the obstacles, ignoring the terrain, a few meters in a step, quite a bit of a place to enjoy the pleasure of my trip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at the foot of the city wall, Roland found a corner of no one to get out of the fog and walked on the line of defense alone. The wilderness in the distance was white, and he did not see the scene of the beast attacking. Is this a false positive? Not only did he think so, but the militia team that was in place was also arguing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince found the iron axe, only to find that he was looking at the distance with a serious face, still holding the horn in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the alarm you blew?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Highness, you see... ..." His voice is much more dry than usual. "The guy is coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy? Roland looked far and wide, and saw a black spot at the end of the line of sight, even in a pure white background, it is difficult to find. According to regulations, the collection horn will only be blown if it is determined that the patrol cannot solve it. But as an experienced hunter, the iron axe must have his reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a hybrid," he swallowed. "The one I've met six years ago."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes? Roland frowned. In theory, the evil beasts would die when they attacked the long-song fortress. They had no IQ, and there was no concept of retreat in their minds. The fortress has never been broken, but it has not died, but still lived six years later? His mind faintly raised an unpredictable hunch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But such a long distance, you can only see the black spots faintly, but the iron axe can clearly distinguish the type of evil beast, this vision is too Amazing. Perhaps, he is wrong, the prince thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil beast did not make Roland wait too long, it began to move closer to the wall, and soon everyone noticed this unique goal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not as big as the previous hybrid, at first glance, like a magnified version of the feline, but with a pair of shredded wings on its back. Covered on both sides of the torso when not deployed. The head is similar to a lion, but with two pairs of eyes - if the extra pair of eyes is not decorated, it can capture the movements in most of the rear range without turning around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carter and several hunters have installed ammunition and are waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lion-type hybrid does not rush straight up, it stops outside the range of the bow and looks around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This distance is within the effective range of the rifle, but the probability of a first hit is almost zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't take long, it suddenly leaped to the left, and the wings opened, making the huge body take off. As the iron axe said, it can fly or glides over short distances. After turning over the obstacles, the mixed species of evil beasts quickly ran towards the unguarded area at the western end of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is stunned and unrecognized. It is the proof of possession of intelligence that can be judged by observing the strength of the opponent and choosing to be weak. This is precisely what the beast lacks. They occasionally attack the prey's weaknesses, but that is the inheritance of thousands of years of instinct. When faced with unknown opponents, they have no way to judge, let alone a comprehensive analysis of multiple objectives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
