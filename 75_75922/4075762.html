			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When opening his eyes, Roland felt the weight of his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easy over the head, Anna’s calm and serene sleep is reflected in his vision – she is sideways, her head resting on his arms, The corner of the mouth tilted slightly, like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately...he can still get out of the dream world in this way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland carefully pulled out his arm and rolled over to climb up. After covering the quilt for Anna, he left the room lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the stairs, the soldiers stationed at the entrance to the corridor hurriedly stood up and saluted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved his hand and gestured to step by step to the lobby on the first floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Roland saw Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter stood in the middle of the hall, her face with a trace of loss, she lowered her head and repeatedly looked at her clenched hands, as if still relishing the limbs The moment when the touch is regained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer seems to be the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dream world is still under the control of his consciousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he wakes up, the world will stand still, and the outsiders who enter it will be forced to expel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, I..." When I saw Roland, she licked her mouth and tried to squeeze out a smile. "My dream woke up."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that for a moment, the gods who prayed that the witch would rather be trapped in the dream forever had the upper hand - because there was no choice, to continue with the continuation The devil fights, she has to turn into a non-dead, the price that can be paid is higher with time, and now it is not surprising to face the temptation of a new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the end, she still suppressed this emotion, perhaps for the compatriots of Tacula, perhaps with the obsession with the devil, or two Everyone has it, but no matter what, this powerful self-discipline makes Roland secretly admire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s not necessarily right now," he smiled. "The test was half done. You have to confirm the second half before you know that this is an accident. It’s still inevitable after the light column overlaps... let’s continue here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fillis glimpsed, “Don’t you go back to the bedroom?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Save the waking Anna," Roland shook his head. "There is heating in the castle anyway, and sleeping in the living room." He hired a guard to order. A few words, the latter widened his eyes in surprise, but still faithfully executed his orders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a quarter of an hour, the long table in the living room was covered with a layer of cushions and bedding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, a group of completely unassuming soldiers will keep the living room strictly, leaving only Roland, and Felice will stay with everyone. Stay in the hall and wait for the light column to appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that it is really difficult to fall asleep for the second time, especially when the answer to the puzzle is revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland 辗 turned to the opposite side for a long time, until the sky was slightly white, only to fall asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New World has returned to operation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised him was that the time in this dream was not forced to move to the next morning, the night is still a colorful neon night scene, the ladder still On the bedside, and Felice's eyes are recovering a little bit, and then stunned from the gloom, and looked down at Roland with disbelief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, this... Is this true? Am I not dreaming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He couldn't help but tilt his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
