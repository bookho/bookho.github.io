			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Roland looked at everyone, some people in the crowd looked at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do I find out his news?" Jia Wen whispered his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes," the latter came up with a simple report. "The family and the origins are very common. It is only accidental to become a neighbor of the lady. There is no on the list." Regarding Roland's record, it should have been a game that has not been participated. It has been three months since he joined the martial arts association. This situation is not common."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although Jiawen does not awaken the power of nature, it is no stranger to the Fighting League. As the most popular item for the audience, most of its promotion rules and regulations are familiar. In addition to the biennial top-level event "Wu Daojia Conference", other competitions can be counted as trials. The level of enrichment, even if just awakened newcomers, there is a corresponding primary competition every month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, newcomers who have just joined the association will be eager to stage their athletics in order to improve their abilities and rankings. After all, that means higher status and income. Only those awakened who are halfway back are full of resistance to this kind of show of ability in public. Of course, the credibility of this reason is equally doubtful. He even thinks that those who are pretentious have committed crimes and are not willing to do so. Expose yourself in front of the camera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the big brother of Garcia, Jiawen naturally cares about the substitutes chosen by her sister. In his impression, Garcia is definitely not a person who is easy to get close to, because the belief is too persistent, so that she and the outsider are separated by an invisible wall, and wanting to cross it will cause great damage to both sides. Stress, so there are very few people who can get her trust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jiacia and his father made this step today, and Jiawen was not surprised at all. She may be a qualified martial artist, but she is by no means a qualified businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is not the whole reason why he investigates each other, and he can only say one of them at most. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other main reason is in the VIP seats in front of the banquet hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the first row of seats - I saw a woman with a whole body white, wearing a martial robes without a little decoration on her Just like a little more temperament. The black hair grows down like a waterfall, and the back can be amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing the cold, the most dazzling star in the martial arts league, has only reached the finals of the martial arts conference twice since its debut. Although it has not yet won the championship, most people think that it is just that she is too young and inexperienced. As long as it takes time, the strongest name must be in her bag. Such an excellent talent made her a representative of the new generation of geniuses, and even rumors that when she won the championship, she entered the high-rise of Prism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jia text thought that people like this would not pay attention to the invitation of Sanye Group. I didn’t expect her to actually go to dinner, which really surprised my father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Filipino's attendance, this dinner will inevitably become the most eye-catching headline in recent news. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when he was hard to find a chance to talk, he was entrusted with an unexpected task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jiawen pressed the distracting thoughts and walked slowly to the other side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Fijian, you asked me what to ask..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not repeat I heard it." She interrupted, then smiled a little, "Thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen, hear? Jiawen looked back in surprise and looked at his position. It was almost ten meters away. Or in the noisy banquet hall, can the martial artist really have such a keen sense of ability? Simply... not like humans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not all news can be heard - even if the ear can do it, the brain can't handle it." Probably seeing his surprise, Fiji Qu Han explained a few words in a rare way. "When your hand is close to you, I intentionally strengthen my attention. After concentration, I can restore the whole content of the dialogue through the mouth, voice, and expression. For most For martial arts, this is not difficult to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The strongest?" Her voice was as sweet as a wind chime. "I haven't got the trophy yet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sooner or later, sooner or later Well, besides you, who else can be on the rut of the martial arts conference in the first year of awakening. Even if it is the "holding" of Prism City..." Speaking, Jiawen’s voice is getting smaller. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing the cold, although it looks like listening, but the smile on her face is like a smile, but he gave birth to a completely neglected Feeling - just as to be smiling but polite, in fact she has no interest in her own words, I don't want to talk anymore.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly realized that The other party’s thank you, in fact, already implies the end of the dialogue. The explanation behind it is just to look at the face of the organizer Sanye Group, but this face is only enough to say two more words. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought of this, he couldn’t help but give birth to a fire, wherever he went When he was sought after, he experienced such treatment!<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the anger just rose, and Jiawen forced it down.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The martial arts association is not an organization that Shuangye Group can offend - it has inextricably linked with national governments and industries.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, the father does not have to pay a big price to pay these people.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He squeezes a smile and turns away from the guest table.< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this subtle expression change has not escaped the eyes of Fiji.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just She does not care about the thoughts of these ordinary people. In the face of erosion, wealth and power have limited meaning. The only thing that can be relied on is their own strength.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will look back Into the direction of Roland.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial agreement to attend the banquet is just to listen to the teacher, she is not sure why waste The cultivation time, to participate in such communication activities - until the emergence of the man, only slightly caught her attention.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improve the heart of nature to a certain After the degree, the awakened person can roughly perceive the level of the opponent, which is not caused by a special ability, but a comprehensive manifestation of the observation power to a new height. Fei Yuhan reached this level three years ago and found that as long as he is not in Prism City, there are only a handful of people who can surpass her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her insights have lost their power in front of that person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action, tone, eyes, slight skin shake, these are no different from ordinary people, only the fluctuation of the natural heart, she can not feel it at all . Without this, it loses the benchmark for judgment. If the other party is just an ordinary person, then there is nothing strange about it. From the hospitality of the waiter, he is a martial artist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Fiji Han came to Jiawen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she can check the information such as rankings, she prefers to hand over the trivia to others - as long as they are simple, they will Do not spare the effort to complete your own commission, and often can do better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she heard the name "Roland" from Jiawenkou. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All confusion has been solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as a week ago, Fiji Han knew something from the master... Prism City gave birth to a "hunter", that is A martial artist holding a hunting license. This is nothing strange. In order to fight against the evil demon, we must give the warriors some power to go beyond the limits so that they can destroy the enemy more efficiently. In general, there are not many people who can become hunters. Some of the people she knows are predecessors who can be named. But this hunting license is sent to a new member who is not a member. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the identity information of the hunter is not listed as top-secret information by the association, I am afraid that this incident will immediately cause a big shock. It is important to know that the association usually refers to the hunting license holder and the martial arts champion as the same level of warrior, and even the former tends to be even higher. This award also means that someone just awakened and won the league championship. The trophy, what an incredible thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
