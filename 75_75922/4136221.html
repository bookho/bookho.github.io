			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ship is coming, guys! All move!" Simbadi shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"噢噢噢!" The fishbone clan rushed to the dock and busy with their own lives - some were responsible for fixing the cable, some were responsible for erecting The springboard, although it seems to be a mess, has no delay, as long as it does not board the ship, its posture is not much worse than the old sailor. It's hard to imagine that these people didn't even see the sea a few times a year ago, let alone do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, the goods on board were carried away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sinbad, they said they can get on the goods!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red goods are still black Goods, how many barrels on each, have you asked clearly?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassured, I remember it on the back of my hand!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, let's get started!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goods" are commonly used shorthands, and the whole endless cape only produces one kind of The goods, that is the water of the river. However, with the expansion of the mining area, the sand people found that it is not only a color. In the other two underground valleys, there are dark red and dark green waters of the Styx – they can also burn, which is a big difference in nature and smell. Therefore, for the sake of convenience, everyone began to use "goods" instead of black water, and this name was quickly spread among the northerners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbad is the fourth time to work in Daqing Port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembers when he first set foot on this ridiculous sand, the first thought was that if he could survive, he must leave this place after three months. The farther the better. But beyond his imagination, a city is really rooting at the southernmost tip of the desert. If the oasis is revived into a miracle, Daqing Port can be described as miraculous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless cape has become a place of exile, precisely because it has nothing but danger, even if it is a sophisticated hunter, it is impossible to survive alone. And to build a town where hundreds or even thousands of people live here, only three gods can do it for the sand people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that the chieftain who underestimated the power of the desert would completely dispel this absurd idea after the failure of the attempt, but did not expect to know nothing about the desert. On the contrary, it is the sand people who have lived here for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Endless Cape is not without anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that they never realized it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first problem to be overcome is the water source. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northland official named Concord led them to build a reservoir that could not be seen at the end - it was covered with black film The low shed did not see any flaws at first, but when the evil moon ended, the sand people discovered that the sun could really separate the salt of white flowers from the sea. The water vapor forms a dew on the film, and then merges into the tube groove along the inclined surface, and finally merges into the storage tank. The more violent the sun, the faster the water storage speed. Although there is not much fresh water produced by a pool, hundreds of pools can be added up, and the water volume is very impressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reservoirs of today are still expanding, they can not only meet the needs of the sand people, but also provide replenishment for ships without winter city. Subverted the inherent concept of Mo Jinsha people in the past 100 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is housing issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tent alone is not able to withstand the direct sunlight of the noon sun. The closer it is to the summer, the more it is. If there is no reliable summer, there is no water. how long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the stone in Tiesha City comes from the sandification in the extreme south, which is why there are many oases in Yinchuan, but only one city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of the North is still based on local conditions. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They built a kiln, using black water as fuel, filling the mud from the seabed, mixing it with the fine sand that was screened, and firing it. Into a piece of brick. Due to the inexhaustible raw materials, Daqing Port soon had a number of brick-built bungalows, and the exterior walls and ceilings were double-layered. Even if it is not comparable to the oasis covered by the shade, it is stable. The place to live. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders of the Aosha clan, Thuram, commanded everyone to pull up dozens of fishing nets on the beach. When the tide rises, the sea water will swallow all these nets, and when the tide ebbs, the nets are surrounded by squares. "There will be a lot of strange prey, such as sea crabs, sea snakes, sea urchins or something." At first, Simbadi did not dare to eat these malformed foods, but under the threat of the Turam whips, he could only bite his teeth and choose to comply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that the taste of these things is unexpectedly good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the staple food is still to be shipped from the winter city, their food is much richer than a year and a half ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the food and shelter were resolved, Simbadi’s mentality gradually changed. After the three-month dispatch period, he chose himself. I was surprised that I continued to work in Daqing Port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the rewards here are much richer than the clear water port. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is another reason for him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After filling the last sea boat, today’s busy counts One paragraph. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sinbad, you have worked hard today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Big Brother, see you tomorrow morning!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will want to go to the market to see if you want to be with me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Since many times he participated in the dispatch, Simbadi became the head of the nominal fishbone clan, but when he had any tasks, Thuram was the first to find him. In the face of such changes, he was somewhat flattered. When he was still in the Yinchuan Oasis, he was a very insignificant member of the family. Not to mention what he was responsible for, and he was not willing to talk to him. But now, not only do the younger generations regard him as the leader, but even some girls have extended the invitation to him. This made him more grateful to the Grand Chief and a little more proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Simbadi did not accept those invitations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he already has a person in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, wait for me, Sinbad!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just when he is ready to leave the dock When looking for Molly, a familiar voice was introduced into his ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinbaddi couldn’t help but raise his mouth. He smiled and looked back, his expression suddenly stiffened on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who came is indeed Molly, who always has a big black scorpion, and the only girl in the family who has not shown his disapproval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the arrogant son of Caroline left the dispatch team, Molly did not choose to quit, which is also a major reason for his persistence. Simbadi thought he might have a chance, but now he saw the other man pulling a man's hand and ran over to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that man is not a Mojinshamin! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Murrie, you...and him..." Zimbabwe stuttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah!" Molly noticed that the two men’s hands were holding each other, and they quickly released their palms, embarrassedly laughing, "I I was anxious to bring him to see you, only to catch him all the way."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes... is this?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Call, this lady is really good physically," the man gasped. "I don't want to stop, it's like being pulled by a bull....Mo Jinsha The people are well-deserved." He looked at Sinbaddi's eyes. "I introduce myself first... My name is Rex, from the fjord on the other side of the sea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "You will know that you are a fjord at a glance," Simbadi warned Molly behind him. "I have nothing to recycle, let's go!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Daqing Port has been developing steadily for a long time, and to expand the site and population a little bit, then in the past three months, it can be said that the calm has been completely broken. The endless cape seems to have become a popular route overnight, and a large number of fjord boats have appeared in this new port city and have brought a series of troubles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
