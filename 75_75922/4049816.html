			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" Margaret curiously said, "What about freshly brewed fruit wine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "If it's just a fruit wine, it's not as good as a perfume," Neblon shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not necessarily," Gamol looked at the glass bottle with great interest. "Don't talk about what's in the bottle. Light is unique." The container is worth a few golden dragons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it a new product of the Wangdu Alchemy Association?" Marlan also echoed, "I have never seen it before." Such a large crystal glass bottle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The appearance is not important, the key lies in the goods themselves," Roland was a little bit stunned, he did not expect these businessmen to First interested in glass bottles. As long as the colorless glass has mastered the formula, it is completely a low-cost product, but he did not dump the glass container separately. The reason is that the current glass output of No Winter City is all used in chemical laboratories, perfume factories and beverage factories. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's called a chaotic drink, just like its name, chaos is unpredictable, every bite is a unique enjoyment." He cleared his throat, so Mysteriously, "I bet you have never tasted a similar taste. If you don't believe it, you will know it after you try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three bottles of drink are all Roland Carefully selected from Evelyn's beverage library, not only the tastes are unique, but also two of them have been specially processed - one bottle was chilled, chilly, chilly and pleasant; one bottle added dry ice, It can be described as a kind of carbonated drink in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result was just as he expected, and he gave a slight sigh of relief, and the five businessmen’s faces showed a wonderful look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How is this allotted?" Etienne snorted. "These wines have nothing to compare with one, and there is no taste at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look at this green apple juice, still sighing... God, is it breathing?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Apple? It’s not so sweet even if you put honey!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Business people have expressed their opinions and toasted There was no pause at all, and the drink had a cup and a cup until the three bottles were empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗝..." Plus Moore still licked his lips, "Your Majesty, your... chaotic drink... it’s great!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you sell as a product, do you think there will be a market?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course!" Moon Bay merchants don’t think about it, “Considering the differences in personal tastes, maybe the popularity of the three drinks will be slightly different, but they are definitely rare wines! I bet, after I tasted it, the top wine from the morning sun. I am afraid that no one will care."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are frank," Roland couldn’t help but raise his mouth. Most businessmen would pick some if they wanted to buy goods. It’s not too much to see such a straightforward praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't dare to deceive and don't want to deceive my tongue." Gamore paused for a moment, "I just don't understand one thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why would you give it such a weird name?" He picked up the empty bottle that had been chilled, and there was still a thin layer of hoarfrost on it. "For example, this can be called a deep sea ice spring. If it is placed in the summer, I can guarantee that it will appear on every banquet. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the bottle of green drink, I think it can be called nectar - really, there seems to be countless small fish The feeling of smashing out of the egg and constantly hitting the tongue is really memorable." Marlan added. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too," Margaret laughed. "The word chaos sounds novel, but it does not highlight their distinct characteristics. If separated To name it, I will sell it better.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
