			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer Hermon sat at his desk and subconsciously fiddled with a beautiful piece of parchment in his hand - that is the long opera house sent every weekend afternoon If the program is in peacetime, he will definitely pick up the favorite drama, let the butler pay the deposit, and then send the invitation to Shirley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he doesn't read a word now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is the seventh day of the expedition. If it is successful, my father should return with the Duke of the Lord yesterday. Perhaps it is a delay on the road, maybe it is a tired man, tired of rest in the border town for a day? He comforted himself, but the uneasiness in his heart was slowly expanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four prince Roland. Wimbledon left him a deep impression, and Pedro even felt incredible, why such an outstanding prince is in the king There are all kinds of bad reviews. Poor personality, embarrassment, incompetence, no learning, no skills... Any evaluation is different from the prince he knows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the case, his uneasiness will be so strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is afraid that the Duke will lose to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Peero," the housekeeper shouted outside the door, "There is a letter from the fortress."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fortress is coming? Pei Luo groaned, "Get in."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncover the cover, the first sentence on the letter paper makes Pei stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the letter written by the Four Princes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Duke of Osmond Ryan attacked the territory of the king by force, attempting to rebel, attempted. The Duke himself has been on the battlefield, now the long song fortress has been attributed to this The hand of the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke lost? His heart was so heavy that he looked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Duke of Ryan’s accomplices, with the exception of a few diehards, have surrendered and pleaded guilty. The rebel priests were executed, but the king was kind and only slandered and sinned. For those who are unspeakable, the rest of the participants can use the money to redeem the captives in accordance with the customary customs. The place of exchange is in the castle of the Lord of the Long Song Fortress. The following is a list."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This essay makes it very awkward to make sentences. It is not a common language of diplomacy, but the meaning of the expression is understood. The Duke’s rebellion failed, he wanted to take prisoners and exchange money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyro’s line of sight moved down slightly, and his father’s name appeared in the first row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Herdes!" He shouted the name of the butler, "Ready, I am going to Fortress Castle!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Honeysuckle is in the east of the fortress, and when Pedro rushed to the castle area, it was half an hour later. The lord's castle stood in front of the "militia" he had never seen before - they had no shiny armor, no cloaks and ribbons, and a strangely shaped short stick in his hand, with a sharp thorn gun at the top. Just standing neatly and standing upright in two rows made him feel compelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the notification, Pei was taken to the garden and then taken by a guard to the castle hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This place has been here many times, but today, he is like stepping into a completely strange field. The guards who stand on the aisle are never seen before. Face, no one smiled at him, but looked at him with a blank expression. At the entrance of the hall, a knight greeted him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Peer Hermon," Unsatisfactorily replied, he did not like this interrogative dialogue, so he emphasized it again, "Sirmond."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," the other party looks I didn’t think so, I looked at the list in my hand. “The Count of Chara is not yours...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Father.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Disrespect," said the Cavaliers on his mouth, but his expression was not apologetic. "I am Carter Lannis, the chief knight of the Four Princes. Please come to the side room first, we need Check if you have a weapon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
