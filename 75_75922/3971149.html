			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, there were countless tiny stone chips and dust on the street, and the ground made a loud noise, and the enemy’s body shape slammed and the back spewed out. The bloody fog of the group - the dense bullets constitute an invisible wall, and the life will block the rushing guards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dry beautiful!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"killed this group of monsters!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nail also clenched his fist with excitement, the enemy's armor burst a little spark under the heavy machine gun, hitting the head and chest and abdomen almost immediately killed, even hit the hands and feet It is also a broken limb, not like a revolver. More importantly, there is almost no gap in the bullet shooting, even if it is missed two or three shots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the gunshots stopped, white smoke had already appeared on the barrel. The maddening army left a body of corpse, and Cangjie retreated backwards. Those enemies who were not killed and completely incapable of movement were lying on the ground and mourning. In their eyes, the nails saw deep fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Raise the gun!" the captain shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembering the teammate who was split in front of him, the nail did not hesitate to pick up the rifle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After cleaning the road, the team can finally move forward again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the five commandos arrived at the entrance of the palace, they immediately built a temporary shooting position according to the training requirements, while monitoring the movements of other streets - in order to prevent being trapped before and after The team that attacked the inner city was divided into three teams, which were propelled from three main streets and flanked each other, so that no matter which direction the enemy circumvents, they would be blocked by the first army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nails found that the plan was not as smooth as the training, and the streets in the south were fired, almost impossible to pass, and they were on their own side. In the face of the gravel obstacles that the field guns are difficult to overcome, they are scattered by playing the team. When faced with a strong counterattack, the players did not care about the north and south, and also forgot to observe the signal of Miss Lightning. A commando that originally belonged to their own team did not even know where to go. The guns could be heard everywhere in the inner city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, they were the first to arrive at the meeting place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the various teams also arrived at the entrance to the palace, and the field guns slowly pushed up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot air balloon floated again above the palace, and as the four bombs razed the courtyard walls and iron gates, the final battle began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*******************<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Your Majesty, they have already reached the palace gate, run away!" Osbourne guard Osborne anxiously said, "If you don't leave, you will be too late!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fei Ke sat in the bed of the palace and silently said nothing. At that time, my father ended his life here, and now it seems that it is his turn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the death of Wimbledon III, he took the opportunity to push the matter to the great prince Gron, solved this biggest hidden danger, and reached the peak of power. In the following year, he integrated the east and the north, and at the same time forced the three sisters Jiaxia, the momentum is no longer. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that I would win the West in a sooner or later, and it was only a matter of time to unify the entire Grey Fort, but I did not expect that the change of the situation would be so sudden and unpredictable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the madness army repeatedly attacked Bianbu Town without any effect, and then the sudden explosion made his mind cast a shadow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then just three days... all the advantages are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he received the news from Chishuicheng, he never thought that he had only three days to prepare - the snow in the North has not melted yet. Spring ploughing just entered the stage of rumbling, it is too early to go to the local to force the militia, and the letter of assistance sent to the east is estimated to have just been sent to the new Duke of the East. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he only used the Knights of the Kings, the mercenaries, the patrols, and the guards and servants of the surrounding nobles to fight from the rush, and the king was proud of it. The wall of the city has not been able to survive for a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, devil!" His voice was awkward, with a trembling in his anger. "The church is a waste, claiming to hunt." Killing the witch, but it has missed Roland Wimbledon! If it is not a witch, why is his firearms so much stronger than mine, why can he easily attack from the air? Whether it is craftsman, alchemist or wealth, I am It’s hundreds of times! There is only one explanation, the devil of hell is helping him!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two explosions rang under the palace, the window glass was shocked The sound of the intermittent killing came faintly, and that was the last attempt of the Guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I can't die! Tiffco hated to think that if he committed suicide, wouldn't he be cheaper? The hell should be your own brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are advanced." He stood up and softened, almost fell down again, but the guards helped him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Your Majesty," Osborne breathed a sigh of relief. He picked up Tefko and called the guards at the door and walked toward the fireplace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This secret road has both a live gate and a dead gate. Once the dead door is put down, the entrance will be completely blocked and will never enter. The bottom of the earth is embedded with the stone of God's punishment, and it is also hidden in the organs. In addition, the martyrdom is complicated, and Tiefko has not fully ascertained it - probably from the construction of this palace, the underground part of the secret passage has been completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six went to a larger lounge, and the new king stopped the team, allowing everyone to rest a little while waiting for the opportunity to flee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still daytime, although there are several outlets of the secret passage, the longest one can even go straight outside the city, but now the rash action is still very big. risk. After all, the other party has a witch who can carry the gunpowder, which makes him remember. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safe way is to wait until the night is quiet, and then be covered by the gods, even the witch can not sneak into. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you have to wait until late at night, you can lie down and take a nap for a while," the former guards pulled a stack of blankets from the side of the cabinet and laid them on the floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tefco was lying on the blanket, the slightly damp, musty smell made him frown, nervous and stunned, and the two emotions alternately impacted his mind. How can it be difficult to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are you going next? Northland or East? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are supportive aristocrats on both sides, and the Duke is also the vassal of his new appointment...but they know that after the fall of the king, they will not follow themselves as always. Still a problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either...church? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea grows up in his mind as soon as it comes out, the big aristocracy itself is the wall grass, even if his brother and the witch are together They will still choose to compromise when faced with threats, just like the guys who have long songs. But the church... At least there will be no witches on the open side, let alone the nobility who raised a large number of witches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this group of gods is arrogant and slow, you can never sit down and watch the devil's power spread in the gray castle kingdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the church can fulfill its desire for revenge, what if the father’s kingdom is given to them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as... as long as you can personally send Roland Wimbledon to the guillotine, then torture the damn witches one by one, or you will not swallow This tone! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the dim light of the torch, Tiefco made the decision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Estimated to wait until midnight, the pedestrian directly escaped the king from the longest channel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have not yet walked out of the middle of the road, and suddenly there are more than a hundred lights in the surrounding fields! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your Majesty, Run--" Osborne’s words only came to an abrupt end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
