			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is a little surprised, although these theories are common sense in later generations, but as astrologers lacking the means of observation, they can see that the stars are orbiting. This is not easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Star of the World should also be like this," the other party continued. "It is rumored that it appeared for four to five hundred years, that is, its The trajectory is very broad and it takes so long to get close to us. The sun and the moon are by our side, and it takes only one day and one night to run the whole journey." He gasped. "As we all know, the farther away from us, It seems to be smaller, and it should be the same in the sky. So when the Star of the World is close to us, there will inevitably be a process from dark stars to bright stars, and finally to the moon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you finding it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diffuse star shook his head, "from the mission that was passed down hundreds of years ago There is no clear temporary space, so the Star of the World is likely to be still in a corner of the sky, and it is too far away to be observed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "In the past few decades... have you been doing this kind of thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p; "Yes, Your Majesty," the voice of the old man revealed exhaustion. "I became an astrologer apprentice for 40 years ago. I have not stopped looking up for 40 years, even before I became chief, I I don't know why I have to stare at a starry sky that will not change for decades. In addition to recognizing the stars and recording the season, the astrologers will also be divined on festivals or festive days, but that is to follow the king's meaning. Instead of truly predicting the future – all of this must be kept secret, and only the name of the sage who maintains astrology can attract follow-up apprentices.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You regret it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diffused star shook his head. "If it was ten years ago, I might regret it, but since I became the chief, I took it from the Star of the Stars. From this heavy responsibility, I understood what I was looking for – it would be a real astrology, an unparalleled prophecy, and the meaning of astrological associations. Unfortunately, I can’t wait longer. ."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not much, his hair is all white, the wrinkles on his face are like mountains, the brown spots are covering the forehead, Roland thinks, I am afraid that after two or three years, he Life will come to an end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is a disaster, will the ancestors not pass any defense or evasion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the question you should consider, Your Majesty," the bachelor squeezed a smile. "Astrology is just your eyes. It is the responsibility of the king to know how to lead the people to survive in the disaster. So you can't Turn it off... Even if the earth is cracked, it can be predicted in advance, and people will have more chances to survive if they can predict in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland can’t help but Respect, day after day, only to verify this prophecy, even in the face of the red moon symbolizing the end of the day, still abide by his duties, this attachment is not available to everyone. If the royal successors know in advance that the end will come, what will it look like? Indulge yourself, let go of all constraints, and seize the time to enjoy the rest of your life? This is probably the reason why the ancestors will tell the time after the age of thirty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long silence, he asked the last question, "There are also astrologers in other kingdoms, their purpose? It is also to find this star of destruction." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know... I have never left the king, and they have not sent anyone to the Grey Fort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, come here today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...do not turn off the astrology?"< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the time being, keep it," Roland stood up and walked outside the hall. When he was about to leave the room, he turned his head and looked at the chief astrologer who was sent to him. "When I have time, I will send you some better stargazing tools and real astrology knowledge."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The other side showed a confused look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland did not explain, and then said, "In addition, even if the red moon is coming, it is not the end," he paused for a moment, his tone was snarled, "- - We will survive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
