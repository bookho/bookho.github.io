			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night fades, and the curtains reveal a radiance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s dawn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Gesha almost sleepless night, all the words in the head are nightingale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The people throughout the mainland are the most powerful groups."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four hundred years Time can change a lot of things. Why do you still hold the previous concept and refuse to give it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The time is still very long, you can confirm with your eyes." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned over and went to the hanger, stroking the robes that symbolize the Tactical Quest. I remember that when I got this robes through three unanimous approvals, my mood was just as happy as flying. Exploring the mystery of magic is what she pursues throughout her life, and one of the most fascinating words of the Quest is "existence is truth", if the mortal can really prove his power...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Ai Gesha put on her robes and pushed the door to the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I may be the last member of the Quest, and the only survivor of Takira, who wants to rebuild the new holy city, not a day or two. Things that can be done. Before that, you may wish to see for yourself what the mortal prince can do, and let the witches listen to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having breakfast, Ai Gesha, accompanied by Wendy, came to the gray-haired prince's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dressing is not much different from that of 400 years ago, but it feels different from the common mercenaries, merchants and farmers in the suburbs, with the family. Guardian Kraft is also different - most of them can judge the depth of the eye at a glance, and even the thoughts of the bottom of the heart can be guessed. It is as simple as a hollow symbol. However, this method of identification cannot be used on the prince, especially the eyes of the other party. It is just an ordinary gray pupil, but it is full of indescribable looks and confidence, especially the latter, which is different from the confidence brought by blind optimism. It is derived from a calm and peaceful peace that does not match the age, as if he has lived... for thousands of years, he knows everything about the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you feel this way? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name is Roland Wimbledon, and Ai Gesha silently remembered the name in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How was the rest of the night?" The other smiled. "After four hundred years, the porridge and fried eggs should be your appetite?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s better if you don’t send a witch to enter my room.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He gave a slight glimpse, then shook his head helplessly. "Well, she will knock on the door later. Right, if you want to go outside and visit the towns and people's customs of this era, you can find a nightingale." If you want to view historical books, you can ask the lady of the book, but she keeps all the books she has read in her head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People's customs?" Gesha frowned. "The threat of the devil is close at hand. I just want to see how you dare to boast that mortals can also defeat the devil. If you can't stop their offense, history and customs are meaningless!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince grinned: "It is also important to light industry and people's livelihood compared to heavy industry... The gun is interested."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the weight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, nothing... ..." The other side spit out the gas. "You will see that this afternoon is about to test the performance of the new weapon. But before that, I still have some questions to ask you about - the holy city four hundred and fifty years ago. Takira."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new weapon operated by a mortal? Ai Gesha can't help but think of the bow and the trebuchet. If it is only an improvement of these things, it is not enough to deal with the devil. But she did not reveal the doubts in her heart, "Ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mentioned before, the holy city of Tacula is a city ruled by witches, no magic Ordinary people can only be counted as the lower class, so how many times do they eat a day? What is the staple food and how much meat is eaten?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
