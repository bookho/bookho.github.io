			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The location of the test was selected in a flat valley in the desolate mountains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding area is surrounded by mountains, there is little smoke, if you do not rely on tunnel or airborne, it is difficult to enter here from the outside. It can be said that this is a mountain Jedi, which is very suitable for doing things that need to be hidden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not because of the mystery of the napalm weapon, but how many uncommon figures are among the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah...the air here is really good, I can smell the floral and earthy smells inside," said Celine from the cracks in the rock formation, shaking With the tentacles of the whole body, "The last time I saw the blue sky, it was almost 200 years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightingen hit a Hey, he looked at Roland, his face showing a sense of panic that was overwhelmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About anyone who sees a huge sarcoma monster emerging from the ground, will be involuntarily afraid, if placed in a disaster movie, this classic debut form is absolutely It can be regarded as a small climax that requires a special soundtrack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention the inexplicable voice in his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that if you can not be intimidated on the spot, you are already a qualified Executive Officer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Roland chose to test weapons in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, they were humans, but they have become like this because of the devil." He patted the shoulder of the alchemist. "The voice you hear is that they are talking with consciousness. If you want to talk to them, just say it or repeat it in your heart. Just like this-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He turned to Celine. "With the ability of the original carrier, it is not difficult to see a blue sky and green water?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She always kept herself in the research room.” Pasha climbed out of the ground. “The goddess of witches often talked to me about what I saw and heard in the world of dreams. You have a word that is dedicated to Describe this phenomenon, it seems to be... House is coming?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do I remember the two adjectives in front of this word?" The last one appeared It is Elsie with a high-level devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you want me to say it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland raised his eyebrows at Lightning. "How are they not so terrible, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, you are talking about..." The latter smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "By the way, although they have lost their human appearance, they have achieved near-eternal life. At the same time, the new skin has extremely high heat and corrosion resistance. Sexuality, which means that most chemicals can be touched directly; the tentacles are sensitive and sensitive, even if you operate multiple tests, there is no problem. That is to say, this body is the most suitable form for chemical research, how, you Interested in learning more?" Roland shrugged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey," Lightning's throat moved, and after a while he sang back. "I...still, sire."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he said this, he looked at the early evasiveness of the high-level witches of Taqila, and there was a hint of curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland smiled and shook his head and walked over to the tightly bound devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the other party has no feet, there are a lot of imprisonment means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, this body is still a god of punishment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He crouched down and looked at the other side. "I remember you called Kabu...Radaby, is that right?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland said in disapproval. "This is a fireworks show specially prepared for you. You have committed a lot of crimes in the light and destroyed most of the personal kingdoms into red fields. Now it is our turn to get back to this journey. Then, let's enjoy it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then nodded to Leitington, "Prepare for the experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alchemist looked at the devil and said with aloud, in the principle of "Don’t ask more questions without giving the initiative," "Yes... Your Majesty!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After everything was ready, everyone entered the bunker tunnel, leaving only the devil alone on the mountain wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ignition countdown, ten, nine... one, detonation!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is responsible for the operation The escort turned the hand-cranked squib. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the center of the valley ignited a fiery flame - unlike the large-scale explosive demonstration of the previous artillery drill, this time the fire was not bright It even looks a little dim. The flames are surrounded by a lot of black smoke, which is heavy and thick. No matter the sound or the degree of shock, it is far less than the earth-shattering of explosives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everyone quickly felt the special features of the new weapon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the observation hole, everyone clearly sees that the black smoke thrown up does not dissipate quickly, but rises slowly, as if it is not transparent. The curtain of light. It is not so much a soot, it is better to say that it is a magma with fire - the hot air flow pushes the fuel to the sky, and then spreads like an open umbrella. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the umbrella is fully open, the flashing red light not only does not disappear, but is more vigorous, and quickly turns the falling fuel into a rogue flame! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland knows that it is the effect of aluminum powder and iron oxide in the combustion zone being ignited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat released by the reaction seems to have brought about a second continuous explosion – a process that lasts for a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire and the rain are scattered, and the place where it is exposed will immediately ignite a new fire. Even if there is enough safety distance, he can still feel the blow. The hot air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the action of gravity, the black smoke and the flame are finally completely separated, the former dissipates in the sky, while the latter completely dominates the earth. There was a forest and a stream in the center of the valley, but now there is only a ring of fire in the middle of the valley. As for the pre-placed test animals, Roland felt that there was no need to check it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the other side of the tunnel, Els couldn’t help but roll up the Lord’s must. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Tacula era has such a weapon, how good! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the red fog is afraid of fire, the devil’s outpost is always bare, and it’s just like a few witches who want to disperse the red fog, even if the witch Trying to create a high-temperature fire source, it is difficult to make a difference without the maintenance of magic. But the weapon allowed her to see the hope of quickly eradicating the outpost – as long as it could be transported in, it would open a path for the subsequent army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her comrades do not have to delay the time to help the mortal army, helplessly die under the attack of the devil and the red fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to have seen the smog tower covered by the fire burning, until it becomes a dazzling pillar of fire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual communication that belongs only to the original carrier is rapidly passing through the minds of three high-level witches who can understand each other’s thoughts and emotions even without language. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the exchange, Elsie quietly turned his gaze to the mortal man, secretly sighing... He was not born four hundred years ago, actually It is a pity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flame lasted for almost four hours before it subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one piece of scorched earth left in the valley, and there is nothing to burn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland walked out of the tunnel, feeling suddenly coming from the early spring to the midsummer, the hot air piled up here, turning the valley into a temporary greenhouse area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
