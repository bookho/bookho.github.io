			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa stunned and then said in a surprised tone, "It seems that Felice is right, you know it to us." Less. Regarding the issue of God, we only know something after the destruction of Tacila. This news should not be told by Ai Gesha."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgot, the church was defeated in my hands.” Roland covered his chin with his hands crossed, pretending to be deep. “Those witches who had held management duties in the holy city of Hermes are now being held in the winter city. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original is..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasa is silent for a long time, as if looking quietly In general, even if she could not see her eyes, Roland could feel this kind of physical examination. After a long time, her consciousness reappeared in her mind. "You want to know what God is, and you can't do it, but please keep this secret in your heart. Don't rumor. The same is true for everyone here. When you want to chase Or when you guard against something that you can’t see or touch, you won’t fall into despair. But when it becomes tangible, the psychological pressure will increase greatly. If it leaks out, it’s probably not good for the third battle of God. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Roland confirmed each other with the witches, Shen Sheng asked, "So God is a tangible thing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, it is like a piece of sacred stone, sharply spindle-shaped, but it does not hinder the magic, and has no special effect." Pasha slows down The speed of speech, as if recalled and said, "But as long as you open your eyes and protect you, you can really feel the call of the gods and see some incredible sights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"What kind of sight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs p;&nbsp;"An infinitely wide hall, a red moon with a high overhead, and four huge incomparable vertical paintings. Only the scenes in the painting are fresh and ready to change..." The ancient witch will The illusion created by God is described in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What exactly do those scenes represent?" Tilly couldn't help but ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her question, everyone held their breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This problem has been plaguing people for nearly a thousand years, and the Quest will try hard to find answers, and it will not be until the documents in the maze remains are interpreted, we have confirmed this. "All the tentacles on Pasha have been raised. "The gods show us human beings, demons, unknown enemies, and underground civilizations. The shape of the gods also confirms this. It is not a complete vertebra." Body, but a quarter of the cut, so we call it the relic of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Four giant paintings, one quarter Relics..." Roland frowned. "Do you mean that every civilization shown in the giant painting has such a relic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Not every one, the underground civilization has lost its god." Pasha's answer made the participants feel creepy. "One of the giant paintings has fallen into the eternal black silence, and time is exactly the first time. Shortly after the end of the war. According to the self-report in the literature, and the federation The following records are in contrast, and we made the speculation that it has been delisted forever from the battle of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say, stretch After hundreds of years of war, it is to compete for the relics in the other's hands, and losing your own relics is equal to losing all the money? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland’s brows are deeper, which is really not good news. Compared with those unknown opponents, he cares more about who has arranged all of this. Is it accidental or inevitable? Is it a random choice or a fate? What is the purpose of leaving the relics? Is it related to the red moon that periodically comes? And most importantly, will the survivors' understanding be correct? A series of problems emerged in the brain, and at the same time he felt that he was faintly caught...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandon the word of God and replace it with other titles? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he meditated, Tily asked, "What happens if we collect all four relics on our hands? The gods never have Have you indicated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No one knows the answer, and the god has never responded to our call." Pasha said calmly, "God does not love the world, It only favors the winner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
