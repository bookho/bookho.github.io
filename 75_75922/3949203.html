At this time, he calmed down. "The purpose of your deception is to get rid of me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remove you? No, that It doesn't help me, dear brother. I am helpless in doing this," Tefko's tone is still calm, as if to state a fact, "If I honestly wait until five years later, I am afraid It’s the third pirate army. Do you know what she is doing lately?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gron shook his head and estimated his distance from the second prince . He remembers that his younger brother has been very intelligent since he was a child, but he is not good at riding and fighting. As long as I can seize the opportunity to rush to the past -<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is building her own army, brother. Really, I admire her, even early in the fight Wang Ling walked out of this step before, even if it was me, I did not expect it. When we were young, we got along so well, why did we go to this step, have to kill each other?" He said to withdraw backwards. Two steps, "For example, you are now, I just want a sword to split me in half?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know, brother. You are still the same as before, when you want to kill, your eyes will become terrible," Tiefco sighed. "I told you straightforwardly." Well, I want to stop the order of the king. Otherwise, five years later I will be the fleet of Garcia. She controlled the clear water port a few years ago, and Jinsuicheng is suitable for businessmen, but not suitable for raising. Warrior."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I need an army that is strong enough to withstand the army of the Sanmei Fleet, this is not A trade city can be realized. Gordon Wimbledon, you will be tried tomorrow because you are leaving the territory and stabbing the king. I have to return to Jin Suicheng tonight, and prepare for my father’s encounter with the east. I will be deeply saddened and will be reluctant to be crowned as the second heir to the throne. And you will be sent to the guillotine for the crime of the king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"You...!" Gordon yelled to the younger brother, but the distance was too far, his sword was intercepted by two armored guards, then the calf was numb, a short sword pierced With his calves, Goron suddenly lost his balance and fell to the ground. The crowd swarmed up and pressed him to the ground, tied to the bomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Judge? You are also qualified to judge me? I will say it all, let the person who supports you know what kind of monster you are!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course you will not, brother," Tiefco patiently said, "The Alchemy Square has a medicine called "forgetting", which is made up of lizard venom in the sands of the South. The milk is mixed and prepared. After drinking it, you will not be able to make any sound. Rest assured, it won't make you feel any pain, but it will be mellow and intoxicating. If you have to blame, blame our sister who was only that day, not her words, I will not go out of this step.

When I sit on the throne of the Grey Fort, I will complete our agreement. However... I saw my brother’s tragic appearance today, and I feel that some of the agreements should be accompanied by a guarantee clause. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bachelor's look changed immediately, "His Royal Highness, what you mean-"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Rest assured, I just don't want to be betrayed," Tefco pulled out a wax pill from his arms. "This thing must have been seen by you. It takes seven days for the wax shell to dissolve completely. It is almost my return to Wangcheng and Jinsuicheng. Time between. I used the price of the kingdom's chief astrologer to pull you over, but I don't want others to drive you out at a higher price. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness...you are laughing," the bachelor's face turned pale, and he bit his teeth and eventually ate the wax pill.<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smart choice," Tiefco nodded with satisfaction.
