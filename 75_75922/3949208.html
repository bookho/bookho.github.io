			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PS. Bringing today's update, by the way, pull the ticket to the "Starting Point" 515 Fan Festival, each person has 8 tickets, and the voting also sends the starting currency. I beg you to support and appreciate! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you better?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna patted Nana's back, her stomach It is also like a stock that is surging, but it is finally tolerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wounded were lifted up, the mind remained awake, and he repeatedly repeated, "Help me, save me..." Despair in the eyes I beg you to be sad. When she saw the intestine hanging from the stomach, Nanawa spit it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, she is determined to complete the treatment. After Brian helped put the intestines back into the wounded stomach, Nanawa reached out and closed her eyes with her eyes closed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hmm..." The little girl looked a little languid. She leaned on Anna and whispered. "The first time I heard the horn, my Highness "Is it in trouble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know," Anna shook her head. She wanted to go to the wall to look at it and fear that she would add Roland. She is now a little envious of the nightingale, the kind of silent action ability, it is very convenient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, there was a muffled sound in the direction of the wall, and everyone felt a slight shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian stood up and walked around in the room with some anxiety. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Easy, young man," Baron Pine swept his long sword. "It’s not calm before you go to the battlefield, it will only make bad results It’s worse. And, it’s still far from bad.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sorry, sir,” Brian replied, “I just thought someone was Fighting on the wall, but I was wasting time here, I felt that it was difficult to reassure. It is my duty to guard this town."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe," Pine shrugged. "But guarding the town is not your responsibility. After hearing the next winter, you will be a knight, then you should understand that the first principle of the knight is allegiance. Since he needs you to protect Anna, you will "You should do your duty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...say," Brian hesitated for a moment and then sat back in his seat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But very quickly, they heard the second horn screaming - more hurried than the first time, rolling over everyone's heart like a thunder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyan frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anna!" Nanawa exclaimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head and saw the witch walking straight toward the door, and Brian immediately caught up and stopped in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don’t you say you want to guard the city wall? It’s time," Anna calmly said. "As long as you follow me, it’s not against your highness. Command."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian really stunned, and he looked up and looked forward to the party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very good girl, the Baron thought, at least this sentence did not go wrong. Because the prince did not stipulate that she must stay in the hospital. And listening to Nana Va, she can summon the flame. If the situation is really tight now, the addition of a witch may have the effect of reversing the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, he nodded, "Protect her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Ryan suddenly got a spirit and replied loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the two leave, Nanawa asks: "Father, don't you go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "My battlefield is here, my daughter," the baron smiled. "No matter whether it is a beast or a devil, I will not let them hurt you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital is not far from the city wall, Anna and Brian trotting along the stone road along the wall to the east side, when the two went to the central watchtower, only to find that the situation has become very bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, it's dangerous here, you'll leave soon!" Someone saw Anna in a strange costume, and dissuaded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anna turned a deaf ear and walked straight toward the gap. After the evil beast rushed out of the crowd, he turned his direction and rushed directly toward Anna. As a guard, Brian rushed forward to grab the side, lower his body, and slash the sword. The mad beast had no intention of dodging. The front leg hit the sword front, and the long sword flew in the air, and the body's momentum would also The leg bones cut off the gap are broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It screamed and rolled over to the ground, struggling like a dehydrated fish, and no one dared to approach. Anna walked to the side of the evil beast and pressed her hands to the ground. The flame suddenly burst out of the evil beast and quickly baked it into a mass of coke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also noticed the sudden rise of the flame, when he found out that Anna was in person, the cold sweat was scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no such thing in your plan! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally intended to let Nanawa brush the militia’s goodwill, and after most people accepted the witch, they would reveal Anna’s existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that everything is late, he immediately turned his head and said, "Don’t worry about me, you can protect her!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anna must not lose, as an important person in place of the key process of industrial development, if she is injured, it will bring immeasurable losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know," said the Nightingale, "Please also pay attention to safety."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anna Before going to the broken wall of the city wall, Roland’s guards mostly saw this strangely dressed girl, and they let the position open. She stood in the shield wall and extended her arms to the sides. The flames are like vines, rushing out of the palms and climbing up the section of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the people who witnessed this wonder have grown up, and they can’t believe that a wall of flames slowly rises and fills up. The gap in the wall. This is by no means an illusion. The high temperature brought by the flames allows the guards at the break to retreat, and the surrounding snow melts rapidly, forming a white mist that rises. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil beast also felt the burning of the fire wall, they fled to both sides, and occasionally one or two boring heads rushed into the fire wall, but did not run out of two steps to die Fire sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone, on the wall!" Roland shouted, "The pike team reorganized the formation! Orion, free shooting!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, he grabbed Carter’s musket, boarded the wall, and shot himself at the evil beast that had no way to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince’s move immediately inspired people at the venue, and had to say that in this era, the nobility or the royal family’s deeds were few and far between. When the four princes' Roland was willing to fight with the militia team selected from the civilians, the morale boost was enormous. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd shouted the slogan of "guarding the border town! Fighting for the prince of the prince" and maintaining the line of defense in the unbroken shape of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle continued until the sky darkened, and there was no longer a living beast left in front of the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flames gradually dissipated, and Anna wiped the sweat from her forehead and walked out of the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Roland saw an incredible scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guards clenched their fists and bowed to her. After the militiamen were infected, no one shouted the word demon or enchantress, but watched her silently, and there was a brief silence on the border after the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A force that you have never seen before is really terrible, but when this power stands on your side and fights against evil enemies with yourself, fear will gradually disappear. Instead, it is trust and gratitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland strongly pressed his inner excitement and walked over to Anna, only to find that her face was pale, her steps were swaying, and her body was crumbling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are you okay?" He worriedly holding the girl's shoulders, the latter showing a reluctant smile to the prince, then carrying it in his arms . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
