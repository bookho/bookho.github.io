			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the dark corridor, riding the cage into the huge hollow deep in the ground, Mayn once again came to the front of the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'Brien is already waiting at the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks older than the last time, his eyes are sunken inward, and the wrinkles in his eyes spread like a spider web to the entire cheek, but his smile is still soft. Full of concern. Mayn couldn't help but look sore and stumbled in front of him. "Your Majesty, we--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get up, boy," the Pope's voice is flat Calm, "I heard that you are in trouble? Come to the hall to talk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is not the day of conversion, there is no long string in the hall along the foot of the wall Star-shaped candles, only a few candlesticks in a few corners. The pope sat back on the main seat and gasped. "Say, what happened outside."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean knows the duties of Oberlin He is not incapable of knowing the news outside the holy city, but has no time to pay attention to these trivial matters, so he will set up three bishops to jointly manage the educational affairs. I should try to avoid using these things to bother me, but now I am unable to solve the troublesome situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mean quickly told the story back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Heather is dead..." Oberlin was silent for a long time after listening, and sighed long. "A sharp, clever and pious little Girl, I watched her grow up slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Please mourn, kneel down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "The murderer will inevitably be punished," the pope nodded. "The situation is that Garcia and the Wolfheart Kingdom are helping each other? Is the new poison not working?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" played a miraculous effect when conquering the Broken Fort, the defenders forced a full back after a month, the trial army quickly broke into the city, the neighborhood almost could not see the living, but then attacked the wolf At the heart of the city, the poison did not seem to play the same role, and now the enemy’s resistance is still tenacious,” Meinhui reported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You made two mistakes," Oberlin said slowly. "The poison caused by the poison will die within seven to ten days. You should squat." Attacks at the peak of the first episode, and then quickly rescue the residents of the city, which can greatly reduce their hostility. Don't forget that we need as many people as possible, not an empty city."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The second point is to start after a month. Although it can minimize casualties, it can also give the enemy sufficient reaction time to find a way to cure the disease. The essence of the new poison is Enchanted evil beasts, according to the magical canon, there are more than 70 kinds of abilities to restrain its infection, more than 30 kinds of abilities can be directly killed, a city of tens of thousands, it is not strange to have such a witch "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You mean, they collude with the witch--"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All come to life and death At the juncture, who cares if they are the devil's minions," the Pope said quietly, "regardless of this witch. It’s not good news for the church to take the initiative to stand up, or to be exposed to the disease. If they can really block the momentum of our offensive, the reputation of the witch in the wolf will inevitably undergo a subversive change. Even... is regarded as a hero."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's all my fault," Mayn lowered his head in pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a mistake, but it's not serious. You also developed this strategy to reduce the damage of the Judges and the Prisoners," O'Brien used. The scepter knocked on his shoulder. "And the three kings of the Grey Fort and the Wolf King are in one place, and it is an opportunity for us."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...will?" The bishop yelled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the chance to get them all done," Oberlin stood up. "You come with me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the guidance of the guards, Mayn followed the pope out of the pivotal organs and slowly walked deep into the cave. The huge stone of divine punishment emits a dim light, illuminating the road under the feet of the people. - Gradually, the light is getting darker and darker, and Mayn can't help but look back, only to see that the secret temple and the god stone have been thrown far away. At the end of the day, the guards also ignited the torches to avoid being tripped by the gravel on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
