			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sea breeze is getting cold," looking at the marginal ocean, Garcia. Wimbledon licked the wind-blown hair, a little regret Say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because winter is coming soon," a handsome man behind her replied, "Although it belongs to the South, it is not a very southern place. The sand people don’t understand what winter is.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Our fleet can’t leave the port in winter, the current will make them difficult to move. So this time should be the last time "The woman turned back, "Farry, how long has the black sail been out?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two months and four days," the man said without hesitation "If there is no accident, they will arrive at the clear water port after three days."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garcia laughed. "I hope they will bring me enough surprises." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farion Coban looked at the woman who was arrogant, and felt very much in her heart. Her long gray hair reflects the silver in the autumn sun; the eyes are light green, the eyes are narrow, and there is an indescribable pressure when staring at people. Staying at the beach for a long time, her skin is slightly rough, not as white as the other women in the royal family, but Farion does not care. In his eyes, Garcia's temperament is enough to eclipse any beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the idiots that the close relatives of the Grey Fortress mate, the Wimbledon Three Kings are true geniuses. She has the wisdom and pride of the nobility, but she is not as conservative as the aristocrats. On this point, she is even a bit like a civilian. She is full of anticipation and adventurous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, no civilian has a height and vision like her, even the Duke and the prince are short-sighted in front of her. It is possible to invest all the trade income of the clear water port into the construction of the fleet. There is no coin left in the treasury. This is the point that the savior is far behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "These golden dragons have no meaning in the cabinet. When it is not used, it is like a stone. Only when you spend it can it reflect its own value. Key Therefore, spending it doesn't mean losing it. As long as you use it, you will get far more rewards than yourself." - Farion still remembers what she said to herself, almost like a slap in the face. It broke through the inherent concept that has been formed in his mind for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fareen feels that this is the ruler's demeanor compared to the royal aristocrats who have counted their savings and grown up all day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned his back to Garcia and followed her to Bishuigang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving here, Farion found out that his three kings did more than that - she not only had ideas but also actions. She developed a plan for the black sail around this core, and it was carried out step by step. As early as five years ago, the forces cultivated by Garcia had already infiltrated into the clear water port, preparing for the formation of the Black Sailing Team - and at that time, Wimbledon III had not yet made a war. In other words, she has already walked in front of all the heirs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go back to the house, the wind is getting bigger," Garcia said. Her palace is located at the southernmost tip of the clear water port, above the carp port. This tower-like building is like a watchman stationed on the coast. The top of the tower is a circular terrace with a wide view and a bird's eye view of the entire harbor and merchant ships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five years of operation, the trade in Bishui Port has begun to take shape, and a three-masted sailing ship will be launched every six months in the dock, and he also won The initial trust of the other party. Looking at the feelings of the three kings, Fryen hesitated to ask the biggest doubts in the past few months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, I don’t understand a bit," he closed the door and isolated the whistling sea breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said," she nodded with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why can the king predict this before the king has issued a war order?" He also wondered if Wimbledon III told her in advance. But when you carefully scrutinize it, you know that it is impossible. Everyone knows that the second prince is the most important heir to the king. The order for the king is precisely for him. This can be seen from the prince's land, Jin Suicheng. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess it all by myself and started the layout five years ago? The god is on, she was only eighteen years old! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
