			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland sat at his desk and wondered how to attack the Wangdu Palace, and the floor-to-ceiling window behind him suddenly heard the knocking sound of the touch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going back, I saw lightning flashing on the window, panic in the face, and McMug was on top of her head, slamming the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale just opened the window and the little girl flew into Roland’s arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong," he groaned. "What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Black scorpion scorpion! Huge snowy mountains!" Mai 茜 fell on the table, flapping his wings and reporting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said the lightning bolt, "It’s the devil, I saw the devil!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Roland looked serious. He touched each other's head and stabilized her emotions. "Don't panic, You said slowly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the lightning rose from the prince’s arms, and the golden short hair looked messy, and there were two around the eyelids. The light red mark of the circle is obviously pulled out by the windshield during high-speed flight. "I plan to draw the border of the hidden forest, and then go west along the Chishui River, and then I found a big mountain..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to her details and what he saw and heard, Roland couldn’t help but widen his eyes. The red mist on which the devil lives is behind the snow-capped mountains and away from the West. Only two hundred kilometers away? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the night, and the latter nodded. "I am going to call other sisters too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; An emergency meeting was held at the castle office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Roland retelled the situation of lightning discovery to the crowd, the witches who had experienced the night of the killings showed their uneasy feelings, especially the leaves, as their own hands. The witch who killed the two devils couldn't help but hold their mouth and whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, I suggest further exploration of the land covered by red fog," the book first opened. "After all, lightning just looked at a few distances." It is not certain that the devil will be under the red mist. Even if this is confirmed, it is necessary to detect whether they will cross the mountains facing the sea and reach the mainland of the kingdom along the coastline."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with the book's point of view," Wendy nodded. "Although they are very powerful, it is better to have prepared defense than to get rid of it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As the two oldest witches in the co-sponsorship, the book and Wendy have always been the backbone of many sisters. Although others are still a little scared, no one wants to sit still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland also tends to respond to this strategy. Seeing that everyone has not expressed any objection, things are basically settled. The key is how to implement it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Use a hot air balloon to investigate," Anna suggested. "Let the distant view cover the sky camouflage, cover the clouds and fly over the sea." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can also bring Sylvie," said the Nightingale. "It is a perfect fit for her ability to cope with this situation."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Roland nodded. "Additionally... I will go too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness!" His words were exported. Wendy, the book and the nightingales simultaneously stopped the road. "You can't take this risk yourself!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not an adventure," Roland waved his hand, "if They have the ability to leap into the sea or the mountains, and they should have spread all over the four kingdoms. The reason why they still gather in the far west is that the devil is not as terrible as he thought."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp There is another reason why he did not say it. He is more experienced than anyone in judging the development of a heterogeneous civilization - if you can see it with your own eyes. The devil and their cities, to develop the future development direction and engaged the strategy will be a great help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
