			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened in the mine collapse? You can say it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anny Head, start the narrative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland felt a little surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that the other party would be silent, would complain, or would curse, but she just answered her own questions and asked what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story is not complicated, Anna’s father is a miner who works in the mine when he lands. Anna, who got the news, immediately entered the mine with other miners’ families. The northern slope mining area is said to have been the nest of underground monsters. There are many winding roads in it, extending in all directions. Since the rescuers did not have a unified command, they would scatter their search after entering the hole. When Anna found her father, there were only neighbors' Susan and Uncle Anker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found that her father was crushed by a cart filled with ore and could not move, but a side of the miner was searching for the coins on his body. Seeing that his robbery was broken, the miner rushed up to knock Uncle Onker to the ground, and when he was ready to kill, Anna killed him first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighboring couple vowed not to tell her about the matter, and the three rescued Anna’s father together. But the next day, before dawn, Anna’s father went out with a cane and reported the daughter’s witch to the patrol guard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Roland heard this and couldn't help but turn around and ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barof sighed. "Probably for the bounty. Find and report the witch, you can get 25 gold dragons. For a person who broke his leg These 25 golden dragons are equivalent to the protection of the rest of the life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is silent for a moment, "The other is a strong and powerful adult man, how did you kill him?" ??<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Anna smiled. Just like the waves on the lake, the flame tip of the torch swayed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's the power of the devil you said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shut up! Demon girl!" The warden screamed, but anyone could hear the vibrato in his throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it? I want to see it." The four princes were unmoved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, this is not a joke!" The chief knight turned his head and frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland walked out from behind the knight and stepped forward to the cage. "If you are afraid, you can leave first. I didn't ask you to stay here."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't panic, she still has a lock of God's punishment on her neck!" Baro Gaofu comforted everyone, and it was like comforting himself. "The devil is no longer powerful and can't break God." The blessing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland and Anna standing in front of the prison rails are only one arm away, and he can clearly see the other side of the cheeks covered with dust and scars. The tender five senses mean that she is not yet mature, but her expression does not capture a trace of childishness. Not only that, but even angry is hard to find - this uncoordinated feeling Roland has only seen on TV. It was the appearance of a wandering orphan who suffered from poverty, hunger, cold and other sufferings. But not exactly the same, stray orphans always lick their bodies and face down when facing the camera, but Anna does not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until now, she still tried to stand up straight, her eyes raised slightly, and she stared straight into the prince’s eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not afraid of death, Roland realizes that she is waiting for death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you see the witch for the first time, adult? Your curiosity may kill you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's the power of the devil, you will suffer misfortune at a glance," Roland replied. "So you shouldn't be dead, but your father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of the cage suddenly changed, this time is definitely not an illusion, the flame seems to be suppressed, and soon there is only a small cluster. He heard the rapid breathing and prayers behind him, and the muffled sound of people accidentally falling down when they panicked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
