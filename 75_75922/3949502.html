			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Royal Highness, do you know who sent these people?" After Vader left, Carter asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With the pills, in addition to the church is Tefco, Garcia is now far from the gray fort, and it is unlikely to remember me." Roland sighed. "Tifficco is more likely than the former. He does not dare to send a large army to leave the capital now, but it does not mean that he will not retaliate against me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the attackers in these mixed people only carried the pills, and there was no body full of gunpowder. Otherwise, if you detonate in the crowd, the effort in these two months will be wasted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is not worried that the "death squad" he sent will threaten himself. On the days when the night is gone, he took more than ten guards wherever he went. Also wearing the stone of the gods. Not to mention the cockroach madman, even the superb witch is hard to get close to himself under the pressure of the ten-bar runner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found that when he was in the position of the lord for less than a year, his mentality has changed a lot. If you are here when you first arrive, it will be inevitable that you will feel that your legs are weak and you are overwhelmed. But just now, although he felt a little nervous, he could still pretend to be calm and self-confident. He knew that the guards would be in front of him and would stop the enemy, and he would not be the focus of the masses. The slightest gaffe, this idea is even surprised by himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Call the messenger group and ask them the detailed process of recruiting them," Roland said, turning to Barov. "I need to know this." Where did the individual board the sailboat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, Your Highness." The town hall manager looked a little gloomy, probably not expecting his own smugness. The man will actually commit such a major mistake, and he feels that there is no face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should not be too harsh on them, ask the situation first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After passing the checkpoint, Roland returned to the castle office. The news brought back by the messenger this time surprised him. In the southern part of the country, there were a large number of displaced people. The Eagle City and the clear water port were destroyed by war, and many fields outside the city were abandoned. Coupled with the strange weather this year, the temperature in the gray fort was plummeting, the price of food was rising, and even the price of slaves fell by half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he can establish a reliable transportation channel, these people can be continuously introduced into the West. In fact, according to the report of the Herald, I heard the side After the town’s recruitment and recruitment order, many refugees have begun to move spontaneously to the west. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the difficulty lies in the "transportation channel". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow of the demon moon covers the entire land transportation. If you want to bring people in, you can only transport it through the Chishui River, and there is only one ship in Bianbu Town. The township, where the witch can't move, is far from satisfying the demand – if there are ships all the time on the waterway, at least 20 riverboats will be built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the messenger group sent out this time has fallen into such a dilemma: only a small part of the Golden Dragon carried around is used to win the refugees, and the rest are mostly spent. Hire vessels and resettlers. At present, there are only 400 people who have arrived in Bianbu Town. There are still more than 3,000 people stranded in Liuye Town, Yinguang City and Chenglongling, waiting for the ship to be transported. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional owners are aware of the current situation in the West, raising the price very high, the light of more than 3,000 people, the estimated cost has been the last king The rescue of Dadu is flat, so it is not a long-term solution. Roland thought about the meeting and decided to send a letter of help to the Margaret Chamber of Commerce. He hoped that the other party could see the lightning, and would not report a price that was several times higher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you want to completely cut off this part of your expenses, you still have to build your own ship. Now the quality of steel and cement has been greatly improved, and it can be built to be stronger. The larger inland river punt, using the steam engine as a power to build this Chishui River traffic line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch, Barov knocked on the door and came in," His Royal Highness, the situation is almost clear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lun’s disciple was responsible for going to the north to win the refugees. On the way back, due to lack of shipping, he contacted friends who had met in Wangdu before, and hoped that they could help inquire or hire some merchant ships who are willing to go to the west.” Barov sighed, “ The news should have been revealed from here... He has placed the refugees in Silver City, but he is only half a day away from the king. It is not difficult for Tiffco to move his hands and feet."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
