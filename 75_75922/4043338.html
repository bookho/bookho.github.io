			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barryh Lothar is holding a glowing magic stone and stepping towards "black money" Deepest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a steep ramp, and even with the help of a servant, he was extremely difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, he is old, and there is a sadness in his heart. At the age of 20, he took over his family business from his father’s hands, and today he will make a chamber of commerce. Rich and enemies, the struggles and passions of this period are only clear to himself. Even if the title is only an honorable jazz, the reputation and status of the morning kingdom is not much worse than that of the Glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the achievements of the company do not mean that they can be passed on to future generations. In fact, as the scale of the Chamber of Commerce continues to expand, the foundation is already at stake. In order to consolidate the strength of the Chamber of Commerce, I joined a lot of businessmen who were quite large, even the upper aristocrats. When they were alive, were they reliable arms or pieces worthy of use, but after they died? Will they still be willing to stay in their current position? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question hardly needs to be answered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry has five sons and one daughter, the most outstanding of whom is Victoro Rosa, who is only 21 years old, even though he is already commercially The show reveals extraordinary talent, but this age is unlikely to hold back the partners of the tyrannical giants. The Chamber of Commerce is not a private property of the Lothar family. If Victor is forced to take over his position, I am afraid that it will be strongly countered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the Chamber of Commerce is a trivial matter, and his son may have a life worry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what about the behemoth that he has tried to create in his life? Barry is really not willing to do this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart is thinking, his feet suddenly slipped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Adult, be careful!" The servant around him immediately supported him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barry has adjusted several times before he regains his footing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously this body is no longer the energy of youth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is already sixty-nine years old, so how many times can the steep ramp be repeated? He has to hurry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he thought of God’s promise, Barry’s heart rekindled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only being a member of them can solve this seemingly unsolvable problem once and for all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The downhill gradually calmed down, and the air around it began to get wet. Barrych faintly heard the sound of the underground undercurrent impacting the stone wall, like a continuous thunder. , dull and honest. To be honest, he doesn't like such a place. Although it is secret enough, it can't give people a sense of security. He always worried that one day the water would rush to the cave wall and completely engulf it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there have been many similar situations in this cave group, and several passages have become deep pools due to groundwater inversion. Not closed up. "Black money" only occupies a small part of the cave group. If he can give Barry enough time, he can even make it a subterranean city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you reach the bottom of the slope, the light dims instantly - not the glowing magic stone is darkened, but the surrounding space has increased dramatically several times. It is no longer possible to illuminate the stone walls on either side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the groundwater flow becomes very loud here, as if a branch is passing under the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark hole ***The two groups of yellow light are flashing in the distance, that is the guardian sent by God to receive him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, you will be sent here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But adults, in front of There is a way..." The servant worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, I have to go by myself in the last part of the road." Barry slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
