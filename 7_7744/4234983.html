			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Augustin’s second close face-to-face with Queen Suele. After he pushed in, the Chief Secretary of State has gotten up, this treatment, the interior of the huge empire Only the emperor is the next person, but Augustine is obviously not clear about this, knowing that he will not be grateful to Dade. His gaze did not pay attention to the corner of the craftsmanship. The Titan War symbolizes the Raphaelic armor of the Odin squad, and there is no betting on the bookshelf behind her. Augustine looks at the most powerful woman in the empire, without Any feelings. The Queen of Gosher’s mouth twitched and did not sit down. Both of them stood. As far as height is concerned, the two are roughly equal, but on identity, I am afraid that only Augustine will really stand side by side with the three giants of the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice. Can be equal to the leader of the Academic Affairs Institute. If the new giant of the ruling is to write a list of the characters he hates most, then today’s status will exceed that of his chief secretary of state, and he will be able to rank in the top three, and the two empires will not be so beautiful. Looking at each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first female secretary of state of the empire first broke the silence. "I am sorry, I cannot treat the governor with black tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine calmly said: "If you have the opportunity to entertain the Secretary of State in the Ministry of the Holy See, I will personally give you a cup of black tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Queen Gesell smiled and said, "I am looking forward to it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine no longer speaks. Quietly waiting for her to unveil the prelude of the storm. She and he are both the same character, and will not easily unveil the cards at the table until the fruit of victory is determined. Therefore, the two crises of the seedling order, the winners are the young masters of the poetry song castle, rather than the two guests who are very optimistic about the Grizzly gambling. Only this time, Augustine is in an absolute disadvantage of a weak chance of winning. Queen Gesser finally sat down with her hands on her gang and whispered: "The Emperor’s Majesty has just discussed with several imperial army leaders who rushed to the Imperial Palace Chamber to discuss the cross-era reforms brought about by a certain topic. You are the core figure of this topic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core character is excluded, and her subtext is easy to understand. The trust of His Majesty the Emperor seems to be very limited. Augustine sneered, are you playing a cat and catching mice and then slowly teasing the game? However, the Queen does not seem to have the favor of the ordinary aristocrats. It is straightforward to open up the mystery of Augustine's confusion. With a unique cold voice, "The ruling lord, you show the ability of * transmission in front of Marquis de Todd in Lancôme Castle. I have inquired a lot of confidential information through the Imperial Magic Guild. This skill that can be classified as a magical genre is only theoretically possible. I believe that it is named as a demigod by some black magic fragments. Advent, so I united some generals to elaborate on the emperor’s empire. If this kind of advent can be magnified, it will bring the far-reaching significance of the war. The result of discussion between the emperor’s and the generals is that even if they can only come at the same time each time. People, the maximum interval is temporarily set to a quarter of an hour, will have a decisive impact on a battle of 10,000 people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine had to take a deep breath to ease the violent temper in his heart. It turned out to be this abominable loophole. He never imagined the pulse and the advent of the war, because the pulse is probably the most talkative in the world. The one who rightly said clearly that there is a double upper limit of energy and direction through two pulse points. Simply put, there is no possibility of transmitting dozens of people at a time, and the super long distance of the individual comes, for example The kind of "miracle" that spans half of the epic continent can only be done by a powerful magician with a half-god, and Augustine has doubts about the existence of such a demigod. But his disappointing explanation, will the fanatical generals believe it? It’s not a pacifist. In order to cultivate the elite knight who competes with the Titans, he is the master of the throne of the Saxon forest meat grinder. Will the Emperor who has been tirelessly pursuing the key to victory in these years believe? The answer is even if you think about it with a fool's ass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the youth delinquent deliberately suppressing and hiding the look, Queen Gesell did not reveal the gloating glory of the winner, but slowly said: I have consulted with scholars such as Saint Jerome and Dean of St. Carroll about the coming, and today I have just given a vague fact that the generals are very lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine is puzzled, what is the number one enemy on the counter? Behind the smile brew a bigger plot? Otherwise, it will not always show him good or show weakness. The Chief Secretary of State suddenly pointed to a collection of poems on the table, "The Eyes of the Blind," a simple epic that was nicknamed "Homer's Epic" by the province of Richelieu. The queen said lightly: "Augustin, whether you believe it or not, I don't want to prove anything through some disgraceful means. These things, maybe Windsor and Rothschild are good at it, but I won't do it. I invite you to the Academic Affairs Council today, not to show off the power of me or the Academic Affairs Court, but to pay tribute to the enemy who has a great sorrow from the Cavaliers. However, if there is a chance next time, I will definitely not hesitate. Personally ask for the head of the Grand Judiciary and ask you a long question."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a javelin stands upright Augustine opposite the Queen of Chessier Smiled: "I am very moved by the Secretary of State's fair spirit. It seems that next time I invite you to the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice, I have to hand you a cup of black tea, and then I have to be alone, face to face in the bed to ask you."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State is awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin turned and left, and went to the door. "I personally like the taste of the Secretary of State, wearing a pair of scorpion glasses that would never be imitated. A little homemade, white rose fragrance with a slight adjustment of the top, middle and tail notes. It is very poetic to chat with such a sister on the bed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of the song, who was actually "tucked" by a man, was not angry, not surprised, just laughing, whispered: "Don't send it. Also, I hope that next time I don't take a lecch to enter the Academic Dean. Even if it is At the prince level, the Academic Affairs Office also has enough power to drag it into the sun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin chuckled out of the room and walked out of the classroom, in the square, Don't forget to wave goodbye to a woman standing in the window position. Letting her sit back in the position, she smiled slightly. She held the gang with one hand and spread a copy of the "Blind Eyes" at the end of the book. She said to herself: "Old Hall Ji Jude, this Is it your so-called young Augustine who is full of aristocratic spirit? Oh, it’s quite a bit like it’s quite funny, and quite 'gentle'.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She re-entered her heavy business. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sister?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen broke the quill that was ready to sign a sub-document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introducing a guy who once became public and became the most sensational in the empire, just stepped out of the Senate and saw two familiar guys who had not seen for many years, one An old man with an unusually handsome face, no badges on his body, and a curly-aged peer in a rare mage robe. Augustine stepped forward and seemed to want to give them a warm hug, and they also catered to this. The welcome ceremony, the scene of returning is very touching. Only when the distance is less than one meter, the three men almost stretched out their fists and thighs at the same time, and they smashed each other with arbitrarily punching and kicking. Unfortunately, Augustine, who was madly rushing to the full professional master, took a big profit, with only one face. The young man who can make the ladies screaming was almost squatted, and the young man of the magician also bent his chest with a painful chest. He carefully wrapped his wings and tightened his thighs to protect the important parts of his aunt. Augustine is a The non-courteous shit aristocrats, even the scorpion still did not let go, the three finally joined hands side by side, laughing and laughing, obviously, these two young people do not care about the plague of the Emperor Augustine, the public enemy of the emperor, but also Who made them two are the heirs of the Pompeii family, and even the first of the Jupiter City, who survived the Caesars’ Gate of Honor, was the first son of Jupiter, the young master of Nero, and the other was the death of Saint Iyita. The Dean of the Monastery of Odea, the only student of the old man, studied York in the torch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of them were in the same year, but there was a hardcore hangover in the air monastery, day and night, copying the scriptures and secretly visiting the tragic friendship of the Danube The buddies, everyone knows that the Danube has the most flamboyant and enchanting girl in the empire. The nobles who have never been there to taste the feminine taste of the Tamei Gallery will be persuaded by the returning nobles to persuade the Caesar gold coins in their pockets. There is a paradise for men, especially those who do not lack money! The magical genius young man who was first deceived by two nobles and swindled into the Danube boat always complained about how the shameless Nero was telling at the time that there was a girl who longed for the pure land, and what was needed, and the treacherous Augustine How did he deliberately block the sign that "only six gold coins are good for one night" at the door, but fortunately he just talked with the girl about the "The Transformation of the Eucharist" and "The Sardinian Doctrine" and succeeded. Convincing her to donate ten silver coins to the church anonymously every year, but fortunately, York is inevitably a little quietly lost. If that night, I would know more about some of the ladies dressed as nuns. Who knows? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man, Nero, glanced at the gate of the Academic Affairs Center and asked, "How, Augustine, to visit the most attractive woman in the Empire? Hey, she looks like a uniform in the Academy, but it is charming enough."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin said: "The next time I meet her, I will help you convey this compliment without a word."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Nero rolled his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York complained: "The rules of the torch are too harsh. I need to pass the six or seven approvals once I come out. And Gaka went out shopping, but didn't listen. Say she needs someone to nod."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin glared at his shoulder and walked to the Nero Master, which was more than one or two levels of luxury than Ms. The carriage, comforting said: "York, you are a generation of Ola monks, to be able to tolerate some worldly bad habits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York also turned a blind eye. All the "bad habits" in him were learned from the two nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to my house?" After getting on the carriage, Nero asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the antler tavern in Jonathan, I made an appointment with Kraft’s Octavian to drink." Augustine laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drinking? The professor in the torch will definitely let me write a review of thousands of words!" York bitterly said, although the consequences are serious, but in the words The proposal was not rejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"York, you are the student of Dean Ola, you are a bit guilty. Isn’t the Dean told you that there are more young people? If you make a mistake, can you have a good memory of your old age?" Augustine slaps on the head of York. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York hurriedly tidying up his hair: "Don't say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is very good According to the good deeds, "That must have been forgotten by the Dean. In the Ola, I and Nero have heard the warning from the Dean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lu immediately echoed: "Yes, I heard that I was sitting in the workshop while sitting next to the Dean, and I have heard it more than once!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York snorted and looked at the faces of two friends. It is only a matter of sincerity and sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innocent and poor York. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the most attractive antler tavern in Jonathan, it’s full of horse-drawn carriages that come from far and near, and there’s no shortage of famous cars and badges. The carriages of the husband's family are outstanding regardless of the time and place. They follow the same principle as Augustine's so-called world. The more prominent the car, the more successful the pub will be placed outside the pub. Location, it is coincidental that the Naughty Master’s Pompeii family carriage was arranged next to Clough. Both families have the most unreasonable arrogance of the empire, filled with neuroticism that the general family cannot understand, otherwise the Duke of Pompey also It will not let the beautiful son, who is only 12 years old, go to Saxon Forest to witness the battle in the first line, and let the young man personally go up the penalty platform and cut the sword to the head of the prisoner of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pub has three floors, but except for a few hidden rooms, the seats will not be defined by identity, because no aristocratic gentlemen and wealthy businessmen who can come here to consume Lack of money, no one wants to drink a wine, feel the dwarf, and the pub will be free to entertain some court literati and bards, especially the informal lady, the antler is not the most delicious afternoon tea pastry, Therefore, the business of the antlers has been hot, and it is necessary to reserve a position to sit down for a comfortable afternoon or dusk. Not to mention the place not far from the antlers, the most abundant Haitang Street in the Empire night show, not only rich men can find all kinds of pastimes there, but also women, they can also find the corresponding special services that they can meet, they can pass the wall behind the scenes. The small hole picks the naked handsome man. The master in the name of the lady salon will select the age, appearance, and even nationality of the man according to their requirements. After paying a certain amount of gold, they are shy or worried about the disclosure of identity. You can wear a variety of goddess masks carefully created by the owner, and a naked communication with men on the comfortable bed. Their husbands obviously do not let them fatigue the strength of their legs, so they are often able to get gold coins. The equivalent return, willing to linger, forget to squander the gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Uttar Pradesh Antlers is very simple, that is, drinking, there is the most abundant wine cellar in the Imperial City, just call out the name, you can drink. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Big Dragon Gun Knight didn’t like Ner’s playing the music and seduce the ladies, but he didn’t take the table when he was on the face of Little Augustine. People, just watching this playboy in the aristocratic circle drink a whole bottle of Soviet spirits, and can still hold a bottle with his tongue without curling up. Octavian thinks this guy is good, at least it is qualified. The drinker, as for the young man with the curly hair, will be inferior, only the cup of antlers and the most milfs of the mimosa will be red, and the face will be red, and the little Augustine is the same as the previous times. More, but always able to accompany him to drink and enjoy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon York was faint and drunk and snoring on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nero's youngest is interested in the window to look at the servant's maid as a good wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houseview looks at the sober Augustine and whispers: "Little Augustine, the Secretary of State is not difficult for you?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine shook his head and said: "No. On the contrary, like a goddess holding a fair scale. If possible, I don't mind being nailed to the tripod and ask her to have a drink."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Da Dawei smiled and said, "Don't forget to call me to drink together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustine laughed: "As long as you don't worry about going home, you will be punished by Mrs. Richmond for a whole day, and you will be ordered to copy a hundred times of knight virtues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Da Dawei's face is bitter, and when he encounters a headache, he will habitually wipe out a beard and sigh with a sigh. But soon the optimist knight resumed his smile and said: "I used to hate me for the antlers, but I heard that after you have been a companion today, I not only promised, but also specially gave me a large bag of Caesar gold coins, saying It doesn't matter if I go home later. I can see that she is very satisfied with your little Kraft's godfather. Little Augustine, I know, you are my gospel, you should really go to the battlefield with me and cut it together. Enemy's head, break their spears and win all the knight badges together!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is also a bit strange about the transformation of Mrs. Richmond, the last time she entered Kraft The house, he can also feel keenly aware of her hidden hostility. In the face of the invitation of Octavian, he shook his head and said: "Our battlefield is different."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Da Dawei pulled away the scorpion: "How come? Not the same, I know very early that you are the butcher of the night watch! Kepler gallows battle, how many heresy heads you broke, forty? 50? Or one hundred? Little Augustine, you would have been The successor to the Earl of Juggernaut!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin punches the head of the big dragon gun knight, "You give me a small voice."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Da Dawei shut up in a bitter, and looked pitiful with his identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
