			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the twilight, Augustine and Nero York squatted on the street of Jerran, Jonathan Street, a famous mile long ramp that stood at the bottom of the hill Walking up, especially in the snow-covered winter, is like going to heaven, so it is known as the saint path, and when York is halfway, he rushes to the street and spits three times, while vomiting and repenting, seeing Augustine and Ni Lu is not laughing, but in the boyhood where the family hope and the burden of the badge can be left behind, the two nobles have been bullying York as the only hobby of suffering life, praying several times a day and copying the sage under the lamp. Our ancient scriptures are far from a little bit of fun. The Big Dragon Gun Knight did not take Augustine to drink drunk and let go of three young people. Under the advice of Nero, three young people of the same age who had reunited for a long time began to roll the streets. When they reached the top, they squatted together. Nero whispered: "Augustin, there is a fox hunting event tomorrow. The number of participants is not too many, but they are all the first-line family members of the Imperial City and a group of young heirs who have some reputations, and one of them is born like you. How about Aphrodite and Constantine, how are you interested in playing? I can hear that before you left home, I exchanged love with the lady of the North Ouwufu family. Keeping things, if you remember correctly, you replaced a peach horse that was raised with one hand for a horse that he raised himself. Hey, more touching, I want to create a lyric for you for free. If you are willing to participate, I will cancel an established itinerary for tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wokeing a little bit of York, I don’t understand the situation: "How do I hear about this? Florid and Prince Schopenhauer Did Napoleon's priests go near?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin didn't have any sadness, just swearing at the corner of his mouth: "Does girls not like Prince Charming and Knight Heroes? York If you are a young lady, would you like a groom or a butcher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York is a serious man: "I am a normal male magician. I can't understand you. The girl’s feelings hanging on my lips, the prince, the princess, or something, I have never touched it. I only know a nobleman who likes to be close to me, a magician, and there is nothing to say. The abbots who abducted the ignorant girl. These two bastards have no good reputation in Jupiter City, and it is a misfortune to know them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nero strikes: "Accurately, you are a 22-year-old pure male magician who still doesn't know the taste of women. It's so pure that you can touch the heresy. Also, York, if you go to the streets, call me. Sleeping with the handsome Master Nero A small bed, or go to St. Carroll, say that you like to compete with the new governor of the Ministry of the Ministry of Augustin for a veal lunch to see who doesn't treat you as a big man? Oh, I almost forgot, when Miss Cara was wonderful. The first time I arrived at Voda Aura, you stared at her two beautiful legs, but they were not burnt into a roast pig. This made the idiots in the torch who were arrogant but lying in the medical room accept the fate. Unfair?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York muttered a few words of symbolic protest. He was not stupid enough to quarrel with a guy who could win countless flowers on a confession in Caesar's Grand Gate Square. Not to argue with Nero, not to fight with Augustine, is the two painful education that has been unfortunately made many times in previous years. Of course, for mere magicians, these unpleasant memories are the warm colors that are rare in his old-fashioned gray age. If it weren't for the two noble heirs that he hated at first, he would have been a "scorpion in life" who only knew how to follow the teacher's rote magic formula, and even more could not integrate into the life of the emperor. Today, he can only become a lonely monster of the torch. Tire, York has always been proud that Augustine taught him how to raise a top grade eagle, he still remembers that the torch of the group of aristocrats saw the shock of his foreign countrymates who were skilled in commanding Bai Wenpu, especially when others were curious to ask why a pulse The Deola monk was able to raise the eagle owl. He used the godfather of Augustine, the first dean of the air monastery, Saint Iyita, to say, "Alehan said, I will be like an eagle guardian Ola after death." It has won unprecedented condescending envy and awe, which allowed the ancestors of York to take root in the torch. After the Luotong Chaid family was removed from the imperial aristocracy, York and all the dynasty Similarly, without any change in the perception of Augustine, before John walked out of the monastery, he replaced Saint Iyita as the dean’s old To him privately told before, do not forget some valuable friendships. So the first time that York wrote a review book was because he heard the arrogant Constantine in the torch telling about Augustine’s bad words, and then he said that he had smashed a super-large magical flame corridor of up to 58 levels. I heard that the dean of this matter was only taken in a regular letter, written in a rare humorous tone. "It seems that your nuclear capacity has yet to be improved, and the next time you try to lose more than 60." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin finally remembered Nero’s first question and replied: “The fox hunting will not go, I don’t have a fox terrier, let alone the price. The city’s arctic bells are hunting kennels. Nero, don’t forget, I’m not a nobleman, fox hunting is not allowed by imperial law, and hunting rabbits is fine.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Nile regrets: "Don't play with me! Augustine, who are you? I don't know? Hey, you really don't want the lady with the head of the Empire to fall into remorse?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shook his head and said: "This is not realistic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero sighed and said: "She It’s a bitch!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin softly said: “The rose thorn in your heart, not the same look is not good?”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero bitterly, sighing, and sighing, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin patted the shoulder of the most controversial aristocratic young man in the imperial capital, laughing: "To women, especially pretty women. Say, time is more ruthless than any enemy. If you hate a woman, then try to live for a few more years, and then when she is old, a young mistress walks up to her and gently says that you are ugly. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero whispered: "Really gentle. Really cruel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;York can't help Ruan said: "The real aristocracy, really shameless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three people laughed together, the quiet streets of Weierlan, pierced by laughter. And when will the sacred empire in the rise be pierced by the golden triangle of the heresy giant, the chief marshal of the empire, and the holy magician? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what, these three young people who have spent their youth together in the monastery tonight are destined to crowd in a big bed at the roadside hotel, next door It was the Jonathan niece gathering place that was praised by the nobility as "the night never sleeps". You can hear the beautiful and inspiring strings. On the big bed, the three people discussed a very serious and academic topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A handsome guy who doesn’t spend a piece of copper can let Jonathan’s girl devote himself to the ceiling and gently said: “Augustin, York, I still have some gold coins. About 30 Caesar, do you want to find a few middle-priced girls?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a nobleman but at least a handsome monk guy: "" Jonathan is so expensive? Ten Caesars are medium-looking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, otherwise, how is the emperor, there are too many fools like you." The influx came in and lifted the price. Now the middle-aged aristocrats in Jupiter City are complaining, and they want to get an injunction for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk is as pitiful Looking at the ceiling, "I knew that I would borrow a little gold coin from Octavian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the young wizard who claimed to be pure suggested: "Why don't you say Just find one of the most senior prostitutes, then take turns?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& Nbsp; The handsome aristocrat stunned, pretending to be terrified: "York, you are really heavy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest of the saints of the Knights of the Holy Spirit is attached: "It is more perverted than the old aristocracy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician who is in the root of the wall is angry and angry, "I mean you, no. Say I want to participate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you really want to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really want to!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "York, didn't you find a part of your sheet raised?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a pure sight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You both get out of bed!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Augustine, fortunately I slept outside, you have to be careful. York's spear is obviously eager to try."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nero, you don't always say better than me Handsome, I believe that York will make the right choice, and I don’t mind helping him when I get there.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magician begins to meditate on a large array of magic spells . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his snoring, the other two allies with the same godfather accompanied the pleasing strings of the next street, whispering all night, talking about women, Talk about war, talk about politics, talk about everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, when York woke up, the three made a long-awaited common prayer, and then Nero and Augustine first sent York to the gate of St. Gallen College. In the end, Nero, who is going to follow the father’s father to the frontiers of the Empire, will send Augustine to the Count of Clough. This is a super-class aristocratic heir of the empire that was placed in high hopes after the boyhood, but only after the degeneration of Ola, and finally reached out. Out of the Pompeii family's unique bloody teeth, on the border with the Titans, gathered aristocratic generals headed by major military leaders, as well as the rising star of the barbarian Greenspan, more hidden in the war like the sissy Helen. The shadow of the speculators, and of course the fat knights led by the fat man Rhein Hathad, consisting of countless chaotic aristocratic descendants, has a large number of just to watch the war scenes in order to return to their respective provinces and provinces to brag about how to heroically kill the enemy performers. Nero didn't let Augustine go to see him. The bright and beautiful face was hung with a dazzling smile. He said with his only true friend: "In the future, you will be the godfather of me and the York children, and I will be you." The best man of the two guys, this is the agreement made in the O'Dola. So, Augustine, we don't die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before leaving, Nero took out the gift that had been prepared as early as the car to Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a labyrinth box made up of clumps of building blocks. To open, you need good intelligence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All morning, sitting in the Clough Garden, Augustine is racking his brains to open the box. Before lunch, he was finally opened by Augustine. He was originally prepared to use the axe to knock on the abominable maze of the nickname gold wool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the common taste of the most discerning and top-notch top collectors? It is not a vulgar jewel, not a rare porcelain, not a heretical specimen that is rejected by the orthodox, but an apostolic playing card that has always become the biggest puzzle of the epic continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one apostle playing card in the Golden Wool Labyrinth box, and a yellowed book fragment that has been torn from a certain document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 55 cards, the heart symbolizes the war with blood, the spades represent deep wisdom, the plum means peace and women, the square is power Each color has 13 cards, 10 letters and 3 head cards. The red letters are the most powerful army or Knights badge on the mainland, with the Titan Empire occupying the most seats. Plum blossoms have the most famous symbols of every seminary and monastery, and the Holy Empire has no doubt that the next apostolic poker will be added to the air monastery. J, Q, K, each of the four colors has three head cards, a total of twelve, painted with the characters on the epic continent standing on the peak. Plus the last three, the apex of heresy: the black emperor; the father of the spirit of the mainland: the white emperor; and if the vacant person is chosen, there will be a blank queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement of the apostolic playing cards for twenty years, the last time in the 821th year of the Holy Calendar, that year, the emperor of the Holy Empire returned to the square after two hundred years. The head card, the "razor theologian" Saxon, who was judged by the white emperor of the thousand-year-old Pope by the Byzantine Pope, fled to the Camry Empire and became the latest black emperor. The Queen of the Card, after smashing dozens of royal members with the same blood relationship in one breath, became a box Q, one higher than Jupiter the Great J. Still in the white rose dynasty of the spades, her emperor's majesty was completely abandoned by the apostle's playing cards. The young emperor who was scared to hide in the quilt by the singer was screaming and thundering. Even the white rose aristocrats were scornful and had to worry about the future of the dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
