			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missell Hill, in terms of height, is closer to the starry sky than the Temple of Olympia, where two are in secret magic books The most mentioned magical building, the silent square in the two is more famous, because it is almost the most grand manifestation in the history of human architecture, comparable to the intuitive shock brought by a war, it has three gods standing in the triangle The statue of 祗, the "will" eye is inlaid with the Saint-Carroll of the Nibelon-root heart; the thinker St. Peter who looked down at the book; holding the staff to look at the sacred St. Taylor. It constitutes the most basic magic circle of the three-pointed star. Under this magical array, there is an engraving pattern that is more than a thousand times more than the super-combination of the magical array of the magical empire. It is the most vast book, recorded. With all the wisdom of human beings since the victory of the dragon, in addition to documenting the magical array, the silent square will also engrave the last words of every temple practitioner, or the most beneficial argument for human and magic in the generation. Observed and trampled by latecomers, meaning profound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first candidate in the history of Maya to ride the dragon to the temple, the young female magician Gaga Wonder has been lingering in the square for one month and night, even It was in the square, and it was not a word. This kind of state, which is not only devout but also neurotic, has always been maintained. She even refused to meet with the Maya's top ten council. Today, Old Gold once again came to the Silent Square, watching the young woman quietly leaning on the base of St. Peter's statue and looking up at the female will, St. Carroll, who opened the "will". She put the book on the knee. Cher's "Forbidden Zone." Old Gold walked over and sat next to her. He was probably the only predecessor in the temple who was willing to chat with this younger generation. Of course, Old Gold did not communicate with people for too long, and the old aristocratic identity brought in the world. Some of the advantages have faded. Today, Old Gold is just a centenarian who is not talkative. He does not expect this child to talk to him. He said to himself: "Gaga is wonderful, you are not at your feet. The highest point of our world. Standing on the shoulders of the sage giants, to win the crown of magic, every magician needs to climb beyond the ability. This is the meaning of the existence of the sky above the head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lady who never talked to the temple after she arrived at the temple licked her dry lips and smiled and said: "In my hometown, there is a fool who said the same meaning. He also said The world of each of us is a circle of circles. When you draw a bigger circle, you will be more curious and more afraid of the unknown field outside the circle. So I always think that he is a stupid magician, but a clever nobleman. ""<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Gold nodded lightly and took it for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young and terrible woman in the temple was slightly sad: "I never knew if he was happy or lonely when he arranged tens of thousands of dominoes. He wouldn't think of someone when he prayed at the Monastery of Ola. Some people, when copying the scriptures with the old people, will feel dull and boring. The elegant Duchess tells me that wisdom is not necessarily wisdom, but wisdom is definitely smart, knowing this truth, is a qualified lady, However, Old Gold, when I am out of here, does it take twenty years or more, when I am already an ugly old woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Gode ​​smiled. "I don't think so, youth will especially favor you like this lady."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl turned to look at a white old man, smiled slightly : "Old Gold, thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man shook his head and said: "As long as you can keep working hard and hard, give us the old man one by one. Surprise, that is the best Thanks. But Gaga, Old Gold doesn't want you to be proud, because many people who have been to Michel and the temple have made a lot of unimaginable feats. Even, they have never been recorded by Maya, like my teacher. No matter what kind of glory, she always insists on the belief in her heart. Old Gold hopes that you will become a magician like her in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded "In Longmai, Carape told me about her deeds. In the era when my grandfather was still not born, she was already strong enough to expel Black Dragon Dandong from the Dragon Nest, and finally made this seriously wounded dragon fall on In the territory of the White Rose Dynasty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man fell into deep memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She blinked and asked: "I have been pursuing her as a goal all these years. Old Gold, I said, you won't be angry." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Gold is laughing and laughing, it seems that because he has found a confidant, he is more and more willing to talk and chat: "Of course not, my teacher is very Hope is overtaken, she doesn't like others' look up at all. I remember when I was young, she was sitting in the same place as you, pointing to the statue of St. Carol and telling me that the real meaning of the gods lies in the guidance. It’s just that many people have forgotten this. At least some of our unskilled students have disappointed her without exception. So Old Gold hopes that Miss Gaga will be able to break the record of this Mayan temple. Hey, leaking a little secret to you, there are many old guys in the ten-member council who are very worried about the teacher, because she did more 'excessive' than you, and refused to create countless ones from her. The new magic array engraved the request on the square, which is silent It’s a pity, isn’t it? It’s very hard for you to target her. Old Gold is probably not living that day. Haha, so, Miss Gaga will not be angry?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl smiled and smiled. She smiled, and once she smiled, she always had the most fascinating scenery. She erected a book with a yellowed mottled cover, looked at the chin, looked into the distance, and screamed for a long time. Finally, she said: Old Gold, if one day I miss my hometown, riding the dragon to leave the Maya Mountains, will you be angry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Gold snorted, softly Road: "The temple will be angry, but the old God can not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lady who wears a family badge jumps down the base of the statue and turns to the old man Wave goodbye and continue to go to the center of the square to copy a magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her jumping movements are light and elegant, just like she jumped from the top of the giant faucet, which is memorable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Gode said with emotion: "Young is so good. Riding a dragon to see a loved one? Which bastard has this treatment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two emperors are very lively, and a large number of generals and nobles When I rushed to the southern border, whenever the time came, the city would spring up a lot of leaflets that promoted the tyrannical cruelty of the Titans. On the streets, there were high horses, horses sitting on the horses with bright armored empires, and on the balcony, next to the streets. A lady who stands and looks at her lover and lovers. The Dalong Gun Knight House Dawei has dozens of family-riding grand knights arranged outside the Earl's Court. He holds a bouquet of roses picked up by his son from the garden. Is there a warmer fare than this? The ugly house is difficult to hide his excitement. His vision is from the respected father, his friend Little Augustine, his beloved son, and finally his wife. He nodded slightly, crossed his arms to the chest, bent slightly, and left. . Augustine touched the head of the godson and whispered: "Little Kraft, your father is not good at poetry, but blowing the song on the battlefield is the most touching collection of poems. The father of the godfather, not good at killing the enemy, but the pen in his hand, They can fight for their families. They are the bravest fathers in the world. Little Kraft, you are still young, you don't need to rush to choose a rifle or a quill. When you are older, you naturally know what you need to pick up. The godfather believes that you will make the right choice. By the time the godfather, your parents, your grandfather, will support you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care in the old Clough Abbey Mrs. Richmond, who was "squatting" during the period and trying to change this ancient family according to her own wishes, was slightly thoughtless and slightly twilight. When the old master gave the poems and songs to the castle, 120 people from the knight and a million Caesar, caused an uproar in the family. The savvy family members led by her directly dismissed them at the Kraft family meeting. In the end, the old Kraft had to take out many years. The style that has not been shown is forced to pass the resolution under the pretext of private name. It is only a huge amount of gold coins, and the old count has to use his own small treasury. For all of this, Mrs. Richmond still does not regret it, but she has only seen the Zihua guest who only retains the status of ordinary priest, and there are a few more unspeakable embarrassments in her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine and the old count had afternoon tea in the garden, and Mrs. Richmond personally cooked a pot of Ceylon black tea, and left it with Little Clough, which gave the empire a cold and unfamiliar home with a warm atmosphere. Just like the warmth of the winter sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count squinted and smirked: "Augustin, I can hear that a masked female knight has reappeared in Saxon Forest for a new round. The jihad caused no small trouble. Why, the Black Swan Lake slipped away a swan?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin installed a stupid saying: "Maybe the great heresy Andre has Two daughters? The poem can't escape a fly, let alone a swan with a female double professional identity. She is a pretty moving lady. Helen Helen made a small misunderstanding. The fool will let go of the black swan worth more than 1.2 million Caesar coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man smiled, no Do judge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Richmond overslept, somewhat helpless. She wondered if she was left with a small mistake, and she really couldn’t expect the Lord Architect and the Count of the Vampire to have an elegant taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count transferred the topic: "Augustin, did you hear the most horrible story of the epic continent written by the Queen of the Monkey? Not only defeated the gathering in the bell Forty thousand aliens outside the fortress, and for the first time in recent decades, they took the initiative to kill more than 20 tribes. There was no living place in the place where they passed. It seems that at that time there were several Principalityes Fortunately, at least in addition to the unfortunate noble kings and noble knights, the civilians did not suffer too much damage. I heard that our emperor’s majesty clearly expressed his admiration and prepared to send an envoy to the outside of Ahhim. The land of the far north has taken the initiative to share the ruling power of the new Gospel continent. Maybe it will form a sacred offensive and defensive alliance, which is a new poem for the Empire and Kamo. I believe the Titan must not see this result. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine hesitated and said: "I heard that, but what really makes me feel terrible is not the ridiculous iron ride, but the queen." behave The potential dominance has almost infiltrated politics, military and culture. She said that it is impossible for a generation to change an empire, but she can make the first change and then develop a qualified heir to the country. Keeping a benign inertia sprint, can we imagine how a card is a hundred years later? This imprisoned lion can't stay at the origin forever, let the epic continent glory and watch it. Tragic fate. Like our empire, a sleeping lion will not fight forever."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine hesitated again. "She has shown a forward-looking nature beyond our world for at least a century. We have formed an offensive and defensive alliance with such an ambitious country, perhaps not a move that will benefit the long-term interests of the Holy Empire."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Richmond is full of surprises and wants to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin ridiculed himself: "I am a pessimist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count laughed: "This can't be heard by the court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled bitterly: "Yes, especially under this emperor, I have some doubts about my heart." Sensitive moments. His Highness the Secretary of State seems to have taken the initiative to let me go to the jury, but she still won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Richmond seems very Curious about this wonderful dark battle hidden deep under the countertop, once again turned to look at this family priest who leisurely tasted black tea. But the two men who were separated by two generations quickly turned to a discussion that made the lady laugh and laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Augustine, how do you write my personal biography?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Preface I thought about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak and listen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe text is not so Beautiful. And will let most aristocratic readers see the beginning and throw it away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, I am mentally prepared, if I want to be beautiful, I was Promise that the Emperor hired a court poet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The beginning is roughly like this: the last Kraft owner asked Pon Longner of the youth: son, you How can I take someone else’s bride away from the wedding? This young man said that I am more handsome than the groom. After many years, after being punishable by the imperial empire, the emperor asked: The Peng Long, who changed from the Marquis to the Earl overnight Na, do you regret the mistakes made? This middle-aged man replied: No, when a lot of Dukes of the Duke will feel uncomfortable. Jue, not bad. Finally, this abominable guy has made many enemies wish to be old and old, staying in the Ola, and a priest asks: Old Clough, if someone hurts you, how would you forgive him? The old man grinned: Forgive him for being God's business. The only thing I have to do is to send this group of short-eyed bastards to see God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count who had been erecting his ears laughed and laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few old guys who can feel no regrets about a life that is not short-lived? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Richmond bowed his head and took a bite of black tea, which seemed to be extraordinarily sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clough’s general butler walked into the garden and looked at the young monks after the ceremony: “Master Augustine, a pair of mothers and daughters from the province of Richelieu Express your gratitude to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count is smiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin thought for a moment and shook his head: "Please leave them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler is straight behind go away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Richmond just missed a moment and thought about the mystery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the Earl's Court, the mother and daughter who were denied access to the news still stayed for a moment, and the lady pulled up the hand of a disappointed daughter. "Let's go, Terry. Thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lady who has been wearing the magical intern costume of St. Carroll College said sadly: "Mother, that is the one that was passed down by the college." Are the priests of Master Augustine in Homer's Epic tired of us? But we didn't try to climb Kraft, just want to express the most sincere gratitude to him."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Mehna clenched her daughter's slender hand with a bruised joint, staring at her sad face and shaking her head: "No, Master Augustine is still treating her in good faith with his way." The empire does not understand him, but we can't. I finally understand why the old Don Quixote would be willing to walk alone for such a young aristocrat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two A lady from Richelieu County bowed and gently left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the garden, the old count has left, and Mrs. Richmond looks to the young man who is still playing by the godson on the neck and asks: "Augustin, I asked An embarrassing question, do you feel angry, afraid, or panic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin holding the tender hands of the teacher smiled: "Of course. For example, I am now I am afraid that Little Clough will pee on my head."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
