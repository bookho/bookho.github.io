			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin returned to the study and took a map of the northwestern part of the county of Maso County, staring at the flower dew territory adjacent to the Black Swan Lake and the Ascott Manor. The private garden of the barbarian Greenspan, the Ascott Manor is the small canary of the Todd family. On the land area, the flower dew is four times that of the Ascott Manor, but the barbarian has never opened the flower to a cash cow. In addition to the heart of the white elephant castle, there is not even a decent flowerbed or vineyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beasted by cosmo, the Ascott Manor was stationed by a Knights of 200 in the presence of a private arena. The number of Augustine’s men was only 90. The creation of the lowest level of the Cannons Knights requires nearly 30,000 Caesar gold coins. The gold coins needed to support the 200-level intermediate knights are by no means a multiplier of the number of people. It is proved that Viscount Heber’s talent in making money is second only to him. Seduce the Marceau County lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Augustine has been considering setting up an underground arena, Mrs. Fiona and Louis Butler gave a detailed slave trade channel for Viscount Heber, and Louis played The Arena also has experience. The only problem is that the gladiator source depends on the friendliness of the arena and the Bounty Hunters Association. As long as the threshold is solved, Augustine is confident that the arena will be more bloody, violent and cruel than Mississippi. It is absolutely possible to let Masojun and even the emperors of the Imperial Capital take out a lot of Caesars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial rules for regular knights and wizards can not compete? Can't fight in religious festivals? All this Mississippi needs to cover up to the Augustine side, it is easy, he can even let the young nun who is short of money and willing to make money as a maid to shuttle in the arena hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be the time to integrate into the Marceau County aristocracy." Augustine said to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera returned from Alpha City, standing behind him, while Augusting pinched his shoulder and reported the situation: "Choose 30 children, 8 intermediate knights, A senior knight. With the materials needed for the horn, a total of 42,000 Caesar coins are spent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want to return to Saxon Forest?" Augustine suddenly asked Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big heresy Andre’s daughter slowed down and did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some people have organized a huge circus for the order, which hides the members of your ‘Savior’. If you like, I can join the circus and let you leave the castle of Poetry.” Augustine whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This doesn't fit your style." Hera bitterly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For you, I always give the friendliness and measure beyond the standard, Hera Bolsefele, you can't deny this fact." Augustine laughs Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Although I chose to believe in Rothschild's family loyalty, you can't ask me to betray Saxon Forest." Hera frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The female knight who fought for more than two decades in dignity, want to know a cruel truth?" Augustine sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera is silent, because she can call this man cruel, she may not be able to bear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You think about the Saxon Forest, which has contributed an Iron Oak Medal and a dozen Yellow Sunflower War Medals to the Empire for nearly 20 years, like a piece. What kind of items?” Augustine calmly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hella is puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meat grinder." Augustine laughed. "But this is not the metaphor of the most ironed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hella's face is pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the vast expanse of soil, every inch is contaminated with jihadist knights and Saxon heresy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the flowers there are always exceptionally gorgeous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be prepared to be the largest arena of the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin punctuated the last one Layered paper, "Do you really think that the Saxon forest is tough enough to drag the imperial military machine for decades? The arrogance of heresy, the dignity, faith, and honor that you uphold is nothing but a bargaining chip for the sacred empire's military aristocracy. But, who knows who originally proposed to train Saxon into a meat grinder? It was my father and Prince Odis, and then the wise empire allowed him, because he needed a military empire that could fight the Titans of the God of War. It is not enough to gain the upper hand by relying on the production of magicians. The great Emperor Jubute wants a group of young knights who have been swayed by war, and they have a war with the Titans of the same rank. As long as the system has studied the empire every time. The number of participants in the jihad knows that every number is carefully calculated by the professors of the Imperial Knights College. Saxon has shown enough tenacity, so there is a way to send you to me. The fat man of Hell, Rhein Hatha, appeared in the Viscounti of the Condid family, appeared in Nero of Pompeii, and appeared in Constantine, one after another, the young hawks war rushed out of the water and boarded the empire stage. If there is no jihad, there is no such thing as you and your envy, a fool like Descartes, the fat man may be playing the maid in the family of Rotongschild, and he was with me at the Aurora Academy. Nero, maybe it really became a troubadour. Saxon is so hard to send fresh blood to the empire, and Judeth the Great should really give your father the highest honor of the Grand Cross. I believe that every one is The knights, warriors, and even children who grew up in Saxon Forest have their own beliefs worthy of death, but when you think of this conspiracy as a leader, can you still make a generous declaration before every battle? Saxon’s goddess, Need me to give you a little pity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera was full of tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drip on Augustin's shoulder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whimpered: "Then you let me return to Saxon, want to see a joke joke?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustin did not turn around, still staring at the map, without warm comfort, just self-deprecating: "Miss Hera, can you clown than me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The female knight slowly stopped crying and looked strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin calmly said: "Do not worry, let you go back to Saxon, there is no conspiracy, but I feel that you are bound to the prison of poetry brother, maybe In 20 years, you are just a big knight. When you choose loyalty Luo Tongchaid instead of me personally, I have this idea. Your battlefield should not be a gloomy cosmo, but a jihad. Under the banner. You are not a noble-born Quentin-Florence, she may also be able to play the role of a poetry diplomat, and with the Marceau County aristocrats, you are not the same as Shi Yi and Shirley. Only led the 100-man Dagger The wasteful knight is destined to become a goddess of knights."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera firmly said: "Whether it is your conspiracy, I will thank you today. Decided."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince of Rotong Childe’s fat man turned her into a plaything for the Empire’s aristocratic auction, and finally she was placed by the owner of Luo Tong’s Back to Saxon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does and the goddess of fortune slapped each other? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera left the study and did not try to think about the answer, she always believed in intuition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Elizabeth stood at the door, sinisterly smiled: "Augustin, you stock the lamb, is this the first few?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing sheep? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a terminology that only Augustine and she understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin used a pen to draw a circle on the white elephant castle on the map, and shifted the topic: "Tomorrow Gaolu Manor has a noble dinner, are you interested in participating?" ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
