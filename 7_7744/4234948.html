			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Two chapters of 7 thousand words have been updated.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assassin Quentin and double professional master Hera added a seemingly easy task every day, accompanied Augustine in actual combat training. In the spacious martial arts hall, Augustine picked one, and Miss Elizabeth had already made a secret transaction with Hera, who she called the big vase. Then he gave the gold-necked dagger in the clockwork orange to the imported bag to Mrs. Quentin. Augustine was very curious about this, but the three women remained silent. The martial arts hall, full of Augustine's squandering smashing magic, with a lot of unreasonable knights and sinister assassin flicker, according to the pure theoretical strength of the superposition, with the skilled Hera and Mrs. Quentin should occupy a small advantage to meet Common sense, but in fact it is the woman of two devils who have been attacked by Augustine with magic or body. Fortunately, the search operation of Lancôme Castle brought many ladies' costumes that were originally regarded as rubbish by Augustine, otherwise it will soon They will fall into the sorrowful situation of undressed, Augustine in the battle to vent his nuclear blast that has just exploded, like a wild beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the venting of the martial arts hall, he will go to Hall’s class and listen quietly to the girls who regard him as a god. Now the little Hall has Promoted to the assistant teacher of the Yangjiao Rose Lab, as an assistant to the silent assistant Professor Kim, as the confidant of the big executives, the two horns are both paranoid and eccentric characters, and soon after getting along for a while In order to cultivate a good understanding, Xiao Hall is like a machine full of heresy. With the excellent execution of Kim's teaching assistant, the small-scale experimental results of Rose make the purple lily and the rose laboratory secretly scared. There was an episode during the period, and Professor Shirley’s unfortunately ruined egg had the courage to find Augustine and gave the consul a sin. Small information, he was put back afterwards, but no longer followed the Shirley professor who lost in the first competition, but the Viola Lab, which is relatively more powerful and more life-saving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The big ruling officer, can I ask you a question?" After class, the girl who dared to take the initiative to approach Augustine only had a superior Agatha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You said." Augustine stopped and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Mobius ring you said yesterday, I think I found the answer." Agatha took out a note, twisted 180 degrees, then Linked together, so that an ant is placed on the strip, and it will go back to the origin, which proves that the two worlds that should have been cut seem to be screwed into a plane. At that time, Augustine was tested by the godfather, and Augustine gave the answer almost the first time, just like Agatha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sure enough, it's a smart girl." Augustine reached out and touched the girl's head and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, there is a note in the hand, and she is always timid. She looks at her companion with a big smile and her body trembles. Agatha passed her by, smiling and full of provocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fascinating look. Today, their drawing tasks on the ground of Shi’s brother have been successfully completed. After the lecture, they can go to the simple library to read, but she is only A newly-slaved slave can't browse the magic books at all, even if they are based on the basics, only Agatha, who is always the most active in the class, can read them. She can only try hard to remember in the classroom. Every word of Hall, every word, crazy excerpt, can't take care of what the tough characters symbolize, metaphor, but even then, her performance is still the bottom of the classroom, she Biting her lip, she came to the hollow circular corridor not far from where she lived, where she could sit on the ground and look up at the meditation of St. Urban, at which time she could get a peace that she had never experienced before. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Zhen, why don't you sleep?" It happened that after the hollow round Hera saw her child looking up at St. Urban, and went over and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Hera." Jane panicked, clenching the little note and a pearl, and placed a densely folded notebook on her knee. It is too reluctant to let a child who is not well written by his name when he walks out of Lolita suddenly learns esoteric magic and arcane theory. Hera sat next to her, picked up the excerpt that she couldn’t hide, flipped it over, and gave it to the fearless treasure, the big knight looked up and looked at it. Respecting is not an angel or a devil's St. Urban, softly said: "When I was a child, I only wanted to be a knight, I could knock down the imperial dragon knight's knight, and one day my father said that I would like to learn from Austria. I don’t want to, because I don’t understand, I don’t understand. The strict father will take me to the battlefield. It’s the first time I set foot on the battlefield with the empire. The imperial knight is like the harvest of wheat with the help of a large number of wizards. Killing my people, the magic is like a fireworks, blooming over the Saxon forest, very cruel, but also very beautiful, isn't it, Jane?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic, Knight Sword, for any slave who is born into a barren, is a sacred thing beyond the gold coins and freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world where there is only a handgun and dignity, the lingering dignity of the dignity, Jane has never heard of it, but some diseaseless bards like to take some fictional stories to blind the ignorant lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My father said that a person's life should be like this. When the day is over, ask yourself before going to bed. If I have the chance to go back to the morning, am I willing? If the answer is yes, it means that your day is full of regrets and regrets. If it is not, this is a fulfilling day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera Unlike Mrs. Quentin, who is from the nobility herself, she likes to cherish more, not the smart Agatha who has passed the head. When she mentioned her father, Hera couldn't help but think of the years when she was wearing a knight in the Saxon Forest. Every day, like her father said, she would not want to experience it again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Hera, your father must be a good father." Jane whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great heresy Andrei should have heard tears in this sentence." A tuning voice sounded not far away, and Jane’s reflexive standing stood up. Restless, Hera slowly got up and had a anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue to sit down." Augustine laughed. Seeing that both of them were not moving, they took the lead and Hera hesitated and looked at her eyes. Jane, take the girl and sit down together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Zhen, you are wrong, Miss Hera’s father may be a qualified heresy, but not a qualified father." Augustine laughed. I looked at my eyes and handed a hand-written theological masterpiece "Ben Eugen's heresy" from the Lancome College of Lancome to the girl. "When you come, don't sit on the ground for too long, Use this pad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera is wrong, Jane's face is red, of course, there is no guts to pick up the book of the consul, not to mention the little ass Sitting on the "Oswego" heresy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the order." Augustine threw the book to her, no extra nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl's hands instinct to pick up the book, the result of the paper and pearls fell to the ground, Augustine picked up, frowned, and then relieved, "Ms. Hera I don't understand why there is only one pearl necklace left, I know. Jane, you think that what you do now is right, waiting for you to master strength, well, just like you are a great arcane master like Miss Hera. What do you do?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
