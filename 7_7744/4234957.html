			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s very strange, perhaps because of the unique stubbornness of a good woman, Mrs. Quentin’s biggest and only admiration for Augustine, not this young man’s summoned to a full-time trial” The arrogant god, St. Urban, is a small insistence that he couldn’t tell the truth about a broken old carriage. For example, at 4 am before arriving at the underground castle of Black Swan Lake, he began to do every day. The prayers are generally the same as those of the monks. This kind of persistence, the outsiders are doomed to be invisible, and even if they see them, they may not be able to win a substantial reputation for the young dark giants. Mrs. Quentin can only understand the gods of Ola. Only after this time, the school realized that Augustine was still the godson of Saint Iyeta, and it was one of the two official interpreters of the teachings alongside the entire Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prayer is finished, the sky is still dark, the dawn is far from coming, Queen Loli is curled up in the corner of the carriage, and Augustine re-covers the blanket that falls on the little girl, her eyes Warm, Mrs. Quentin can be regarded as the most "close" role of the poetry brother's underground castle. He observed a lot of his eyes at a close distance, looking up to the deepness of St. Urban in the sleeping, when he used the goose to flow beautiful words in the study. Self-confidence, the indifference in the inspection of the project in the Yangjiao laboratory, the deceitful and calm when dealing with Archbishop Ram, but when he looks to the Muse Shaman, he will always be serene, even if he has usurped the body and soul of the gorse When the little shaman bites him, Mrs. Quentin sitting in the corner sighs softly and has a complicated mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin gently looked down at the consul of a theological book, and couldn’t help thinking about the trend of the cosmo in her mind, she handed over the Meso County At the moment of the secret insider information, on the way she led Augustine to the Mississippi Arena, she was tied to the dark, crazy carriage after she was ordered to cut the head of the sergeant Heber. Compared with the three major institutions of the heresy ruling, cosmo began to feel like a baby in the storm, until St. Urban arrived, and the black magic swan's super magical array "God's left eye" is about to be completed, only the last Gemini and Aquarius, she first contacted an epic magical array of this size, I don’t know how much energy it contains, but I believe it is destined to be above the Scarlett soul elegy, privately known as the Knight of the Knights of the Knights. Even if the combat power is not worth mentioning in her eyes, its growth is obviously negligible. It is just a group of laborers who are slightly more useful than the inferior slaves. The deputy head of the Philippine team is showing a poor performance. Force value, but Mrs. Quentin find practical and shrewd Augustine does not expect this name just advanced to five knights advanced cannon fodder to play an important strategic significance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that has value is the "shofar", the chief research officer, Miss Yu Yi's Sayuri Research Lab, the paranoid mad Kim's assistant's Rose Lab, and the irritated Rose Lab under the sensation of Professor Shirley. The broken ram of the ewes, under the pressure of the obsolete end of the elimination system, broke out with amazing impact. Except for the high-ranking skeleton knights who have been put into actual combat, they have gradually produced 9 mature skeletons close to 10, perhaps the ratio Not the first three scorpions created by the bodies of precious knights, but it is said that the latter is more perfect in the most important soul filling, and Mrs. Quentin has only one thought of the poetry brother who has an unknown undead army. A sense of ridiculousness, when the outside hostile, seeing the undead army to drill the ground, what a shocking scene? Moreover, this team is not only the skeleton knight, but also the new species "big witch", this is simply the version of the Knights + Master of the Necromancer, the most common ten classic combination, is also the most golden combination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years of the Pope's Hall, Mrs. Quentin also played the role of a researcher, knowing that in addition to the biggest enemy "magic", theology also has a The well-known opponent, "science," cosmo is more similar to the Pope's Hall at this point. As for the maiden girl wizard group, Mrs. Quentin is not optimistic for the time being, but Augustine revealed that the team of mages should be expanded to 300 people. The specific understanding is to fill the entire fourth floor underground castle. He said that he is willing to spend 10 years. Perfecting this task, so the son-in-law of Luo Tong's son-in-law from the Greek Hera-Borse Fowler has recently been called to the Lolita slave market, picking out the children she thinks worth investing, Augustine mentioned, He There was a mysterious intuition that could not be explained, which made Mrs. Quentin admit that she was indeed awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin couldn’t help but glance at the little guy sleeping next to Augustine, the female shaman who also shrouded in the unknown shadow, watching Mrs. Quentin It is the poetry brother underground castle second only to the powerful existence of St. Urban, not right, simple and powerful is not enough to describe her, it is a metamorphosis, whether it is the Holy Empire or the Gorse dynasty, who can support two gold ya Kind as a small pet? The most damn thing is that these two "small" pets are now up to 15 meters long, mature 8th order, the next step is to rival the dragon. I heard that Augustine is a neuropathy that repairs nine major occupations, and Augustine confessed that he was only chasing his personal butler. Mrs. Quentin looked at the little loli that was sleeping peacefully, beautiful, delicate as the most perfect doll, innocent. Behind the mask hides the devil's mind and strength. Mrs. Quentin suddenly felt a little discouraged because she realized that even if she was a 13th-level Irish undead warlock and a 9th-level assassin, the closest to the governor of the Knights of the Suns, perhaps forever true is more than anyone else. Big big loli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is there anyone who praised you when you think about the problem?” Augustine, who read the book through the faint night, looked up and smiled. When he thought about it, he treated the sister who knew this incense store, except for the oily spanking. And the unrequited heads-up, even a sincere praise has never been. As for the aristocratic accolades that they had endlessly launched during the epic war, the credibility was too low to count. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, Mrs. Quentin seems to be blushing and licking her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you tell me what you were thinking about?" Augustine whispered, closed the book, chatted with the lady and the lady, kept their eyes focused, serious Gesture, this is the good education of the Luo Tong Chaid family for hundreds of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When can the order persist?" Mrs. Quentin whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the very least, the day when the three giants came to the Black Swan Lake personally." Augustine gave the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that at St. John's Cathedral, the dark giant of the 'Ewe' is the only big man who shows you good feelings," Mrs. Quentin said softly. "The mother of the ewe," Hai Ji, who is a woman who is fearful in the Pope's Hall, such as the female rattlesnake who expressed her deformity and dark "sexual interest", proudly conceited as the disciple of St. Givenchy, also admitted to Vatican The most powerful old woman in Tigang, Hai Ji, is a woman she can't surpass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good feeling?" Augustine smiled and shook his head. "The sacred spears of the Big Three are dismissive to me. The priests of the Teutonics are because I was a member of the night watch." The attitude is rather awkward, and it is not awkward or close. Only Haiji is the clear enemy who wants to refine me into a sly. In fact, one day before the St. John's Cathedral, the ewe launched a wave to me. A strong assassination, her guy in the plane is unreasonable. What's more, your brain's intelligence has always been inversely proportional to the weight of your chest, and should be even more incomprehensible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin got used to his ridicule, indifferent, superficial, and her inner feelings were unknown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wondered: "Why is she willing to give you the horns?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin With a mocking taste: "It’s just a boring little game for Hai Ji adults. Just like placing a little smashing metal or dirty elements in a Paladin, you need the Cavaliers to dig them out, Mrs. Quentin, you won’t Innocent to think that the horn is a group of research mad with a high loyalty index?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Quentin snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin mocked Mrs. Quentin and immediately ridiculed: "The traitor hidden in the depths of the horn may be the researcher who has been standing opposite the haiji adults. Perhaps it was the former Black Sheep confidant Shirley, or the Kim Assistant who was promoted by me. It also has the opportunity to hide some of the characters. Maybe one day, he or they will be behind the scenes. Knife, how, this game of looking for a silent lamb is not very interesting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin shook her head and said nothing. The aristocratic game has always been hated by her, which is one reason why she chose to enter the Pope Hall Science and Technology Institute instead of marrying the same aristocratic man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin regained the theological book, and Mrs. Quentin was very interested in not interrupting his reading progress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After dawn, the carriage entered the Black Swan Lake, and Augustin deliberately got off and checked the magic circle that was about to be completed. The poor fellow Knights were almost spurred around the clock. Construction labor, fortunately, every day has the opportunity to contact a group of young and beautiful girls, this may be the biggest welfare, this time the original in the supervision of Hera is not present, because the Alta City Lolita slave market to pick slaves The child fills the mage team, Augustine said that he did not ruin the bad habit of Caesar gold coins in the underground castle storage room. In addition to spending a small amount of money to screen the future mages, Hera spent more on a dark project to serve as a shofar purchase. Intermediate knights of experimental materials, even in Lolita, the largest slave market in the middle of the Empire, the top grade knights are rare. Fortunately, the owner of the clockwork orange, Count Marse, showed enough respect to cosmo. Hera's good privilege, Hera will wear a tight cloak every time she goes to Alpha City to "shop", and then bring a lily or a big witch. After all, her identity sensitive, it is difficult to ensure that no large family would be "female Zeus" identity tempted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agatha is still the girl who once sees Augustine dare to take the initiative to say hello, she is the leader of the girl wizard group, arrogant and out of the Juliet has been unable to She competes for leadership, and as for the introverted and unremarkable Jane, she is even less able to compare with the mature Agatha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The handsome and kind-hearted sergeant, can I call you this?" Agatha smiled brightly, standing in front of Augustine, not at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
