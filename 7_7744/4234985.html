If you are afraid of breaking, you can look at it.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apostle's Spades A White Rose Dynasty has always been as lucky as the biological son of God. The Byzantine Holy See is at its heart, even if this dynasty has been sluggish for nearly a hundred years, the nobility The class is generally addicted to the competition of luxury, the Cavaliers wither, the magician is not valued, even a large number of local theologians have left their homeland, invited to other kingdoms, holding a salary several times higher than the original seminary, up to the letter Lieutenant sent some homesickness. But even if the discerning eye saw that the dynasty rushed down the slope with a tumultuous gesture, it still had the most powerful overall strength on the surface. Its army is still the largest, and its military chief and members of the parliament are still mainland. The richest group on the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a barren country that has been forgotten by the gods, silently and alone against the savage impact of the wild continent year after year, the northernmost part of the northernmost land There is a bell fortress that any great bard must go to in his life. It has been full of sorrow since the first day of construction. The most majestic and tragic building of the fortress is a master of 90 meters. The city wall, the wall that was named as the sorrower, blocked countless alien shocks. Similarly, there were countless bones lying there, so that it was finally impossible to distinguish the knight who died for humanity. Or the orc's dirty and broken limbs were broken. In the first hundred years, the epic continent was willing to spare no effort to sing the magical fearlessness and fierce dedication. But in just two hundred years, the praise was small, and today it is even more There is no deposit, all the aristocrats of the kingdoms of the kingdom are only willing to ridicule the unlucky luck, and the ridicule of the knights without the knights, there are only some lonely poets who are not in the main pop, seeing the crowds all the year round. Tens of thousands of densely savage orcs, who heard the night whistling of the cold wind or the cry of the dead soul, will make some faint sounds, but like throwing a negligible pebbles on the broad lake, there is no Who will pay attention to this? The two dynasties, the white rose and the gorse, some young poets are taught by the predecessors who are very popular in the court. If you want to write popular literary works, you must not show any in the works. The thing about the card is that it is just a backward kingdom that even the tail of the civilization has not caught. It is as barbaric as the aliens of the wild continent. The knight there is sitting on the horseback and will be carrying a giant axe. Is this like a word? If you lack food, you will kill the warhorse. If you are thirsty, you will drink the blood of the Orcs. Is this still a knight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the young empress taking the crown from the bloody head of her biological father, she put it on her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "invincible Dr. Theology" Saxon became the heresy sword in the hands of the Queen of Wonders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The epic continent is increasingly fiercely prejudiced against this country, even extreme hatred. At the beginning of this year, the specification was only slightly lower than the round table meeting, the Queen of the Queen was absent, and the Jupiter the Great of the Holy Empire did not participate as always. The old Titans were busy planning new wars and no appearances, several central and northwestern The king clamored to unite to block all aspects of the card, but the weak white emperor looked pale and shrunk in the chair, shivering, not daring, and in the middle of the talk, the first of the Titan and the card Together, the spearheads point to the Holy Empire, and everyone immediately closes their mouths. And the lady who took the throne for a few years and personally rode on the land of several Principalities in the war immediately, gently said "I will remember you" into the ears of others, so that I have not confirmed whether this sentence is true. The kings from the Queen’s mouth immediately handed a large amount of gold coins and the most scarce war supplies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged emperor of the gorse privately laughed and asked one of the kings of the same ancient family: "Old Bate, your land is separated from the card. What are you worried about with the gorse and more than a dozen principals, city-states and free trade zones?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The king who ransacked at the meeting regretted his annoyance and asked "If the female madman really killed thousands of knights to my kingdom, which ally would you like to block for me? Even if they really stand firm to let me choke, but who can block the number is really insignificant卡妙铁骑?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gorse emperor is speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is grand and ethereal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But every soldier under the wheel of war is microscopic and fresh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially when you are on the main wall of a huge bell fortress, you will most intuitively feel the smallness of human beings. The main city wall has not been named in the empire, and the Kameng official does not recognize the "sorrower" who was first spread by the bard. This stubborn country of loneliness refused even the poor goodwill. At this moment, the walls are full of soldiers, and the granite plaza on the inner side of the wall is a place where the empire will not be frosted, because this square stands with horseshoes and warriors' feet all the year round. The heirs must come to this land that is only one city gate away from the battlefield, and must be rushed out with the Knights at the necessary time. If they want to continue to enjoy the treatment of the nobility, they must personally win the enemy for the family. The honor of warm blood, this is a rule that any epic mainland country will be laughed at by the nobility. After the woman is in charge of the empire, it is more rigorous and demanding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kami never deliberately exaggerates the greatness of a single hero. Even if they are qualified to be carved into a god of war, they stand in the square, and none of them have the privilege of being commemorated in history. This country, which seems to be inexplicable and incomprehensible to the outside world, is not a celebration dinner, not a ceremony of honor, or even an emperor’s enthronement, but a funeral at the end of the campaign. The burial team is not inferior, not infertile. Standing in the snow without any cover, except that the emperor has the right to wear the crown, even the Archbishop of Red is not allowed to wear the red cross pattern of the golden robe. The emperor’s privilege disappeared after the new Queen’s succession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Palace is originally adjacent to the Arctic Bell Cathedral in the southernmost part of the Empire, but the first thing she did was to move the New Palace into the Bell Fortress. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then she once again did not follow the common sense to promote universal education, from the few imperial finances, a large amount of tax was deducted to pay free The enrollment fee for all children is arrogant in the eyes of an epic Continental historical observer. "The empire stood at the top of the mainland a hundred years later, and it was decided as early as today's desk." The deceased finance minister did not dare to say anything. . Immediately afterwards, she personally led a two-kilometer iron ride to level a medium-sized duchy known as a regular knight with a total number of 20,000. The reason is simple. The nobles of the Principality have raised a large number of unscrupulous businessmen and bounty hunters. The young girl of the empire, the Queen personally cut his head in the palace, the headless body was exposed, it seems that she can not remember this is the first few, self-deprecating will always help her count. Not long after, the fleet funded by her and the Holy Empire discovered the New World almost at the same time. She personally named the British Isles chain. In order to compete for the entire ownership of the New World in her view, it was unabashedly arranged in the southern part of the empire. An elite army, did not let the skeptical mad king not echo with the son of the war, and took the initiative to provoke war against the Holy Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All, let this woman who likes to play the dragon tooth Amier shield alone has an unparalleled reputation. The nobility fears her bloody wrists, and the civilians are grateful for her gift of return. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these years, she has walked almost all corners of the Empire. She will walk through the cold and icy ice sheet with the Cavaliers, and even walk a few times. I will walk into the classroom to teach the children, tell the history of the empire, and tell them that the bow on the desk can be used to win the pride of the future. She will step into the slums, eat the roughest food with the old man, and drink the cheapest and strongest Soviet shochu. Moreover, she not only has a shocking iron fist, so that the epic continent no longer dares to sell the card population, she also brought a huge surplus trade to the empire, as well as a few spoils that were clean and neat after the ridiculous war, and those defeated countries Far more powerful than the Cavaliers, the gorgeous armor did not flow into the aristocratic sac, but was distributed under her strict supervision to the warriors who killed the most in the empire, even if they did not have a noble title, even if many of them were too old to be Once again, I rushed to the battlefield of the gongs and drums. In the past few years, many old people have been dressed in beautiful armor that has not passed through for a lifetime, and the younger generations don’t bring the armor into the grave, but peel it off, put it on, and continue. Fight for the empire and raise the weapon for the queen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the main wall of the fortress, in the center, stood a young woman wearing a common armor, holding a helmet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black hair flutters in the wind, covering most of the cool and gorgeous face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, she is the king of the card in the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversation she had with a heresy who was deeply impressed in a study in the empire was widely spread on the epic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dr., do you want me to give you a robe of the Archbishop of Red, or a new Holy See? This Arctic Bell Cathedral is in you After you arrive at the card, it is yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want the faith of the whole card empire. If you protect me with swords and irons, I will Protect yourself with a pen!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young woman did not hesitate to agree to the madness of the black emperor Saxon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she changed the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said: For me, the quill in the hands of Saxon is sharper than the spears of all the sacred knights of the Titans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognized to be invincible, from birth, it showed a strangely indifferent black emperor, who did not yield to Pope Bixley IV and the Byzantine Inquisition The old man who bows his head will only respect the young woman who can be his granddaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the snow, she stood on the wall, standing beside the red archbishop Phoenician who had lived for more than 130 years, the old man was responsible for The Queen's voice is extended by special magic to the point where every soldier in the room can hear it. It is not that the empire is hostile to the gentle style, but the northernmost land is destined to be unable to speak with the temper and the ground, especially on the battlefield, everyone needs to do their best to scream and shout. It’s not a knight who likes to travel long distances, but the empire needs them to brave the cold to guard their homes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally slowly opened her mouth with a strong disdain: "The knights on the epic continent believe in knightly dogmas, including honor, fraternity, and compassion. I ask you, Kay, the people, are you fighting for these things? Are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sound spreads out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scream that pierces the eardrum and breaks through the clouds: "No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resounding the ice sheet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow is drizzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black pressure outside the fortress is a foreign army that seems to feel the anger of the wonderful soldiers and start to be restless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is pointing to the wild continent, "There are our enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then turned to the south "Where, our enemies!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every family and family have ancestors who died in the battle of the wonderful soldiers: "Enemy! Enemy! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Card Wonder Queen Mori shouted: "We only fight for survival! Empire, never give in!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every young or vicissitudes of the face exudes the tragic history of heavy history, and the enthusiasm brought by this great woman, they shouted the same sentence: "Never give in!" <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Ka Miao Tie rides the wild people under the city of 40,000 soldiers in the wild, roaring iron shovel straight into the three hundred miles, and killing 20,000 orcs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sensation of the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred emperor, who is used to silence and squinting, expresses his sincere respect for his country for the first time, and actively asks to share the new gospel with the card or the rule of the British island chain. The right, after a time-consuming negotiation, signed a public agreement, demarcation between the North and the South, and signed the offensive and defensive alliance of the two empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Maya Mountains, which are far away from Kamo and the Holy Empire, have no good news, and four carefully selected temple candidates have turned out to be Only one person who successfully reached the foothills of the Michelle, half-dead to enter the temple, and even had no time to appreciate the shocking scenes of the three magical gods, was carried in. The one who was originally optimistic about a gorse magician was lucky enough to make people sigh and sigh. He crossed the summit of the Michelle several times and wandered around the Mayan temple for a whole week. This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity had to return to the dynasty, and a young magician from the Austro-Hungarian Federation almost died of an avalanche, was rescued by the temple, sent out the mountains, and the last young and amazing female magician It was completely disappeared under the eyes of the Mayan temple. Except for the dragon vein, the temple almost searched half of the Mayan mountains. There is still no result. It can only be abandoned. There will be regrets about this Mayan temple, but it will never I am worried about the Holy Empire. But the helplessness is that the only candidate who arrived at the temple lost his normal mind after being sent to the lower dragon's point at the bottom of a dragon's pulse. It seems that this year, the Mayan temple is another year without surprise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white robe magician without a staff member stood under the statue of three gods outside the temple and sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gods are towering into the sky, with a standard of the world, nearly 100 meters high, all the alternate magicians who are qualified to reach the top of the Michelle first sight These statues will all be different how they are built. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white-haired white magician looks into the distance, he has spent the years of forgetting the years in the Mayan temple, the epic world’s honor and disgrace rises and falls, he never goes to ask Here, no one will be proud of the original badge and glory, only humble to explore the truth. The old man has forgotten all the previous titles. From becoming an internship magic apprentice, he will only remember one person's teaching for life and be a god. When he saw the man who had not had the chance to see this life five years ago, he was ecstatic, and the nearly 100-year-old man was happy like a child. The teachings of that person allowed the old people to choose the holy empire. The young girl became the candidate for the last place, for which he bet his own badge of the god crow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man stood in the snow in the mountains and sentimentally said: "Teacher, you said she is a hopeful one to pick up the latest crow badge and possibly take it The person who walks the Nibelon-root heart is called the child of genius, and it must be the magical darling that is closest to the realm of the demigod in the future. Gold does not care about his god crow badge, only the child once I can't enter the temple, I really can't listen to your teachings anymore. Even the youngest Tehsa is gone, I'm afraid I can't hold on for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old man’s ear came a long burst of the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so clear that it is absolutely impossible for a dragon to be signed by the dragon and the dragon to sign the dragon's law and to be imprisoned by the dragon. The Moses are the gods of the Mayan gods thousands of years ago. The three founders of the temple, the Golden Island and the altar of the Sun God signed the supreme commandments with the dragons, stipulating that the dragons could coexist with humans, but could not leave the four dragons. The birth of the spells was the first human being to fight against the mainland. The dragon, the danger of this near-god, allows the suffering human beings to understand that the rifle and the sword cannot be defeated, which forces the human to delve into the deeper meaning of the body, so the magician and the arcian to the knight and the sword The congenital contempt of the scholars is not unfounded. Maya’s final test of the candidates is to send them to the Dragon Cave and face-to-face communication with the dragon. If this thought and body develop to the ultimate perfect race, they will be able to nod. Becoming a practitioner of the Mayan temple, of course, these dragon caves only have low-ranking dragons. The dragon-slayers in the poems of human heroes are mostly killed by these dragons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it an angry, superior dragon that can’t stand it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to the sound, that is an adult sacred ice dragon "Calape" marked as the third place on the dragon spectrum, the so-called "human Gulalan" The eloquent history is the crown that the gods once belonged to in the dusk era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dragon has always been known for its docileness. Why is this so unusual this time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the hatred and degeneration of the companion Black Dragon Dandong one hundred and twenty years ago? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue of the gods gathered a large number of Mayan monks who walked out of the temple. Most of them frowned, and many sages went to the square for the first time in ten years and decades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a majestic sound at the top of the temple: "Remove the guardian of the magical king of immortality. We are about to usher in the latest partner, she is a Mayan history The first young child who entered the temple with such a gesture."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mythical dragon Carragher glides from a distant wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s head, standing with a young woman holding a book, her face calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing on the top of the dragon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the difference between standing on the top of the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This child, or human? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wears a strange worn badge that is not familiar to the temple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The huge body of the dragon slammed into the ground, occupying more than half of the square, raising the wind and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman gently jumped off the dragon's head, light and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sacred Carape told a string of ice dragons that are unique to the ice dragon. It seems to be saying goodbye to a young but young woman. She nodded slightly and waved her hand. The dragon went away, and it was a blizzard of wind and snow. It circled several times in the foothills of the Michelle, and it returned to the dragon vein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
