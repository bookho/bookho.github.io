His current position is slightly higher than Miss Greenispan’s Miss Alice. The pale face is not sick in the light bath, but there is a human being. Saints breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hella, who chooses family loyalty, closes her eyes and feels the supply of faith, as if she is in the hot springs, warm and full. She found herself stepping into the threshold of the big knight. She finally knew why Augustine suggested that she minored in love. If she had listened to this suggestion, she couldn't even imagine how advanced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa stood on the ladder and looked up at the young Augustin, the second time after Lolita’s legal orange auction, the old man witnessed the gathering of many great people. The Greenspan White Elephant Castle planned the war prologue of the Poetry Castle. He was also responsible for bringing the white ivory chess piece to help Miss Alice to the table, witnessing the shock brought by Scarlett's soul elegy. It was originally weather-beaten with the "barbarians". The old man thought that it was the most outstanding performance of a young man. At this moment, the old man who is similar to the old temperament of Luo Tong Chaid’s steward is no longer to face up to the ancient Latin “Libra” St. Urban, which is not The majestic existence that he can observe for a long time, the old man turned his head and looked at Miss Alice, who was full of pure light in his eyes. He also gave birth to a daughter who was proud of the imperial empire, but only the little master saw the Empire No. 2 at a glance. The sons of the traitors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice asserts herself to the order. Greenspan is also the first olive branch of the entire aristocratic world, but will harvest a dark scepter! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa smiles and smiles, gently step back a few steps, no longer blocking the sight of Miss and Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is looking down at the horns lab on the ground, coldly saying: "I am now publishing the first rule of order, once a month, scores The people at the end will be eliminated. You can go back to work, I hope that you will eventually be able to accomplish the goals I expected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new "giant" in the three horns Under the leadership of the Yi Yi Research Officer, Professor Shirley and Kim’s assistant professor, the Horns Lab is almost running back to the laboratory to carry out their own projects. This will be a crazy competition with a Dharmus sword hanging over the head. It is very likely to pay the price of being the test body in the hands of the other two parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heretical wizard Hall is soaring in the status of cosmo, and it is the red man of the great consul. In addition to imparting basic lessons to the girl in the reserve team, he is the lucky one of the few horns who have the power to walk out of the underground castle of the poet, and the rest, It’s been a long time since he hadn’t enjoyed the sun. He was as timid and humbled on the ground after the coming of the Holy Fall. When Augustine opened his mouth, he returned to the classroom with the group of girls who had already regarded the order leader as the god, and the group was shocked. Losing the sensible child, Hall calms down the chaotic thoughts in his mind and solemnly says: "Today's miracles will accompany us all for a lifetime. You can imprint in the soul, remember in your mind, but you can't say your mouth, that will It is the biggest mistake and awkwardness that human beings can make. Although we are already in the fourth largest organization of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Holy See, this does not mean that we can be devout to the gods, and the Lord Archon will let you witness this. Holy fall is not his arrangement, it is the arrangement of the Lord, the Lord is against you, and it is a test of my soul. We can betray cosmo one day for faith. In order to betray the governor for great benefit, or even to betray the empire, but must not betray this baptism."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls nodded hard and the tears on the tender face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Urban, who has been closed forever, slowly puts up the holy wings and dark bat wings, wraps up the body and almost occupies the entire concentric circle. Standing on the ground of the earth, after being forcibly summoned from the hell of a certain abyss, it does not seem to adapt to the new field of the poetry castle, and fell into the deepest meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, who died in his life, jumped from the head of St. Urban, and finally he was able to take a bold breath and look calmly at the lady from the barbarian family, smiling: " Can I take you to visit Black Swan Lake?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice nodded happily and performed aristocratic rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin and Hera passed by, took a look at her hips, whispered: "Go to the Knights stare, who made Abnormal behavior, drag directly into the Yangjiao Lab, don't worry about misjudgment, although cosmo is temporarily poor, but the normal loss of one or two low-ranking knights is completely within the acceptable range."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera blushing, she finally recovered from the huge shocking aftertaste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two uninvited guests of Greenspan and Augustine walked out of the ground and returned to Hera, the peak of the Saxon forest period, to the Knights’ station, so that her current knight can Control a cannon ash knight. In the voluminous official document of the glorious deeds of the paladin, there was a rare record of a sacred knight who slaughtered a 600-strong elite knight, but the sacred knight also paid the price of life, which almost became The official verdict of the sole vertex of a St. Knight's strength, the Grand Cavaliers' first trial level is 10, the central knight is 16, and the holy knight is unattainable. 20, the magician and the knight who is the "hand of God" The ancient dispute has lasted for nearly a thousand years. It turns out that within the same 10 levels, the two sides do not rely on the equipment above the sigh level, the knight will have an absolute advantage, but between 10 and 20, the magician has changed the trend and has the pole. High win rate, and the "jihad" of the top knights and magicians after the 20th level, full of unknown variables, no saint knight claimed to be invincible, and no great magician who can walk out of the Mayan temple dare to publicly threaten High-level knights are just the shackles of high-level magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Asa walked out of the Poetry Castle, he no longer followed Miss Alice and Master Augustine. He did not think that under the eyes of White Elephant Castle, who had the guts to be uncomfortable with Greenspan’s flower, and the young sacrament also Showing the strength beyond the understanding too much, the old housekeeper will not bother with the warmth of a pair of couples. Which old man is not coming from the youth step by step? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice walked down to the Black Swan Lake and Augustine stood beside her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I, Alice Greenspan, today is not visiting the poetry brothers castle as a female heir to Greenspan, just want to see Quentin Auntie introduced me to the magician, wondering if he is interested in spending a day in the white elephant castle not far away, explaining some magical knowledge to a woman who is not smart." Alice smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Alice, take the liberty to say something, your eyes are much better than your family." Augustine also sat down after hearing Alice's explanation. He took the grass and chewed it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think so too, the woman’s intuition is certainly more correct than the barbarians’ simple minds.” Miss Alice, who was a bit embarrassed, listened. After Augustin’s straightforward speech, she was relieved and her mood became more and more cheerful. When she met her for the first time when she met, Alice’s mouth couldn’t help but hang on her heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I heard Miss Alice’s words, I’m afraid that Barbarian Greenspan would be angry with the table and drop the porcelain bottle.” Augustine did not expect this first impression. Very reserved women are so hearty. In aristocratic worlds where comedy has a clown but is never naive, elegant self-deprecation often requires capital thickness and depth of thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you see that we both have a common language, this is a very good start." Miss Alice rubbed her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nice little face, a beautiful opal necklace, and a good white chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the biggest look of Augustine after a casual look at Alice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is also a pair of blue eyes that are more embarrassing than the opal, sparkling with the brilliance of wisdom, this kind of light, especially for the clever woman who is well-educated Let Augustine miss the two women who had the greatest influence on him in childhood, mother and teacher Artemis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine fell to the grass, narrowing his eyes and looking at the sky that had already passed through the dark clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lord, you should continue to sink deep after summoning the god, let me always worship and worship you." Miss Alice chuckles Tao, turning his head and staring at it is not like the young noble Augustine, he is the godson of the saints, the master of the eastern empire of the empire, and now it is the big man behind the three giants in the Ministry of the Holy See. Lying on the grass without any majesty and shelf, biting a grass, no different from the mediocre young aristocratic youth. But such a Augustine is extraordinarily full of flesh and blood, no longer the illusory man standing on the gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm afraid I will scare you away." Augustine smiled and enjoyed the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you afraid?" Miss Alice asked softly, full of expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are the first guest of Black Swan Lake, of course I will be afraid." Augustine whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice sighs softly, giving the younger peers a natural aristocratic rhetoric, both gratified and lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am even more afraid that Miss Alice sees me as a flood beast in the eyes of the emperor, I believe those rumors, what Augustine Master can walk, then Ody Prince's daughter gave the spoil, what Augustine priest was the chief culprit to kill the godfather Iyta, what the Count of Augustine was tossing from Tameilang City every night at the Monastery of Odea, and it was not willing afterwards. Spend a copper plate.” Augustine opened his eyes and smiled and stared at the young woman who looked at him. She was different from Hera Bolsefele. The daughter of Zeus was occasionally shy after Augustine’s play, and after a moment of relaxation It is also a dignified look and a heavy state of mind. Alice is not the same. She is a beautiful flower in a greenhouse. Even if she looks at the flood outside, she will not be able to destroy her. As long as the barbarian does not fall, she can be happy. Living safely, such a female role is rare in Augustine’s life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't believe in the malicious embarrassment that arises for the sake of gimmicks, so I would rather stay in the White Elephant Castle and not attend the banquets and dances held by the Emperor." Silk smiled, squatting down, and learning Augustine to take off a blade of grass, but because of the most basic restraint, did not put it in the mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like the city of Judit, I like the red, green and green dinners, because I like to wear masks, watching a group of people wearing colorful masks, talking about the beautiful praise, the aunty, chatting. The superficial hypocrisy, a group of clowns happy and happy, counts and counts, and more interesting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin swears, "unfortunately, the city of Judit does not like me." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very weird." Alice replied, playing the blade of grass, not knowing why a man of great aristocratic origin can swim. The poet bites the grass roots like that, but he can also enjoy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are a small person who is held by the barbarians in the palm of your hand. If you don't really go out, you won't understand the world of our men." Augustine smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand!" Alice retorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't understand." Augustine chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice was discouraged, and she really couldn’t hold her own opinion in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter if you don't understand. When you know me, it's like taking the first step, like this." Augustine pulled the blades of grass from Alice and gently Put it between her two lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s cheeks blush to contain grass blades and her body is stiff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a chance, I will take you to see the other side of the world." Augustine sat up, looking up at the hands of the Greenspan family's jewels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa is standing in the distance, looking at the two young people who are harmonious, the old man’s old and serious face is soft, and for a long time, finally Seeing Miss Alice standing up in the skirt and coming up to him, the old butler bent slightly and asked softly: "Miss, does the consul promise to be your private magician?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I didn't ask." Alice shook her head, but today's harvest has satisfied her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It doesn't matter, no young magician can refuse to be a private magician to Miss Alice." The old butler smiled and found the lady holding it. A piece of grass and chewing marks made the old man amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the carriage on the edge of the Black Swan Lake Manor, the old butler turned to find Miss Alice in the mouth, which is simply enough to see the true face of St. Urban. Alice smiled and said: "Asa, is it not a lady?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old housekeeper shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice then said an exaggerated statement that made the old man laugh. "He said that sometimes we should slap a sigh and go to his dog. -屎 Aristocratic etiquette."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice crossed her waist, licking the grass and looking at the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————————-<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin whispered back to the unrecognizable bottom The shaman of the 49 soul states in the sacrifice was swallowed by a third of the Nile and the black Mamba, and it was also an alternative to the soul that was originally imprisoned in the shaman magic array. The magical array is tirelessly pursuing two words, balancing, losing the sacrifice of 16 shaman soul support, and finally reluctantly maintaining a subtle stability, the loss of Elizabeth’s two golden subspecies small pets in several battles. In one breath, I have to make up for it. There is still a surplus. The most direct performance is that the two pets can no longer maintain a small shape. Two huge creatures with a length of more than fifteen meters are coiled in the bottom corner. The happy Lolly butler is leaning on the bottom of the head. Crazy laughter, two "small" pets spit out their tongues with relatives, huge heads bent down, gently squatting at the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stepped down the ladder, 12 the Zodiac Palace was completely destroyed after the Magic Array was launched, and St. Urban also went beyond the angels and demons in the golden species. Near the gods, although the main temple does not have the position of St. Urban, no one dares to deny that it is the divine authority of the executor, but there is not only one in St. Urban, in the process of summoning, Augustine learned altogether There are seven, who have just decided to stipulate the seven sins defined by the Bible. This is the arrogance of Urban, which was pulled out from the hell of Tartarus by God's left eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a contract for the master servant?" Elizabeth said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No human beings can bear the holy sacredness of St. Urban. It just descends on this world, like a bystander, and generally cannot leave poetry. The spring of the castle, the Bible says: God said that Satan and I exist among you, but never show up. It is very rigorous, it seems to be a world that does not allow the gods and the devil to easily break the balance." Augustine shook his head, he could survive, and he won a protector for cosmo. There is no regret anymore. Moreover, Dimit also benefited a lot. 14 stone monuments destroyed 4 pieces, and Dimit has entered the block. The stone with the blood of the Son, re-sleeping in the past, before entering the stone monument, the lecch, the king of the blood family, passed a message to Augustine through Urban, and each stone monument is the most suitable cemetery for long-lived species. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
