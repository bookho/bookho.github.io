			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Empire, a lady who has won countless applause and flowers, has three distinguished surnames in the full name, and at the end is Rotong Childe, but honestly, These are just the most inconspicuous of the three, because the first two are Fermoth and Constance, and the Rotongschild family is the pride of the empire, but the dragon among the thinkers and humans is the gold family of the entire continent. At that time, the lady chose Rountchild’s young poet among countless emperors, kings and prince candidates. The empire had kindly laughed that the poet’s duke married the lady, but married her. When she was sheltered by two gold laurels in a treason, she did not need to die, but she was still sensational, not an elegant widow who was still highly sought after. Now, with the secrets and ambitions of her nephews, the nieces finally came to this evil empire, which was severely condemned by the two golden families and imposed lasting trade restraint. Augustine did not regard these relatives as fools who could play, and showed their identity for the first time. They used the familiar white rose language and the relatively unfamiliar Oguja language. The two relatives showed different distinct attitudes. Constance, who was known for his barbarism and rudeness, was very happy to introduce himself. The name Uus is derived from Oguja's “Country Girl who was drunk by Dionysus” and sounds unrejected to this very feminine name. Fermoth, who is known for his warmth and gentleness, Miss Zusili from this family, but her eyes are cold, quietly picking up a slender heel, trying to completely overlook this peers from the spiritual world and geographical heights, that full The fresh and fragrant lady of wild gardenia gently pressed the foot of Miss Zusili, who seemed to have a good impression on the interim translation, just to express her own protest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am preparing for your accommodation in Alpha City tonight? I am a friend of Marseille and I am willing to offer the fullest enthusiasm to entertain both. But if you like the literary atmosphere of Champs Elysees Street, I can provide a room for the river, but the conditions may be relatively simple. Going to enjoy the scenery of Black Swan Lake tomorrow?" Augustine suggested. Just like a poor man, I saw the wealthy relatives who visited the door, even if they were sorrowful again, they would have to come up with a certain family. Apparently, Us was a courtesy aristocrat who was willing to accept other people's kindness, and there was no objection. Miss Zusili was not so good at talking. She refused Augustine's suggestion. She laughed and said: "Is it because your new home is better than Augsburg? The Duke’s Mansion is a little more than a dozen streets, and dare not entertain such a guest like me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elegant lady frowned, some inappropriate movements, she could save But the swearing words that ran out of his mouth were not able to save the field. The city of Augsburg was the birthplace of honor for the Rotongschild family. It was the sadness of the flower. City, deliberately used this as a topic, just like a face-to-face fight with Luo Tongzier, is a second-rate aristocrat who will conclude a bloody revenge. Her close up of Fermoth's Laurel Corolla badge? What is the significance? The woman with a calm face has some emotions, which is equivalent to even any gold family above the middle country, and a lot of strange aristocratic heirs. Miss Zusili, I don’t pay much attention to conversation skills. Acting as her translator does not seem to be a wise decision. Augustine’s face was surprisingly free of emotional ups and downs, but the smile acknowledged: “Black Swan Lake is not a place to entertain guests. The natural scenery is not bad, but when it comes to room decoration, it’s really not comparable to the wealthy families in Maso County. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine also added a gentle sentence: "Black Swan Lake is not my home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very faint statement, even the exclamation tone is not used, So the careless Miss Zusili didn't put it in her ear at all. She just insisted: "Go to the Black Swan Lake right away! Then you know that Holstein is more suitable for the battlefield than your Heze hybrid horse." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is ridiculous, this lady who has a certain degree of faintness and distant blood relationship with her, where is the narrow sense of honor, and, as if Is it a natural hostility that is influenced by the family will? Augustine felt that he could change the key of Zusili's decision, and he was in the hands of the lady. Then she looked at her with helpless eyes. The lady did not let him down, and pulled up the hand of the Fermos family sweetheart, smiling. "Zuzili, I am already very tired. Some can't stand the bumps of Alpha City to Black Swan Lake. I hope you can understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zu Sili The interpreter who borrowed from a friend's family of friends has always been very close, not very willing, but after all, it is still acquiescence. Before the party left the French Orange, the lady insisted on depositing the black pearl necklace at the auction site. Augustine respected her principle. She did not want to swear to protect the lady like a knight. Unexpectedly, this kind of non-gentleman's practice made Miss Zusili's impression of Augustine descend from hell to the next hell. Three carriages, the giant horse Holstein's Fermoth, the warm blood of Malderland's Constant, and the most common horse's gold balance badge, sailed to the Champs Elysees Street, this is the lady's decision It turns out that Augustine didn't disappoint her. The Witch Street, which has accumulated hundreds of years of unique literary atmosphere, is very suitable for rest. At the riverside bookstore, there are many writers who have written a good old book while drinking black tea. Augustine is monopolizing. After half of the Champs-Elysees, several large bookstores were transformed into hotels, but the overall layout of the bookstores was not destroyed. The top floors of the three adjacent and riverside hotels were opened up into bedrooms, and there were countless books at the foot. Luxurious, but absolutely unique, the ladies and Uz who live in the two hotels are very satisfied. As for the feelings of Miss Zusili, Augustine is too lazy to care about doing business like the faith of the people of the mainland, the customers are gods. But there are some names that are recorded in the gods, and there are always some that you can't care about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin lives alone in a smaller bookstore, and now the two girls of the Champs-Elysees, Agatha and Juliet, live here, Augustine Did not bother the rest of the guests, just let Agatha go to find a pot of scorpion flowers to the lady's room, and then let Juliet pick two lyric poems named by him, and send them together. Then I asked for a cup of the cheapest black tea. I sat on the first floor and looked at the "Apologetics" by the window. It was a book borrowed from the Verdun Monastery, telling how the devil sent teachers dressed in angel coats. To the world, under this tenet, the leaders and founders of some heretical sects became the devils in the "Apologetics". They denied the creation of the Lord and denied the Father's perfection and omnipotence. "Spear in the rice." "Insidious scorpion", with the ridiculousness of "the Almighty God can make a moving stone" to "destroy our father", Augustine likes to read this book, not its logical reasoning, but at its roots. Explain in detail, although there are still loopholes, but can be inspired to broaden their thinking, Augustine has seen many clerics with distinct personality, read many books, but still tireless, using the wisdom of the ancestors to make up for their own disadvantages, this forever The effort to reject narrow visions benefited from the magical teacher of childhood. From the aristocratic girl to Lolita, the relatively valuable slave, and then from the slave to the order of the chess piece, Juliet was edified by the big executive, and developed the habit of reading every day. At this time, she sat in the next door, doing the abstract. Occasionally looking up, glanced at Agatha, who was sitting on the opposite side of the order, and this vain vase, which was her belly, "the vanity vase of the descendants of the last artists", was destined to be the enemy of Juliet's life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agatha, who is more and more feminine, looks at the gap in the night view of the window and asks: "The order is long, why do you always like to sit in the window?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin turned his head and stared at the girl in front of him, smiling: "This place, you can see more scenery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Agatha smiled, full of worship, did not deliberately praise, she knows that the young and powerful Grand Executive is not a big aristocrat who will be impressed by any hypocrisy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin turned and waved to the hard-working Juliet, motioned for her to sit down together, and then personally pour them a cup of black tea, ignoring the excitement in their eyes. Excited, I painted two badge patterns on a piece of paper, a laurel wreath, a centaur, and whispered, "Do you know them?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They recognize each other One out: "Fermoos." "Constant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin exclaimed: "They are all ancient gold families, but unfortunately we There is no one in the empire, I hope there will be in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agatha cautiously said: "You can definitely lead the aster flower to become such a family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cautious Juliet did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled and said: "You should drink black tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls hurry to bow down Lipstick tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin no longer speaks, wait for them to finish a cup of black tea and say: "Early rest, tomorrow's Witch Street needs two energetic little masters." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girls don’t dare to spoil, drink black tea, and greet and leave. Augustine continued to look at the "Apologetics", thinking about the true intentions of the two families. Fermoth and Constance are different from the thin royal family, with a large number of outstanding heirs, these old and wise giants More than anyone knows the biggest disaster of a family, not a temporary loss, not the top ten gold family rankings from the seventh to the eighth or ninth, but the weakest incompetence of the next helm, Fermoth to any one The cultivation of the direct heirs began to pay amazing attention since the first day of birth, the choice of the godfather, the most elegant ceremonial officer for the children, the most profound literary teacher, and of course the powerful magic teacher and knight, and from childhood In order to arrange a future marriage, every step is full of wisdom, like a chess player who is the most proficient in Paya war chess, familiar with the rules and the meaning of each piece. Constance is more "rough and interesting". This kind of warrior with a dragon museum is very straightforward for the heirs. It is thrown into the battlefield. Whoever lives to the end, who is the next owner of the centaur badge? The most mentioned is that the owner of this family is often the illegitimate son of some big men, and each new owner who is accompanied by the killing of the upper class can inject more savage and bloody colors into the family. Kouss, a very elegant young man who lived briefly, seems to be different from the ordinary Centaur family members. As for the Miss Zusili, it is more appropriate to replace the family position with Us, which is inconsistent with the family temperament. Relatives, how do you look at the guests who are entrusted with the high hopes of the family, which means that Fermoth and Constance are perfunctory and not worthy of attention? Augustine's fingers knocked on the "Apologetics", which happened to be in a line: those short-sighted heretics, even in the most sacred church, could not see God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady who served as the translator appeared alone at the door of the bookstore, and knocked on the door with great etiquette. It was not too light and heavy, just to remind Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin got up and greeted, she said softly: "Just walked here, hoping that I didn't bother the reading of the Lord Archon."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin sat down with her and shook his head: "I am really sorry, there is only cold black tea on the table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The lady’s words and eyes are always full of convincing sincerity. “You are already a very considerate master. I really like the potted tongue and two poems. As a guest, if you are dissatisfied, it’s not Qualified guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin reluctantly said: "If Miss Zusili has a tenth of a lady's understanding, it would be fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady smiled lightly and did not extend on this topic. She glanced at the philosophical book of the scholastic that Augustine had already assembled, and asked, “Can I borrow it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin gently puts the Guardian Book Pushed in front of her, blinked and smiled: "Of course. Sharing gold coins with people may not be so pleasant, but sharing knowledge is definitely a very happy thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lady nodded, and the corner of her mouth slightly evoked a charming arc. Augustine saw it. The lady, smiling, just meant not to hate, but the more subtle, small-edged corner of the mouth proved that she was really happy. Augustine had some memories of some of the time buried deep in his heart, but soon converge on this thought and re-enter the battlefield. Yes, it is the battlefield. The singer of the Setters family, Dimit, once said that its owner is more like a family from the battlefield than to enter the battlefield. At the time, Augustine replied that I did not sit from a throne. On another throne, the prince's servant smiled: This is only a matter of time. Augustine is hard to go to dislike such a servant. The lady just turned over the preface to the Guardian Book and returned the book to Augustine. Unfortunately, this is not a book she will spend time reading carefully. This is in Augustine’s expectation, so he sent Juliet to send it. A book, A Reed of Thought, is not a book. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not an interlocutor who will be cold in the atmosphere, looking for an entry point, curiously asked: "Try to ask a question that has been bothering me for a long time, since The first Holy Scriptures of the Vatican's Holy See clearly stated that 'not those who recite the Lord, the Lord, can enter the Kingdom of Heaven'. Why did you belong to the Ola, but more than any monastery and god of the Empire? The college is even more demanding to pray six times a day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine thought for a moment and calmed down: "The Gospels, vol. 16, s. 49, 'It is not the Lord, Lord, you can enter the kingdom of heaven, but those who inherit the will of the Father." Madam, the latter half is actually The answer has been given. The reason why Vedola is sacred is not the hard form of the six prayers of the day, but the 'passing the Father's will' behind the form of a small group of people who are regarded as rigid and rigid. I believe you know that since the establishment of Vedola, I have not received any donations and did not participate in any feast. If it is only a generation of people, it may be described as an alternative gimmick, but this is a tradition that has been inherited for hundreds of years. The saints who came out of Deola, the Patriarch and the Archbishop of Red, even at the high position, also left the monastery to insist on these tedious prayers, but these prayers are often not valued and known."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. laughed and asked: "Are you the same?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin changed his point and said: "I was the same year. I wanted to be lazy, but I was punished by the godfather for countless times. The book has to develop this habit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady's mouth re-emerges, sincerely said: ""Teaching" has no loud praise."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled and said: "That was not what my godfather wanted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like "teaching" "The sentence "Whoever raises oneself will be depreciated; anyone who suppresses himself will be exalted." The lady nodded. Any book is the author's confession, careful readers can use this to spy on the author's inner world, she is such a reader, so she respects the saint who wrote the "teaching". At this time, the young man sitting in front of her is the classic interpreter of this Holy See. Her curiosity has never been heavy, and she also has some small doubts, hoping to get answers. When Augustine saw that she was not ready to ask at a time, she fell into her own contemplation. The last time the teachings of the godfather's sewing were broken, when can the remaining five volumes of "teaching" be published? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This identity is still a shadow of the lady transferred to some of the more relaxed topics, Augustine rich travel and wide reading makes him deal with it very easily, this lady turned out to be I have an understanding of the administrative systems of various kingdoms. Otherwise, there are only five fixed Duke titles of the Ogka Empire, such as "Bavaria", "Andersen", "Sassson", "Brandenburg" and "Stefan". The evaluation of the Earl of Bengbu is also very pertinent. There are both the softness of women and the calmness of bystanders. When the topic is transferred to horses, she even knows the young orphans of the Ulm army in the northwestern empire. When the other mares are fostered, the groom uses the "stepmother" milk to smear the cubs, thereby increasing the degree of reception of the mares to the orphans. She is also very familiar with the court life of several empires, and on the "The Wealth of Nations" It is more proficient to the familiar word. With the expansion of one topic, Augustine is increasingly appreciating that this knowledge is not limited to the graceful poetry and the lady of knight literature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the brisk and bright conversation, the topic is re-transferred to a heavy but not heavy religion. This is undoubtedly the most representative field of Augustine. You see, this is a thoughtful and intelligent lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked in a puzzled tone: "The teachings tell us that our bodies are the palaces of the Holy Spirit. Then those who are judged by the Holy See as heretics What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inquiry has already touched the last five volumes of The Instigation, and Augustine hesitated, explaining this sensitive question in a vague and general way: They are just lost lambs in the jungle of the church outside the palace. If they get lost, they can still be redeemed. Maybe we can't use words and gestures to point out the churches for those who are nearsighted, but we can lead them in person. Way, with them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady looks at Augustine, this is her first time so focused on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled: "The answer to this question is just an ordinary reader who has just finished reading the "Apologetics.""<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. smiles intoxicated and gets up and says goodbye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the lady left, Uz, who did not carry a servant, came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a very honest aristocratic heir, "Augustin cousin, my family wants to know that you need help now, because you are already being Constance The author's recognized heir, for a more direct statement, is that you are now a qualified contender for the next Centaur badge. Of course, I am not destined to be your enemy. Constance is hungry for you, not a family member. Can't afford the mediocre heirs of the long sword and shield. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin replied: "No. I know to be a 'competitor' of Constant, there is Two basic requirements, killing a competitor and completing a family-arranged task are unsolvable problems for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U Si is puzzled and takes greater sincerity. He said: "These two problems are not easy to solve, but it is not easy to become a competitor. You can get some valuable resources in your own right. Augustine, plus you, this Constance has only 12 competitors, like It has been excluded from the ranks of the heirs, so I am now your cousin, you do not need to worry about this. This time I came to your empire, just to be a dragon armor symbolizing the identity of the 'half-horse contender' Presented to you, it is a very high collection of our family museum. It is made up of three high-end dragons picking the skull. It is called the 'leader will,' so the family really values ​​you and puts you very well. The fourth place!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine calmly said: "According to the rules of Constance, if I accept the 'Leader's Will', I will be drawn to compete with whom?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uss is a bit awkward, Whispered: "The Turing in the second place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine laughed: "Us cousin, is this a bad news? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighing Uz did not deny, but still tried to convince Augustine: "But accept any challenge, stepping on the tops of all enemies, including relatives, is Constance." De's first house rule."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a pale and empty speech. For example, in this competition, a pair of fathers and sons were drawn to kill each other. Unlike Augustine, they readily accepted the fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin showed a very inhuman stubbornness, "I refuse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uss In a more euphemistic way, "I hope that you will win. I believe that you are a winner who will become a friend in the future and can speak to me. I can represent an important sideline of my family in the Constance. Will bring you all the support you can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled: "Us Cousin, I don't want to conduct business temptations with you now, but I really can't accept this kindness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uss looks a bit sloppy, but still does not give up: "Augustin, you also saw my obedience, that is just me The tip of the family's iceberg, can't you make you feel tempted?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shook his head and said: "If this competition is ten years late, I will not hesitate. Promise you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uss reveals a stubborn smile, take a deep breath, do Resolutely said: "Well, you may be a few guys in family history who are willing to refuse to compete. I am very happy to know you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin self-deprecating Tao: "I know that once I refused, I will be refused to be recognized as a descendant of the Centaur badge for the rest of my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More like a poet than an ancient Uss, the orthodox successor of the family, sadly said: "So I hope that you can think about it again. After all, you are one of the twelve people closest to that position. This kind of opportunity makes many people tremble at the thought."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine joked: "Us cousin, at least you are not, so we can sit here and talk about some small topics, there may be no ideals and ambitions, but we can draw closer to our late friendship and affection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their next conversation was very casual, and Augustine also learned from Us, that Zusili was just a Miss Mars, who was away from home by the poetry. However, her father did not kill the daughter’s arrogant, but let the innocent daughter on the priest who went to Bailuwei’s midway. All this, Miss Zusili, who had no genetic family wisdom, never knew it. She just thought It’s a cool feat to take a servant like a female knight in a strange field. In the city of Jupiter, which is very close to Maso County, “lucky” met a friend of a friend who understands her behavior very well. Madame, when she arrived in Alpha City, Maso County, she learned a few words of the sacred imperial language that was utterly utterly utterly utterly sung by her, and felt that she could read the most embarrassing scholastic philosophy of the empire. , This is Miss Zu Sili unique bright confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell to the cousin of August, Augustine went to the night outside the door, walked along the riverside path, but inadvertently saw the Zusili who barefooted into the river She sat by the river, standing behind the burly clock tower geek Kassimdo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is ready to take a detour, but he is shouted by Zusili, and if he does not stop, he will be thrown into the river by the giant Han, and Augustine is actually I didn't want to show the force of the Ministry of the Ministry with a relative here. I walked over and stood by the river. Compared with the stranger, I was farther away from her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss’s question is very straightforward and very vulgar: “I heard that you are the youngest giant in the Vatican’s Holy See. How do you do it? Is the patron of the saints paving the way?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin replied: "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Zusili swears: "It's sad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine continues: "I think too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She stepped on the water with her feet, splashed water, turned to look at Augustine and said: "Where do you have a little bit of dignity of Fermoth's descent? Even if you only have a negligible one-tenth You should be ashamed of it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine said plainly: "I think I should be ashamed to go diving right away, but I am afraid that this death method does not match the glory of Fermoth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zu Sili The lady was quite satisfied with the first half of the sentence, but finally heard the irony of the latter half, and immediately screamed and ordered the servant to say: "Casimodo, throw this guy with no sense of honor into the river!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weird people are saying: "My mother said that we should treat people who have never committed a crime in good faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss nervous Angrily said: "You are an idiot, you are an orphan, no parents!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The geek is stupid: "My mother said that only those who are not good The tree of fruit, only to pick up the axe placed on the root of the tree, must be cut down and put into the fire. But Kassimdo, like this person."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine smiled and said: "Casimodo, I like you too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zusili patted the water with her hands and feet "I am mad at me, a fool, a coward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin ignores this neuropathy, just whispering to the geek: "Casimodo, you are the sage The latest nine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The geek scratches his head and looks at the lady. He doesn't seem to know how to answer this question, but he doesn't want to lie but doesn't know how to cover up. all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zu Sili stopped his violent action and stared at Augustine with vigilance. Casimodo entered the sage and became the only human leader. This is a fee only. The secret of a few people in the Mormes family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin whispered: "No need to be nervous, I am just guessing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not good at headaches Zusili, who wasted time, quickly ignored it. She was not like a member of the "thinker" Fermoth. This lady who likes to whip up to the ceremonial officer is recognized as a small family. naughty. There is no literary poetry, painting, financial management, and so on. All the essential talents of the celebrities, swordsmanship, ridiculous, magical rumors, all of them are inconspicuous, but this does not prevent her from getting the favor of her father and the old master. Who makes her a naughty little guy who is the most extraordinary in the extraordinary Fair Moss because of the ordinary? But no one dares to paint on the face of the old home of Fermoth. The awful thing is that the impromptu work is so irrelevant to talent, even if she adds to the lady’s precious oil painting "Mrs. Seanley". Two beards, the old master is just laughing, blocking the grandson's punishment for this naughty granddaughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
