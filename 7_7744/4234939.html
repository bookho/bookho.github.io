			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mother Persian cat is comfortable with the owner, Augustine will definitely reward him with a candy, but will never give two, because too much Now, it will one day stick out its claws to the owner. Even if it is naughty, it will scratch the owner who does not know the training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Help me wear it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He puts up the quill and pats Mrs. Quentin The white and rounded peach-shaped arc indicates that she got up. Behind the Gaia mask is Mrs. Quentin’s grief. Augustine examined the trial book written in the Sardinian Doctrine. There is no grammatical error, no characters. He closed the book of the Holy See, except for him, and stood up and told her to sort out the clothes of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignore the murderous look of the kitten, Augustine looked into the iron cage, in a good mood, slowly said: "Determine whether a race can occupy a place on the mainland or rule The key to status is fertility. You look at the dragons, each individual is similar to the existence of God, but they can only give birth once a low fertility rate, so that the world's most powerful creatures are limited to inhabiting dragon veins. Unless the full-fledged warriors try to kill the dragons, they generally do not actively attack humans, not because they don't want them, but because they are humbled by ants but humble but numerous humans. My private magic teacher once said that human beings are the ones. The most fundamental factor in the world’s most prosperous race is that human beings can be in estrus every day. Aunt Quentin, do you think it’s right?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Emotion?”< Brd/><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin, who was helping the Augustine to take care of her clothes, sneered, "Do you need me to answer this question? Belief in the saints can be on the Sabbath with a '婊? 'Knight adults occur physical relationship "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Mrs. Quentin Augustine threw her on this significant comment to heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, yes, our actions justified this conclusion." Augustine stunned, his eyes continued to stare at the Colosseum, "the birth of a half-orc The force is probably the zero point of human beings, but humans finally defeated the two dark monarchs, the wolf and the vampire, on the epic continent. The poor half-orc was a street mouse in the Muse, and the 72 seats in the Muse semi-god parliament, but Symbolic charity gives a seat to a vast array of half-orcs. This is a very interesting phenomenon, and racists are also puzzling. I can only see one reason, that is, the creator does not like this failed work." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original Dark Archon was not only a good conspiracy and a profound theologian, but also a brilliant thinker." Mrs. Quentin sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Holy Empire has not had a true omnipotent since the lord of Otis. I have been working hard in this direction." Augustine's underarm "Sardinian Doctrine", walked to the floor-to-ceiling window, turned his head and smiled awkwardly. "Who said that the knight's hand can't play the piano on Mrs. Quentin's body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin snorted, but did not have a bit of confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to conquer a woman, please bring a leather whip and Caesar gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a ridiculous quote from a certain owner of Rotong Chald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine is convinced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the Tauren in the Mississippi cage was first chased by several shamans to the junction of the Muse and the Camry Empire, and then the bounty hunter After the round-up arrest, the Bounty Association has reached an agreement with many secret organizations in the Muse mainland. One party pays the remuneration and the other party is responsible for expelling the prey. The two sides do not violate the sacred treaty established by the demigod and the two great churches, and profit from the gray area. A copper plate must be covered with the blood of the half-orc race. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tauren Chieftain smashed the ancestors in the cage and now is a despicable natural enemy, human. In the eyes of the half-orcs, human beings are synonymous with weak treacherous and cruel blood. When it was pulled out by a giant sword with an anesthetic on the back, it knew its fate before falling to the ground. Its only wish was to kill one more human on the epic continent. Therefore, it completely ignores the piercing of the knight sword and the burning of magical skills in the iron cage of the arena. It is a crazy collision. Once he grasps his hands and feet, he directly tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest difference between Mississippi and other arenas is that it adheres to a promise, as long as one walks out of the cage and gains free status, it can even become The Todd family's obedience, which is a glimmer of light for any slave, is true for today's seven mid-level knights and four magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are fighting for freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately their enemies are abandoning their survival, just fighting for the last dignity that has no retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the balance of victory gradually shifted from the initial stalemate to the traumatic Tauren Chieftain. It broke out all the potential of life, and exchanged the head-to-foot scars for the lives of two knights and a magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloody one caught a human knight’s neck that was unfortunately caught by it, and hit it on the iron cage, the rough five fingers of the nails all peeling off Clenched, twisted the neck wearing a white rose lock knight, the head and body divided into two, and attracted a burst of cheers from the Mississippi audience. A knight takes the courage to take the opportunity to slash the sword to the thick head of the head of the bullhead. In the arena, the knight will be assigned a temple ivory sword that proves the knighthood, and a sword that is more suitable for the fighting and melee. Known as "great hybrids." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great hybrid made a meritorious detachment, cutting the arm of the head of the head of the bullhead twice as much as the human female. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the bullhead turned his head and killed the red-eyed one. He stared at the knight who was afraid of retreating. It didn't even look at the arm that was cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhang Da’s big mouth and a loud roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It rushes to the knight, a brutal collision that puts the knight on the iron cage, the chain armor is forced into the body, and the blood splatters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the bullhead who ran away completely bit the knight’s head and bit it off. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frenzied atmosphere of Mississippi has reached a climax. Many nobles have shouted their voices, and some rich people who came from the emperor to enjoy special games. They are also in a hot and mad state. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp knight came into the unguarded Tauren Chieftain from behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This half-orc slowly turned his head, and the knight licked this gap and added gravity to deepen the puncture by a few centimeters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the head of the head of Niu Tau held the long gun and took a poke in it until the long gun pierced the chest and stopped. It was still alive. The iron cage gladiators were heart-wrenching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two magicians and two of them who have combat power, and one who sits in the corner and is stunned by the head of the bullhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cavaliers were only three people left, but they soon sacrificed one more. The sneak attacker was turned and chased by the head of the bullhead. The knight wanted to escape to the corner of the cage and grab the iron railing to try to climb up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fight for honor and fight for freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ok for the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sacrifice for honor, death for freedom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too stupid for a knight who is not determined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mississippi audience laughed and tried to ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the bullhead rushed past, the blood rushing out of the mouth and biting the ass of the timid knight, fixing him in the air, then reaching out and tearing off the knight’s thigh. Then bite the other leg with a big mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rider fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the bullhead spit out the leg and slowly walked back to the center of the cage, throwing the victory pieces out of the two iron cages, and squatting on the side of the court The most powerful aristocrat, the guy snorted and vomited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wins the pursuit and kills the remaining knights and magicians in the cage one by one. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the chieftain of the head of the deadly life was kneeling on the ground, and the arm with a big sword was stretched out, and the five fingers opened and looked up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a shadow in the Mississippi Arena, a big man quietly made a gesture of wiping his neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cage was opened and a great knight of armored armor walked in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be the end of this boring game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a glass wall was completely broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing a handsome knight and a young lady wearing a mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
