			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred empire’s royal palace has led to countless enduring trends in this country for decades, but the court itself is not luxurious, and the scale of the garden is far less than The center of the night watcher, such as the angel garden of heaven, is so magnificent and magnificent, about the number and height of the church, not to mention the large academies of the Academic Affairs, even some private monasteries and monarchs in the suburbs. The manor can't be compared. The only thing that can be handy in the palace is the owl fountain. Every time after the rain, a gorgeous rainbow can emerge. It is the only magnificent scenery of the Imperial Palace that can match its status. The smallest daughter of Jupiter the Great. Princess Relf likes to play here since she was a child. When she was a child, she was leaning on her head in her father's arms. When she was able to walk alone, she used to sneak out of the classroom in the boring and cumbersome etiquette class. The whole afternoon, until the emperor, who was diligent in government affairs, had to personally come to pick up his daughter's little hand. Today, after the heavy rain, Princess Ralph sat on the bench, under the delicate buttocks, a "Sumer Code" that was carefully cared for by a certain ceremonial lady, but there was still a small one sitting around. Princess's heart is as lovely as his father, Prince Columbine, the princess feels sad that his brother always likes to frown after returning home from a distant battlefield, no matter how hard she tries to reach out to smooth his frowning brows, no matter her I talked about how many jokes that I can hold on my bed for a long time. After a long time, my brother will continue to frown. This makes me feel helpless and hope that the little princess around me feels helpless. Is it growing up? Do you need to be unhappy when you grow up? It’s too scary to grow up. For the first time, she felt that she should steal less snacks. For Princess Ralph, the grown up is just as much awful as the Queen, who is the one who kills herself by horse, and who is more like the dragon who likes to walk the princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Goron is finishing a hand-written manuscript, tentatively named "Jupiter City and the Death Count of the Neighboring Counties", the subtitle is "Nature" And the political twin relationship, returning from the south, he began to study the birth rate and death rate of the Imperial Capital and several counties, but he is still hesitant to submit this unsuccessful Death Table to his father. He and his sister's brother, Schopenhauer, the empire's crown prince, handed over a wonderful essay on the migration of the imperial powers of the Empire some time ago. Both the father and the prime minister gave high marks, and Colum was very happy. He has worshipped this brother who was evaluated by the empire as the most like the emperor. Of course, he hopes that this brother who has protected him countless times can make a political contribution. The Crown Prince Shuhua is recognized as the best heir of the throne. Praised as a brave knight, a wise thinker, found a golden balance between conservativeness and radicalism. Prince Columbine believes that his brother will bring more impressive achievements to the empire in the future, and this brother is really very loving. Self and sister Ralph, in the court stage dramas where countless bloody tragedies have been staged, in the sacred empire, it is simply too boring for the onlookers, but this is the father and brother of the stage standing on the edge of the stage. Prince Columbine’s happiest thing, when he thought of this, Columbine, who had just been awarded a formal knight, showed a smile and kept secretly observing his brother. The little princess of the love immediately followed her mood. The Prince of Colum turned to look at the sister of the Torah, put the manuscript on his lap, and reached for the red princess of the little princess, and said: "Relph, Iroco teacher who teaches the mechanical principle can be mad at you. Be careful that our emperor will punish you for copying the "Revelation" prologue three times, and you will not be allowed to help me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little princess made a face and said: "You don't copy the prologue for me. I will go to your room at night to let you tell ten fairy tales!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp There was a headache in Columbine, and there were more stories. There was also a day to finish. He is now tragedy to the need to make up his own stolen fairy tale, ten? This is more complicated than writing a purely academic Death Table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Columbine was threatened to succeed, a guy who qualified to cross the gates of the court to take a look at the Prince of Goron and the little princess The head, Ralf didn't have to look up, he knew that it was Schopenhauer, and he turned his eyes and did not say anything. Very strange, she has not been close to this crown prince since she was a child, even if he is his own brother, probably young children are most sensitive to the bloodyness of the knight, there is a sense of birth and sparse. Prince Columb smiled and smiled. He didn’t say hello intimacy, but for some lonely Columbine, it was not perfunctory. Schopenhauer was familiar with the brother’s temper and face, but he would be caught in the armpit. This essay was thrown to him, sitting on a chair and stretching a lazy waist: "It is a new work by Cardinal Maupassant, only two copies, one for the Vatican, the Ministry of Information, one to send When I arrived at my father's desk, my father just asked me to give it to you. The road was turned over and it was very boring. In addition to the explanation of "Teaching", there are more than 400 inferences and examinations of theological and philosophical issues, even if published. I can't sell a few books."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Columbine smiled: "I am deeply sorry for delaying your visit to Napoleon, a good friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prince of Schopenhauer laughed and licked his brother’s neck. It was really slender. Indeed, some ladies were unable to compare the face and body of this younger brother. It was too weak. So even if Little Columbine is already a knight, he has already participated. In the war, Schopenhauer still used to regard him as a fledgling chick, and he needed his own careful protection. He half-bred his brother, and Schopenhauer lowered his voice: "Colum, you really didn't plan to get close to Aphrodite. Napoleon is my good friend, but you are my younger brother. I certainly hope that you can win the favor of the young moon goddess of the empire. If you want to be successful, I promise you anything!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Columbie smiled and said: "You don't want to be embarrassed about me. The lady of the North Ouwufu family can even refuse you. I simply add an inconspicuous one to the pursuer army. The loser, let alone I don’t like such a girl, it’s too good, it’s not for me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schopenhauer glanced at it: “I’m not acknowledging Failure, nothing like my brother!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coron whispered: "Then you go to recognize Constantine as a younger brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Schopenh smashed, strong arms that had already been relaxed Once again, this younger brother, who is not competing, threatened: "The kid, dare to ridicule me, believe it or not, I will immediately leak the heroic deeds of your nine-year-old bed-wetting to others?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloren rose red and said: "In any case, the emperor only said that Schopenhauer's brother is funny, I don't care, your reputation is definitely more damaged than me."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imperial Crown Prince laughed, and finally the relatives pinched the younger brother’s nose, sighed and loosened Columbine, and re-scheduled, if the Prince’s sitting label is Quiet, is a literati full of thinking atmosphere, then the prince of Schopenhauer reveals a distinct military color, perseverance and tenacity. In the empire, except for Pompey, the older and more depraved Playboy is earlier than the Crown Prince and the battlefield. Killing, no other big family child can ride a spear like Schopenhauer. The future master of the empire, under the personal guidance of the current emperor, learned to ride and kill. When he was a boy, he rode a tamed Heze bloody horse and began to accumulate moisture-free battles, such as this red. In the Gogol Plains battle, if it is not glorious hills, too tragic and too sad, the performance of the late war madness is too horrible and too eye-catching, the entire empire is destined to be convinced by the crown prince's style, for this irresistible fate, uncle Benhua didn't have much anger. Besides, he never liked the fat knight. For Rommel, Schopenhauer has always appreciated it. He hopes to be included in his youth camp. In his conversation with his father, he clearly expressed his concern for Longmei. He served as the deputy commander of the Grand Army, and the Emperor’s Majesty seemed to appreciate the grand view of the Crown Prince, so that the rare feeling of taking the North Ouwu Fu to make fun of his son was not invincible on all battlefields. Schopenhauer took the young man’s "Death Table" manuscript and lost interest after reading a few pages. The mediocrity of the bottom of the empire, he has been too lazy to understand, for the Holy Crown Prince, who controls the nobility, especially The fifty big families, who have mastered the scepter of the empire, so Schopenhauer has been committed to the construction of the superstructure of the kingdom. At present, the effect has gradually surfaced, and no one can openly question his The field of view is narrow. Schopenhauer felt that it was necessary to pull his brother back from his ambitions. He said: "Colum, don't always squander your eyes on such small things. This will limit your world view. Father said, governing the kingdom, politically. Short-sightedness is a hundred times more dangerous than a physical scorpion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Columbie laughed and said: "It doesn't matter, I can help you take care of a small estate in the future." That's enough. If you love to drink, I can help you cultivate the best quality vineyard on the mainland. If you have a good vintage, you can make the best wine."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schopenhauer pointed to the younger sister who was stealing music under a statue. The statue was a little angel who was concentrating on peeing, and the naughty Princess Ralph was stretching his fingers to play the little boy’s little sparrow, Schopenhauer I slap my head and say: "You are more desperate than our Princess Relf."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Goron laughed and said: "There is such a younger brother and sister. "You are really hard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Schopenh spread his hands, his face was annoyed but his eyes were soft and gentle: "Is there a more unfortunate brother?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the cheerful and warm conversation, the Crown Prince Uncle Ben rushed to the Green Patty Harbour, where the Gospel of the Empire created the latest Gospel, Napoleon Full of glory to return to the eve of the eulogies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Ralph saw Schopenhauer’s departure, and then he sat back and saw that Columb had more books in his hand, curiously asked: Whose work is it? Is it a fairy tale?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goron actually read the book carefully in his father’s study and shook his head: “It’s Cardinal Maupassant’s New work, this is a respectable priest, not only because he is a student of Saint Iyeta, but also because of his loyalty to the empire’s faith in these years. It is he who persuaded many philosophers who did not believe in religion. He chose a new one. The path different from Saint Aleksand, abandoning mysticism, and rationally guiding the rigorous logic of philosophical debates, and the most successful defense of this era for the doctrine, this book is the wisdom of this cardinal. The most colorful place is the old man’s further explanation of the teachings. Many of the gold that was frozen by the philosophers in classical speculation and public opinion were stripped of dust and dispelled the shadows, but it seems that the teachings of Explain that there is some discrepancy between the old man’s consistent writing Maybe, I mean, maybe this part comes from other people's quill pens."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Princess Ralph has never understood the words of his brother anyway, but Still very careful to listen, to be his little friend, the second ceremonial officer, Mrs. Ekaterina, but said many times, the elegant lady should know how to listen in good faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colum returned to God and apologized: "I said something you didn't like to hear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The little princess learns to sway his hand and speaks generously: "As a lady, Ralph is very patient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colum was amused, and Schopenhauer pinched his nose. He went to pinch his sister's nose. It was a family. "That is interesting to tell you. I used to hear a message from the head: a man without a woman. I can't go to heaven, and I can't go to hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little lady who can't understand is a serious saying: "It sounds like a very powerful look."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gollen’s collection of manuscripts shook and nodded: “This sentence is said by a priest who is most admired by the head of the team. I guess he may be this one. The person who does not want to sign the book. This sentence, the general meaning is that women are very important, Ralph, you can not say casually, it will make the priests very angry and troubled."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Princess Relf said: "The priest is really learned, and the most important thing is very gentle. I like this guy, brother, how old he is, whether he has a wife. And lover?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grond laughed, "Relph, you are now I want to marry someone? When you don’t like to play with the little sparrow, the priest, according to the private speculation of my head, only likes the mature lady.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Relph suddenly fell into a dilemma, the statue of the sparrow can be fun! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colum did not want to worry about the little sister, laughing: "Go play the little sparrow, I promise not to tell anyone."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little princess jumped and went to play under the statue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the statue is more unfortunate than the Crown Prince Schopenhauer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small warmth, in a distant Northland, but it is a stormy, magnificent scenery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A standard maiden-style pirate ship with a scarlet skull flag is in the thunder and lightning, this pirate ship is second to none among the Vikings. Huge, in general, Viking pirates are not only the ravages of the coastline, the natural predators, but also the excellent sailors and boat craftsmen, but in order to allow ships to sail into any port and river, these terrible locusts " The hull of the hull is not too large, and the narrow hull can bring the advantage of shallow draught, but this ship is a heresy at sea, an astonishing 40 meters, and the hull is made of the thickest oak. The keel of the vessel makes this rebellious work look like a real water dragon. The mast is the largest pine. This kind of wood can bring moderate bending in the storm, showing unparalleled adaptability, which fits the Viking pirates. The plague group's tenacious character. At this time, the rough Vikings who fought against the stormy waves were not timid, but they were excited and screaming. Each member protected the ship from being damaged by the wind and waves in their respective positions, and their eyes were trying to keep an eye on the ups and downs in the waves. On the surface of the sea, there seems to be a miracle there. The lightning flashes on their heads. Every pirate is almost unable to open his eyes because of the wind and rain, but this does not affect the screams of the violent pirates. It is too wild. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song that can only be said to be roaring is the ancient folk song that the Vikings passed down from generation to generation. It is not pleasant, but full of pride. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are from the fjord of ice and snow, barrenness and cold are not excuses for weakness, the best cradle for the strong. The war will enter the palace of the gods, and The ancestors sang together to drink alcohol. The retreat will fall into the abyss and will always be banned in the winter. Death is just a journey, why not end in heroic warfare? Cut off the enemy's head, cut open the enemy's chest and abdomen, and destroy the enemy's children. Is there a more just thing in the world? The Holy Ghosts tell us loudly: No!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pirates who circulate the natural violent blood repeat Ancient folk songs, waiting for the tranquility of the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the thunder that almost shattered the eardrum, for the Viking man, it is the best praise of the ancient gods to the children and grandchildren. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the pirates exhausted to the limits of their bodies, the wind and rain and thunder finally fell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most reckless and dangerous man on the mainland is collectively silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the stern, a hand grabbing the deck appeared in the view of the crowd. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More harsh than thunder, countless men nearly two meters tall slammed naked-chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing a head, an indifferent face, a long black hair, tied with the simplest and neat single ponytail, in the neck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very beautiful woman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if she is exposed to the sun, her skin appears dark, but there seems to be no more healthy women than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of Viking men shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their king, triumphantly returned! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of the Vikings, strength is everything. The biggest king is definitely the warrior who stood in front of the two gangs of viking pirates after they met at sea. The first hero who leaped to the enemy's ship board to kill the most people, only such a person, only the deck of the blood of countless ancestors at the foot of the innocence, is worthy of the head of every Viking, who once contend with Olympia and several cowardly groups Holy Europe! Such a king can win the respect of all enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She, the woman who jumped on the board and held the tail of a Dresser's body in her left hand, was their highest king! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the majority of the Viking Kingdom be willing to pay homage to the Valkyrie! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thick stream of blood pervades the water around the vessel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She slammed the trophy that was unfortunately discovered by the fleet and then strangled by her, the thick tail was tied at the end of the pirate ship, from the body of the water dragon The blood that has flowed out is not willing to disperse for a long time, and the follower's sailing route forms a bloody road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a jug that was thrown over by a man, with the strongest shochu in it, even the Vikings who dare to drink are reluctant to try. Don't mention the soft wastes on the mainland that are used to softening wines. The woman took a sip on her head and drank the wine. She did not wipe it. She just walked on the road where the Viking pirates automatically let go. She came to the top deck of the lookout and sat down on the mast. At dusk, the dark clouds gradually Dissipated, there was a sunset that had been coveted by the old man. This is a rare and peaceful scenery on the North Sea. A group of semi-wild and half-raised gulls hovered in the sky, and several submerged, foraging the Dreiser water dragon. The body, the woman sipped half of the shochu in a few mouthfuls, began to slow down, looked up at the fierce tyrants of the seabirds, reached out and took a tail of dark golden feathers, placed in the air, watching the distant sunset The feathers suddenly showed a fascinating golden yellow in front of her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sheilai, looks very lonely, hasn’t anyone dared to be intimate with your Hull number? A Dresser Water Dragon Can't satisfy your stomach?" A voice rang behind a woman wearing a bright red sea monster's tight-fitting leather armor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman lost her feathers and did not lift her head. The tone was hard and hard: "I have slaughtered eight Dresser water dragons for ten years, except for stealing me." When, when will you honor your promise?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slightly bloated black robe wiped the wine stains on his lips and sat next to the young woman. He shouted: "No hurry, anyway, before I go to the Thunder Temple, I promise you to go to Oguja, when is Turing wins or you win, a fact that is acceptable to Centaur. A neuropath that can be galloped with a family chariot, an avenger who can infuse the family with the purest Viking blood, Constance is happy to I welcome both hands and feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman known as Shelley drank and asked, "Have you seen your grandson? Looks like Not disappointed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man nodded and said: "I have seen it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women wrinkled Frowning: "You handed over the coat of arms? Instead of giving you the most optimistic madman before dying?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man kept silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman finally turned her head and asked: "This half-human has forgotten the abandoned child in the East China, begging for your grandfather's charity?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man cursed an Icelandic dialect and angered: "If he asks me, I will not give him a fart. Shelley, don't think that you are being used as a queen of power on the force." You can look down on all the descendants of the Centaur!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young woman sneered: "A man who does not dare to attend a half-party competition dinner is worthy of Raytheon." So much attention?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man smiled and said: “Sheilai, the more you grow up, the less cute you are, the woman sitting next to me, or the first time I saw it. On the battlefield will a white rose be placed on a good child who breaks the spear?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and said: "If goodness can revenge, I can go right away. Put flowers on each of the short spears on the battlefield of Oguja."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man sighed and sighed Nonsense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is a fickle animal. I want to be so simple and innocent that the lonely Little Shelley was in that year. In less than twenty years, it became a violent and cold. Mother dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man who is not willing to mention the hammer of Quake gently said: "Do you know, the child named Augustine, after seeing me as a mean grandfather, The first thing is that I was worried that I was entangled in the head and the shield. The last sentence is sorry, saying that I have not been able to protect his mother. I am older, but my eyes are not spent, I know that he really does not want to get from me. What, to carry out his unrecognized revenge. Speaking of this, he is more like a combination of you and Turing. So I am willing to give him a reason to move on, not the extra help, it is to him The disrespect. The Quake is not for you, not for Turing, but for Augustine, he is like a young me, like the Holy Spirit who chose to fight to the last moment in the mighty dusk."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterglow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man who is far away said to himself: "Sheilai, this world is very exciting. After I die, if you feel bored someday, challenge Hold Augustine of Quake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman said in a stereotype: "Are you sure he will be alive from the Temple of Thor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Raytheon smiled and said: "As long as you can hear that he is still alive in a few years, then you can. If my grandson is unfortunately dead, then the Quake will automatically Be my legacy to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and said, "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The picture squinted at the woman who grew up and stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brilliant, but finally aging, Raytheon, a Virgin world is coming to the top of the Valkyrie, quietly watching the sunset. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man and the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young woman looked up and drank the last bite of spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old chief of the alarming ministry of Constantine Leaving the empire map, the sacred spear sitting in the study room closed a yellow book, and said softly: "The friend has gone, and the enemy has to leave."<br /><br /> At about this time, a young giant from the underground world of the Vatican’s Vatican’s Holy See entered a dark room. The ground was a winter crown of the enchanted magical genius in the black magic, approaching the three with itself. Ten kilograms of blood is drawn, and the final sacrifice will be his soul, the proof of human beings as angels on the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is naked, stepping into the unknown darkness, and "inscribed" countless scars. In addition, there are three overlapping magical arrays on the back. Patterns, one of which is already dim, the other two still radiant, subtle but terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does the soul live? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a question that Lian Yuanbo theologians are not willing to ponder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man stretched out a hand and pulled his heart out of the body and placed it in the center of the magic circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dry blood that has been drawn into one hundred and four cumbersome lines begins to glow, like water rushing, resonating with another magical array on the ceiling to form a complete Vacuum and symmetrical world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will accept the torture of the dragon, the fallen angel, the abyss demon or the unknown soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For half a year, the poetry song castle once again saw no trace of order, it is said to go far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse does not understand why this cautious Augustine is going to take risks when he is most powerless. Is it a huge speculation that returns richness? Going to the relatives of the white rose, the Fermoth family, asking for a new chip? In addition to more professionally presided over the excavation of the Sunshine Passage, Ulisse did not mind completely taking over the underground kingdom. He even had a complete blueprint in his head. He first brainwashed the horns and took control of the hundred hundred in the hall of the undead. "Children", secretly planted a few soul seeds that are not so loyal to the old master of the Lich King, but the little queen probably has no Augustine can be spoiled, it is too boring, staring at Ulisse all day long. Later, even the Maja Shaman Xiaomeigen who did not know from what corner came out to join in the fun, which made the one-eyed dragon a little helpless, but this obstacle will not reduce the enthusiasm of the deputy order, but will only increase His fun, anyway, was left to play chess with young people. He was not asked to pay boring loyalty. Just now, Xiaomeigen has completely fallen to his side. No way, Ulisse can be more tempered than temper. The poor little queen aunt has to get along a lot, at least he will watch a feast with a long shaman, like a small game at this time: in the torture room In the secret room, Ulysse visited a iron hollow iron box that stood on the fire with a stubborn and stupid heresy. The fire had only a few small flames. It was not completely sealed. There was a row of small holes that provided air. As for suffocating and dying, then the deputy commander smiled and told the heresy: "You will be invited to this 'greenhouse', then I will put more charcoal, warm slowly, the temperature of the room will be slow Slowly exceed your body temperature, and then reach the temperature that can make the water boil. This process is relatively slow. In my experience, you can live for at least half an hour. Xiaomeigen, you give this game a name, I think you There is a literary talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;蹲Looking at the lively little shaman and laughing: "Roasted piglet?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse seriously nodded: "Not bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heresy tried to squeeze a sneer, but his lips were shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysses throws this brave man into it, except for the darkness, which seems to be destined to be a hot purgatory. Xiaomeigen couldn't wait to add charcoal. At first, Ulysses didn't stop it, but when the temperature was enough to make the prisoners feel uncomfortable, Ulysses prevented the chaos of the little shaman and added charcoal himself. The temperature is always in his hands, just like his desire to control the truth. After ten minutes, Xiaomeigen reached out and tried the temperature. He gently asked: "Is it hot to die?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressionless Ulisse gently said: "Is it very interesting to burn him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See more cruelty The killing little Megan grinned: "Of course!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse asked: "What is more interesting than scalding him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little shaman was stumped, thought about it and couldn’t figure out the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse did not immediately give the truth, but continued to master the heat. After half an hour, he heard the mourning inside and slowly said: "Humans are the most The three things that have been defeated are in the third place. There are dragons that once occupied the sky, plagues and floods, and second, the beliefs left by the gods, but first, since the birth of mankind, they have not changed. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Megan exclaimed: "Is it? So terrible?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisei’s mouth swelled in a curve, and he smiled sullenly: “It’s human beings.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little shaman is very unhappy with this shit truth, muttering: “ It’s our powerful shaman!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulose smiled and didn’t bother to refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, open the cage, the human heresy is soft, the nails are peeling off, the faces are awkward, and they die of fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Megan’s look at Ulisse’s eyes is like looking at the most dangerous demons, shocked: “You humans are despicable and terrible!”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysse shook his head and said: "Not everyone is willing to explore 'self" like me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the White Elephant Castle, Mrs. Quentin follows the order Asked to hand over a letter to the Earl of Marseille, who was finally determined to travel to the province of Richelieu as the chief executive. The orange auction house is still in his hands, but the new town owner has a certain percentage of dividends. As for the Black Swan Lake Arena, it is also officially profitable. More and more wealthy people are willing to come to the manor to pay for the violent fighting of various species. Although it is much slower than the Earl of Marseille, it is still a good news. It was only for the big executive who could not send off his friendship. The Count of Marseille was inevitably regretted. He walked through the creepy hall of the undead and walked down the ladder of White Elephant Castle, thinking of an empire on the family desk. The Prime Minister signed the letter of appointment, and the obese count felt that such regret was not necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Quentin, who can finally see the dirty sight of the fat pig, came to the castle and looked at the terrace. Miss Alice sent her every two months. A letter, in addition to the common topic between women, the barbarian princess always asks a few words about Augustine's current situation. Fortunately, Augustine has already prepared some information on the response, which makes Mrs. Quentin feel relaxed at the same time. Even if the demon does not have the pressure to bring it at a close distance, it makes her feel suffocated. He seems to always pay attention to every detail. It is simply impeccable. There is no poetry song he supervises, the brutal bulls Louis, the enchanting women. Fiona, the girls who make money on the Champs Elysees Street, double the crazy work to earn the horns of thought. No one feels that they can avoid the man’s eyes and be lazy. Mrs. Quentin’s squatting on the terrace stone fence is really a For the restless white rabbit, her chest is as spectacular as the mountain where the white elephant castle is. It is no wonder that Queen Elizabeth will not be pleasing to the eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a year, almost all the residents of the underground castle of the poetry song can hear the terrible sound of a dragon-like roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It comes from the long-term preservation of the dragons of Ulise, the will of the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse did not reach a reasonable result until standing in front of the fiery red armor with harsh tremors and violent vibrations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year later, the ancient tree of Ursula began to grow rapidly, madly spreading, aimless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But half a year later, the "tears path" of the mother of this land presented an odd tilt and concentration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
