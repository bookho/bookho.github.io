			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curious to kill the female cat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the noble Persian cat from the gorse, the lady of the Florentine family, Mrs. Quentin on a tragic and glamorous battlefield that she could not have expected , was "killed" by a young man three times in one breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin makes the face of the young baby's face full of emotions - the flush of the desire, she quietly wrapped the sheet with the one that was once worshipped by the Olympian Church Many bishops coveted the seductive body, after the end of an epic battle, Augustine was satisfied, finally let go of the tough and amazing mature-female aunt, sitting next to the crib with a smile, wearing too many cleaning times And the white shabby robe, turning his head and squinting at the woman with a complicated look, Augustine ridiculed himself: "Tell you a little secret that is irrelevant, I am a knight who specializes in saints in the devout faith."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You really are a madman." Mrs. Quentin frowned and said softly, she was already a dried nectar-peach, and she could no longer squeeze juice. Even if you want to express your inner anger, you are indeed not aggressive. Augustine talked about the most sacred saints in the Knights' faith. Mrs. Quentin, who didn't want to look at him more, couldn't help but glare at him. Generally speaking, the two Holy See Knights chose to believe in saints, which is very scarce, because that means A knight must be away from seven sins in his life. All actions will smother the inner soul according to the standard of saints. The man around him chooses this unpopular belief, but vents it on her for three hours. Buckle the madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, is it really so attractive to him? Mrs. Quentin thought of this unrealistic possibility. Suddenly, the mood was extremely uncontrollably bright, but it was quickly overwhelmed by her rationality and overwhelming hatred and indignation. She turned and faced the wall, as The high-end assassin's body is far more tenacious than the average woman, and Augustine's cockroaches are full of undeniable skill and poet temperament inspiration. Mrs. Quentin did not physically suffer the pain that she could not bear, before that. The meat-destination between men and women was regarded as a torment by her. Now she begins to understand why each kingdom has a flood of lofty devils who have been defeated by loneliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dignified and pure aunt Quentin, want to see how I exercise now every day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Augustine ridiculed and laughed, seeing that Mrs. Quentin did not move, refused to pay attention to the gesture, nor reluctantly, continued to seduce in a tepid manner, "When we first met at the Champs Elysees Street, I really only The nuclear capacity of the middle-level magician, the Holy Fall of St. Urban, which I created, helped me to unlock a shack that was attached to me from birth, so I am now like a nouveau riche, 9 major occupational magic, Knight, swordsman, arcane, assassin, bounty hunter, I have got the certificate of the first grade or above, and the remaining three are also involved in hunting. Do you really want to see it, the most amazing of all the legends? How does the professional master train?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The double-professional master is a strongman who has at least 10 major occupations, such as Hera Bolsefele, the great knight and great arcaneist. She is amazing enough. Mrs. Quentin is a minor in Ireland. The undead has reached level 13, but her assassin has only a high-level 8th level, so it is not a double-professional master. As for those who have studied four or five items but are low-level "squanders", they have been insignificant in the upper levels of the Imperial Pyramid. In this world, a sacred knight or magic sage who can compete with a small knight is the mainstream, but if anyone can take 9 major occupations and get the official certificate, in case There are a few that reach the middle level. It must be the talent that any empire has dreamed of. No matter what kind of battlefield it is, this combination of genius and madman is the easiest surviving epic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin did not hesitate to put on a magical robe that Augustine had thrown at her, followed him to a secret room on the seventh floor of the poetry brother, very It is spacious and huge. The ground and walls are made of special ore. It can absorb the penetration and destructive power. It should be a high-cost top training room. There are knights and various large guns in the corners of the hall. sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin walked to the center of the room, his hands drooping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a long gun inserted in the center of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any humming, the two hands condensed two red and black elements in the White Elephant Castle that made Mrs. Quentin tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin stood at the door and carefully explored the magical fluctuations of Augustine with the innate perception of the Irish Undead Warlock. Since she entered the cosmo and suffered the worst situation, she began to tell herself to learn to gradually adapt and relax, try to grasp more secrets and cards about the young governor. Maybe one day, she still has the opportunity to go out. The crows market antique shop is a quiet and peaceful female boss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand uses the red magic ball as a lever to summon a level 24 fire element magic red snake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand is centered on the black magic ball, summoning a 36-level water element magic whale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man at the same time makes the opposite of the two elements of magic, which is not easy for a powerful tulip magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 15. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin’s eyes widened and she refused to miss any details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin suddenly turned and threw the stately red snake and whale to the unprepared bystander Mrs. Quentin, a long flame snake and a huge blue giant The whale ran to the doorway in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin gave up control of the two magics and picked up the dark gold dagger that was robbed from the golden lion in the French orange, biting with his teeth. The rifle was then pulled out and rushed to Mrs. Quentin at a faster rate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the red snake and the giant whale strangled Mrs. Quentin, holding a long gun in front of her, the long gun swept an arc in the air, hehe! The flaming red snake was shredded, and the long gun swayed out from the hands of Augustin after the huge rebound. It was smashed away, and the giant whale had already rushed to the front of Augustine. Augustine bowed his head, bowed his body, and the dark gold dagger was in the hand. The whale's abdomen crossed, and it was incomprehensible to split it in half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remnant form of the whale that was split into two flaps rushed out from Augustine and Mrs. Quentin behind him, hitting the wall and making two roars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next is true, throwing magic quickly, and then destroying the magic skills created by the Knight Swordsman or Assassin Hunter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This crazy "self-abuse" lasted for half an hour. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin is completely speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope's lioness is enough to be abnormal, it seems that the fourth giant of the sacrament is not inferior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alsace Estate adjacent to Black Swan Lake It is the territory of the Todd family. Compared with the barbarian white elephant castle, the slender and small Lancôme castle is like a beautiful little dwarf, which reflects the different temperament of the two top families in the county of Maso County. Everyone Greenspan is carrying a rising and rising momentum, and Todd’s Marceau County has been a docile and well-behaved for seven generations and more than 400 years. There are no sturdy homeowners and no talented heirs. Stable, with a relatively mature family echelon, such a family is not easy to make mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancôme Castle hides in the dense woods, quiet and serene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ya Shi Manor is one of the three territories of the Todd family in Maso County. It has the smallest footprint, far less than the flower dew estate, only larger than the Black Swan Lake. On the previous point, most of the family members in the second and third line of the Todd family will go to Lancome Castle to set up some dinner parties or ladies salons. Just as the order is settled in the poems, Lancome Castle begins to be lively. Many emperors have begun to remember this insignificant little thing. Recently, a group of great aristocrats who have made friends with the Todd family gathered in Lancôme Castle, drinking the dynasty wine of the Marceau County, enjoying the slaves from Lolita. The exotic female slaves selected by the market, the most surprising thing for them is that the Ascott Manor has created a hidden underground arena. It is located under the racecourse behind Lancome Castle and can accommodate more than 400 people. Known as the fun competition point of Marshall County after the Marie Colosseum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cheap carriage without a family emblem enters the Ascott Manor, unimpeded, except for the competitive vouchers equivalent to 50,000 Caesar gold coins, and more importantly one The women showed the lion's coat of arms symbolizing the Greenspan family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Marceau County, it is a consensus to be willing to succumb to the bishops and not to provoke the barbarians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage is driving in the picturesque Estee Manor, the groom is a blond-haired teenager, his face is stiff and sluggish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the carriage, a young priest closed his eyes and his head was on a slender thigh with a "girl" full of flexibility. She had a pair of worried people on her chest. A little move will break through the fascinating peaks of beautiful dresses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her dress is not fancy, but wearing it on her will be full of fatal temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can be a pure maid, can be a sexy canary, can be a mature sister, can be a graceful lady, in the eyes of 10,000 men There are 10,000 of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do?" she wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "With your distraction, I said that as long as the kitten is obedient, there is candy to eat." The young man smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The same aristocratic accent as our gorse, greasy and hateful." She hated, but did not pull back her thigh to disturb his rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
