			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine, who was preparing to leave Jupiter City, was interrupted by one incident and was informed that he was invited to the Torch Institute for future gold clover badge winners. In one lesson, the content can be free. In Augustine's view, the absurdity of this request is almost inconsistent with the invitation of Queen Cher, who has nothing to do with the torch. He has a secret relationship with the sage of the apostle's head card, Spades J, in the empire. People know, and the most noble and unique Arcane sage in history has a relationship with the Imperial Magic Guild. Shouldn't it give Augustine a big problem and teach a group of geniuses? The class was held in the Colin Auditorium, sitting in a large group of arrogant young people waiting for the temporary lecturer to make a fool of the ugliness. Some old professors who have worked for half a lifetime in the torch work also collectively attended the last row. They certainly wondered that a 20-year-old was only in the empire. The youth of the magic guild who obtained the identity of the middle-level magician used to spread knowledge to the torch. Is it based on the heresy theory that the sacrament is best at? With this gimmick to try to change his bad impression in the capital? That innocent little guy is sure that he is not dreaming? Many of these young geniuses were attracted by the clowns of the traitor's descendants, and they were not expected to hear a useful lecture. And many people have heard that the beautiful lady of the North Ouwufu family will also participate, and this is in a hurry. At this moment, she sits quietly by the window, holding the gang, like the most talented sculptor of the same statue. The statue of the moon goddess coming out. I am afraid that York is the only guy in the classroom who has a strong expectation for the class itself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin arrived at the auditorium on time and put on a magical robe that matched his career. Without any wording, his opening remarks were exceptionally simple, simply boring and revealing. A pale, empty body of a typical uninformed person, "Today I only want to ask a question that has been thinking and has not got a definitive answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin picks up the chalk Write a question on the blackboard with a sleek Tara font: "What is magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young magician screams loudly: "Magic is something that will get you out of the classroom. For example, a fifty-thousand-sized Anna ritual."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin was not interrupted by ironic shackles, just calmly said: "Mathematically, everyone knows that 1+1 is equal to 2, but almost no one is thinking about why. It is equal to 2. When I was a child, I also asked a private magic teacher this seemingly naive problem, but she did not give me the answer, just gave an example, with a ruler with a length of ten centimeters and a minimum scale of one centimeter. Measuring a nine-centimeter object is not difficult, it is not a fool, it can be done, just like me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a burst of laughter under the counter, but there was less ridicule. For those who are happy to laugh at themselves, it is very difficult for ordinary people to give birth to hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if you measure an object that is nine centimeters and two millimeters, you need a more precise ruler. You need to measure the person to create a long rule that is accurate to the millimeter. This, fools can't do it, but sitting in the audience and wanting to hear a fool is really a waste of time, you can do it. This is why you entered the torch. When I was young, I dreamed of entering the holy Carol is more glorious torch, and then it is better to get a knight title, riding a horse wearing a magic robe, very eye-catching, Miss ladies will scream, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The laughter is even stronger, even some old professors will smile, who is not mature from childhood ignorance? Childish children and adolescents, who are not eager to be the focus? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if someone asks you how to explain the infinite loop unit of root number 2, what should I do? I am afraid that you can't solve the headache if you eat the ruler." Augustine smiled and turned to draw a standard triangular pattern on the blackboard and knocked it on both sides with chalk. "The mathematician will say that we can solve the problem that is destined to be measured by the long rule by the two known sides. The number of infinite loops. Although this number is still abstract, but at least it is not a mess. This is the role of leverage. The knowledgeable professors and any one who can easily find out a little Anna’s fireworks let me go, obviously They are very good at using this kind of leverage."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone laughs, including the pretty woman of the moon goddess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have always believed that magic is a sacred object that can and must be accurately calculated. So, when we can use leverage, can we be complacent? Still further, to explore the source of leverage? Is 1+1 equal to 2? What is magic in the end? Every magician knows that there is a gift of magical deity in our body, it is nuclear. It is like a labyrinth, we need to At different stages, with different keys to open, you are all lucky, more than the ordinary people opened the maze, remember the first smart person who came out of the labyrinth of Pan God in the mythology? Quite simply, he prepared a bundle of long lines before entering the maze. After finding the golden wool treasure, he was guaranteed to return. What did it tell us? Of course not only he was a lucky fool, but he did not forget to crack the original thing of the maze. That is where the starting point is. Every time he takes a step, he is working hard to return to the starting point, and he has never forgotten it. Then you, I will be asked by you when I ask this question. Think of the geniuses who are semi-mysterious and esoteric? Do you remember the origin that is more than the starting lever?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd began to think in unison, and some young people who were accustomed to self-confidence because of their talents tried to refute, but they were speechless in vain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic is a maze, not to be confused by its fascinating illusion of truth. It is actually a strictly one-way deconstruction. Puzzles, no matter how many years you walked in the magic field, how many honors you got, how many puzzles you solved, you need to warn and remind yourself, I forgot the way to come? The magician is undoubtedly a distinguished profession. With a little achievement, you can harvest flowers and applause, but my two magical teachers, one more than one, ignore the praise or ridicule of the onlookers. The grand dinner of the aristocrats? The olive branch of the nobles? Talk about it? I think, these are still handed over to the knights to accept it. The magician is more suitable to bury the book in the long scroll. Your silence is far more conducive to the construction of the human knowledge ladder than the rhetoric. This process is destined to be difficult, but Isn't this the ordinary that the magician pursues? My godfather said that there may be occasional amazing feats in a person's life, but the rest are all insignificant. Micro-details, even boring manners. Without this tolerance to mediocrity and dirt, you can't put on a sacred coat. I believe that the most suitable character for this sentence is not a politician, but a magician."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a round of applause, York, the moon goddess of the empire, and six or seven old professors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Next, I will talk about some of my own understanding of what magic is in these years. It may be somewhat different. I hope that the end of the class will be urgently notified by the Imperial Magic Society. I am no longer a magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, this day, Augustine, who was greeted by arrogance and applauded, never looked at it. At one glance, he was born with him in the Empire Moon of Augsburg. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, Augustine’s carriage was about to sail out of the capital, and he received a secret document from Jupiter’s emperor, and signed a copy of the border between the empire and Kami. The extraordinary subsidiary agreement means that his name will officially appear in the history book of the Empire for the first time, and it is a pacifist who has emerged from the historical waters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saxon Forest is ridiculed by the commander of the order who is about to act as a "large meat grinder" and "the best college of the imperial knight", then the empire The county borders the Titans on the southern border, and that is the real battlefield. Here, the two sides explode the most cruel battle on the epic continent at the highest frequency. Almost every two empire battles have invested more than six digits. The black rose withered one time, the army of the regiment started up to twenty-one. Originally, according to normal developments, it will be the most turbulent war on the mainland in the past 100 years, the large-scale Knights, the most complete mage echelon, and so on. All the soldiers will join in and bloom a military observer. The bloody and arrogant "game", of course, history always comes to a joke when everyone waits and sees, and that year, a completely black rose with a near-unrepeatable glory falls into the dust. Finally, this year, a new opportunity was ushered in. The son of the war hoarded nearly 200,000 soldiers at the border, and the sacred empire was not to be outdone. The knights, the spears and the spears, gathered 140,000 imperial soldiers. Plus 15,000 wizards, this ratio is enough to make the emperor king of any country covet and fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white whale fortress that guards the southern gate of the Holy Empire will be a star. The Marquis of Pompey, who commanded two jihad wars, was called the Earl of Dürer, born of a war-born army leader, Robert, who was a half-level higher than the general chief executive, and rumors that he would soon become the latest title of the empire "Marshal "The first member of the "Titan Reaper" General Orem. Everyone is convinced that as long as they win this war, the ranks of the highest ranks of the Imperial Marshals will be arranged for these people. Some unnamed military leaders are also eager to try, and for the family to seek higher glory for themselves. reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the lowest-key "war commanding artist", General Monte Cristo, privately told his friends that he also hoped to make a successful conclusion for the military career. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man has always been recognized as a talented conductor of thousands of small and medium-sized battles with an infinite number of close to one hundred. He used to be the military teacher of Prince Adis, and this alone is enough to make him the innocent king on the battlefield. Moreover, he has always been the enemy of the Titans who tried to use the assassination to dispel the disgraceful way. The old man was forced to deal with the assassin and the bounty hunter for half a lifetime. The old lover of life is always laughing and saying that he has retired. Invite the leaders of these two professions to have dinner together and celebrate that everyone can finally take a break. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these big men still maintain a sober vigilance, then a group of newly-launched upstart knights are mostly enthusiastic and enthusiastic, shrouded by hot emotions, the eastern part The family came out of Constantine is a good example. The genius young hawks group with the genius double professional masters as the core plans the beginning of the war and calculates the general trend. The nobles of their nobles are the most noble, most of them. It is the heir to the first-line family of Jupiter City. After rushing to get the title of knight, he rushed to the Beluga Fortress. The most dazzling thing is that there is a special knight in this small group, Prince Schopenhauer, one of the most favored by Jupiter. The heir to the throne, it seems that the prince of the prince did not hate to be together with the classmates of Morgan College because of the rejection of the love of Constantine’s sister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, there is also a knight group with a clear line of boundaries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of them are made up of civilians. Correspondingly, the younger generations are slightly older, and very few young knights in their early twenties are mostly close to 30 years old. Different war medals. Most of the six-level yellow sunflower medals, because this medal is the only way for the civilians to advance to the new aristocracy, and almost the basic honor of a Dalangtong war badge, their common point is that there is no glorious surname, nothing. Unaccompanied ancestors, everything needs their own hard work. They are not in the same Knights. They often meet to discuss issues and have extraordinary cohesiveness. No one doubts that once the war breaks out, these middle-level young officers can tacitly interact with each other. Coping, playing some beautiful little battles. This group, there is a shadow leader, a civilian knight who is a few years younger than their average age. He was the only one who won the title of the Knight of the Rhine King Round Table in the ceremonies of the Imperial Palace Labrador Crystal Hall in previous years. First-class iron oak military medal and second-class Poor valve 孜 badge monster, that year, even the rogue knight who was named because of the enchantment of Andre’s daughter, was stunned by him, so that he was rumored that Marquis Pompeii I intend to marry my beloved daughter to the subordinates who are known for their talents and martyrdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these two young factions with good reputation and strength, the rest is quite funny. The first one is undoubtedly the most noble, the second is because of the most heroic, so the highest rate of casualties in the war, and the last one is the highest survival rate, but the reputation is terrible, afraid of death, hey, don’t understand Knight etiquette, the charge is slower than the turtle but it is faster than the rabbit. God knows how these shameless knights wear badges one by one. Everyone is puzzling, only because they have a despicable leader. A freckled fat knight Rhein Hatai, the emperor's veteran soldiers were very angry about the military's award to the bastard iron oak badge, almost to jointly protest, but because of the ruin of Luo Tongchaid, who was not dying at the time, was reluctant Hold back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Beluga Fortress Chamber, the generals decided to battle on the huge map that was spread out on the long table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the Chamber of Deputies, it is a coincidence that the four young knights who are more interesting in their camps are standing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father of his friend, Dürer, called for the command of Constantine. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Imperial Capital and most of the first-line aristocratic heirs who are very good at playing but belong to the father's faction, no one has sent a little bit to this number one playboy in Jupiter City. I hope that this guy will be able to move a spear of three or four meters long? Can you put on your own weight? <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fat meat today, Rhein Hatai, who specializes in talking to Nero's cover about Augustine's news, hangs a face that makes Constantine very disgusting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a monster that deliberately opened a distance with the three, and was regarded as the successor of Rommel by the old General of Monte Cristo. According to common sense, he should have a good relationship with Nero when he came out of the Marquis of Pompeii. But it is obvious that the young but the glory of the monsters did not have a good impression on Nero and Constantine. On the contrary, he just nodded with the iron oak, and he stood in the corner, holding a pair. I don’t know what I’m thinking about than a woman’s beautiful peach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero is coping with the fatter of the dead fat man, and his eyes stay more on Rommel. This is a younger man who is more handsome than him. After discovering this truth, Nie Master Lu is a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fat man is brazen and shameless: "Master Nero, rarely sees a knight who is more handsome than me."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that when I was flattering, I didn’t forget to brag about myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero can’t believe that this shameless fat man and Augustine are from the same family, stiff face, don’t know how to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty continues to tirelessly close: "Nero Master, need a fine wine? My men brought a lot this time, this is the order I gave them. If you want a girl, I also know where the beluga whale can satisfy you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this knight’s shit, he is good at ridiculous Nero in the path can only smile. How much courage and enthusiasm do you need to bring your wine to the Beluga Fortress? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military meeting of the Chamber of Directors came to an end, and the fat knight was stunned and stunned by a whole circle of big men, which was reluctant to follow Nero’s young master. Say goodbye, and throw a deep smile on the "Nero Master you know", when the father cast a doubtful look, Nero really regrets should not know this fat man. Constantine followed Dürer to leave, Nero and Rommel followed the Marquis into a lounge. The owner of the Pompei family asked a hand-drawn rumored Rommel some routine problems, Nero sat. On the side, it seems bored, only to appreciate a porcelain bottle from the subcontinent peacock dynasty. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the empire’s most dazzling war star, Rommel, stepped on the hard pace of a very personal style, the Marquis slowly retracted his gaze, with a deep tone: "This is an unreasonable young man. Old Monte Cristo is famous again. Is it better for me to be a backer? Isn't he aware of the rejection of the marriage that countless young people in the empire desire? I made a clearing of the camp? Nero, you are about the same age as him, talk about your thoughts. Your sister, but now I am crying silently."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Nero finally stopped touching the vase, and smiled brilliantly: "Want to hear the truth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-ranking Marquis glanced at the outsider’s eyes. Son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero said: "First, my sister, Miss Mary is really not beautiful, if I am Rommel, I am not willing for the next forty or fifty years." Face a woman who is not beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero continued: "Second, father, the faction you have, so many real powers, even the generals have several, but others can discuss, in addition to you, remember the second person?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis smiled. "But don't forget, Rommel is just a civilian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero shakes his head Road: "In the next half century, the empire will open the door for the civilians. Now there is a door crack, who knows what the next situation is? Old Monte Cristo, has always been more willing than you to position and glorious Let the younger generation. Even if this Rommel has no desire for political power, but since he is the best military strategist in the future of the empire, it is inevitable that you want to get a broader stage, you are only in your forties, but old Christ. The mountain is almost seventy years old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis nodded, but was somewhat lost. Being able to make Pompey’s family so stunned, it is obvious that Rommel is a pure soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Marquis seemed to think of, reminded: "Don’t be a fat man, if you are interested, you can study the military papers he submitted to Morgan College these years. Exaggeratedly speaking, he is one of the commanders in the empire who are most familiar with the Titan military and can put the theory into practice. His research on the Shibao net chain, the plain knight war and the max value-added expansion of the mage are all classics of Morgan College. The official textbook, just considering his reputation, the college has not labeled the author, for fear that the college will have a rebellious mentality, and is unwilling to accept these precious things that will bring them invisible shelter in the future battlefield. So you are free to accompany him. Drinking and drinking, I heard that he has been studying a very unpopular naval battle recently. You can see if you can dig something interesting from his mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero Eyes flashing: "Sea battle? Bypassing the plains, straight into the fragile abdomen of the Titans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marquis Pompey smiled and said: "How, coincide with you." Ok, finally find a match. Are you the same type of madman who jumps in thinking?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero said: "Somewhat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Marquis of Pompey regrets: "The reason why I have been cultivating Rommel in the past few years is that he is similar to the keen sense of the old Monte Cristo. This kind of genius, the commanding talent that erupted in the small and medium-sized battles, is You can directly decide the outcome. It is very appropriate to call them war artists. Nero, you are different from this kind of person. Your greatest strength lies in the powerful mastery of the whole war, but any perfect strategy needs to be I have a subtle tactic to pave the way, so I am more than anyone eager to have a talented commander who can complete the tactics for you. He must be pure, have no power ambition, and will not compete with you for the greatest victory, so that in the next half century, The glory of the imperial military can belong to us Pompeii. Rommel is the best candidate, but unfortunately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
