			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underground members of the poems who are qualified to witness the battle screen are out of the castle in three batches. The first batch is Augustine holding the Titan Longan, and behind him is a grip. A gold-colored spear, a blond braid with a mask in his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin drilled the ground back to the hall where "The Madonna" was painted, and said: "Elizabeth said that there are two groups of enemies breaking into the Black Swan Lake, which is very powerful. The goal is also very clear, that is, the poetry brother castle and the Knights station, you go to save the Knights, I am at the gate of the castle, if you can not support will signal you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Aris nodded and pulled out the pure white mask, the glaring white, the two eyes that were vacant were extra dark, full of gloomy old Gothic style, the teenager put the mask on the face On the last cover, the blonde flutters like a mask. It is like a deep abyss with a delicious sacrifice to restore life. It not only encroaches on the face of the mysterious teenager, the neck, the body under the clothes, the limbs, but also a sacred and unclean A kind of contradictory atmosphere is struggling and seems to be competing for the right to use the soul of Ares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you have seen it 7 times, it is still scary every time." Augustine looked at the silhouette of a great knight. ,self-mumbling. The name of the mask is a vocabulary that is no stranger to the members of the sacrament, redemption, but the redemption of the Inquisition is only the punishment and salvation of the heresy by the giants. One of the three great sacred objects of the lecch race on the scorpion boy is God to the once dark king. The collective salvation, Lecch has 13 races, and the Redemption Mask has been preserved for the millennium for the only remaining Byron vamper, the "God's Shoemaker", a mask and another sacred object in a racial civil war more than 300 years ago. Lost together, and the Prince Augustine servant Dimit was also imprisoned in the cursing plan that the Papal Hall planned. It was the most powerful and best-race race in the longevity, completely dying in himself. The betrayal and strangulation of the great allies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Augustine is not aware of the true identity of Ares, the youngster of the nephew has lived in Rothschild’s manor since childhood, the only adopter of the wolf He also committed suicide with a secret. When he left the manor and set off the Gugli, he could go to his appointment. It was only Augustine’s good faith lie, but after 5 years, Ares wore a redemption mask and entered the night watcher’s branch. In the town of Tevin, the 3rd instructor of the night watch, Earl of Wilde, personally took the shot and stopped him. At that moment, Augustine realized that any miracle could appear in this young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knocked down Gugli Gree, of course, it does not mean that he defeated the sixth knight who challenged the five great knights of the empire, but at least the top singer of the sable flower, Gu Lige, told Augustine in a way that Ares is already qualified. From now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aris was thrown into the confession church after being wounded by Earl of Wilde, and finally the Teutonic giant personally interrogated Ares in the most mysterious holy place of the night watchman. The Holy See’s prestige was second only to the old man and the sacred spear who brought the boy out of the confession church. The young man had a gold-colored spear. In the face of Augustine’s doubts, the old man touched the boy’s head and said In a word, "This spear is a gift from the old guy to Ares, because he said that he is sympathetic to the two families of the child. Augustine, waiting for you to help the child find the "Taiwanese empire" The grandiose of Odin can complete the complete possession of the God of War. When I think of it, twelve arrogant people who think they can climb the ground from the ground up with the support of the Pope's Hall will be shocked."<br /><br />&nbsp; Augustine stood at the door of the castle of Poetry, and smiled bitterly: "Odin is a big man, that is the core equipment of the Titan Empire. If you want to kneel down, you can't even do the princes of Otis. ,dry Let me go to a good butcher Jonathan Dragon a dragon "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; soon, Augustine felt an majestic nuclear Fa fluctuations oncoming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convergence distracting, Augustine inserted Titan longan into the pulse point of his foot, pulled the red glove on his left hand, ready to meet a long-lost bloody battle. Lori Housekeeper gave the black back cover to Augustus very much, of course, which required Master Augustine to give 10 Caesar gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second batch is Elizabeth and Hera, who love to join in the fun. Before leaving the poem, Elizabeth did make a deal with the Saxon female heresy, Loli The butler untied the knight seal on Hera with a gamma that exceeded the epic continental average for 30 years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Elizabeth, is the first wave of enemies in the Black Swan Lake?" Hera walked in a spiral staircase leading to the ground and asked softly After the press, she found that she had a level of 9 knights, far beyond the expectations of the 7th level. Only one step she could re-enter the big knight threshold, but the 9th level knight even looks like the 10th level. The big knight also has a huge gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is the first flies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth nodded and said with a slight sigh. "I thought that the imperial powers would symbolize the warmth of my little Augustine. I didn't expect to play the main show directly. It is estimated that there are great people who are under pressure, otherwise any one. The imperial aristocrats couldn't mobilize six tulip magicians and four great arcans in one breath, and the top-grade singer-level spell costumes, seven armed and magnificent knights, are all slap-up Caesar gold coins. But wait for the most Augustine The headache is that I have added two alchemists and a sergeant who can't even guess the bottom line."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did you know?" Hera Curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell you too, how about making another deal?" Miss Elizabeth turned and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Hera, who has signed a contract that is more sloppy than the "selling deed", said: "That is still."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the little white cockroach that grows four mysterious little claws is lazy on Elizabeth's shoulders. Elizabeth sometimes stretches out her fingers to tease the little pets, and the two under the arm make her not very good. Comfortable Holy See classics, all species of the Muse continent and dark creatures like the Dark Sorcerer, the Little Gamma Warlock, the Necromancer, or the Lecch are naturally repulsive and fearful of theological books, but if you can successfully keep the poems The castle, that means that nearly 20 high-end toys can be left to her at will, and this is unpleasant and can easily be tolerated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Augustin really wants to be alone in the gate of the castle of the poetry brother?" Hera asked in a complicated mood, the palm of her hand was full of sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 great knights in the peak state, more than 10 powerful mage equipped with a complete set of songs, even if divided into two batches, it is not a normal person dare to go The horror of terror exists. She now finally understands how the young archon is faced with the level of imperial enemies. Hera clenches her fists and follows Hera out of the ground and heads straight to the top floor of the poetry castle. She wants to open the mystery and darkness. In the end, the degree of strength of the official, walking on the corner of the 2nd floor, she could not help but ask the little song of Elizabeth: "Don't you worry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I can't win, I don't know, but Augustine won't die, otherwise he will run away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth laughs, just smiles are not as easy as usual "There is a reason to take you to the top floor. After I hand over the "Ivan Grand Code" and "Noah Theology Collection" to you, I will give you this gold. When you see the situation, you will lose it. Of course, don't let go of it, it will make Augustine collapse. After I take you on, I will go to the little scorpion to watch the movie. By the way, I have no chance to slay one or two big knights, and then come out. Two skeleton knights, let the stupid nerds of the flock of horns know What is efficiency and quality.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Elizabeth arrived at the top floor, she kindly reminded: "Augustin is a chauvinous pig. Don't mess with him when you don't need to intervene. One day your goddess sister will understand that he is a cute little guy. Seemingly sincere, in fact, hypocritical, seemingly pious, in fact, arrogant, seemingly fearless, but timid, but at least there is a bad habit that most nobles of the empire are cast aside, will not discard the person he really cares, even if this person will only give him Bringing endless troubles like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I?" Hera was confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it not?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth squinted at a ignorant woman, without feelings "The practice of minimizing the risk of maximizing order benefits should be the Helen family who took the corpse of the big knight Descartes and then returned you to the sissy but quite vengeful. This is the versatile technique of the nobility. You really thought A double professional master is even scarcer than the Imperial Princess? Not to mention me, Augustine himself is a madman who majors in all nine major occupations of the empire. Do you think you can withstand the impact of several big knights? Two, three? Well, at most you four. Then, the order has no reason to establish Helen and the Savior. The two will definitely shoot the enemy. Is Augustin arrogant enough to think that the enemy is not enough? After all, it is the odious sensibility he always sneered at. For this, because this guy thinks you are one of the few poor worms in the empire, he must be like I first reached out to help him, helping a self-believing in Saxon’s high self-feeling. Good vase. You should be lucky enough to meet a rare man whose godfather is a saint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera pale, his eyes suddenly glow, and he said: "As long as I have made enough contributions to Rothschild and the order to prove that Augustine is not only a sentimental gambler, but also a successful gambler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Elizabeth snorted and said: "A noble madman encounters a heretical neuropathy, praises you, the omniscient shaman emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The classics and the golden dragonfly fed by the saliva of Vulcan handed it to Hera. She leaped to the direction of Swan Lake behind the castle. She screamed and jumped from the top of the castle, shouting: "Food, greatness. Elizabeth's big shaman is coming!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last batch is the researcher of the horns laboratory and the professor of Shirley, who followed them in accordance with Augustin in detail. Asked to make the undead, made many modifications, many details The face has gone beyond the knowledge of the shofar. As a result, two 6-level knights have created two undead knights who are close to the peak of the 9th-level power. There is a law in the field of martial arts and undead books. The lower the body level, the bones and the dead spirits produced. The more vulnerable, the less jump upgrades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So once you are lucky enough to get a complete sacred knight and can successfully tame it, it is definitely a miracle worthy of all the heresy. There are a total of 17 sacred knights in the history of the road. Poisoned hands, and every piece of darkness has set off a large area of ​​blood on the epic continent. The most powerful one in the history of black magic is the gorse sacred knight "Sacred Ashoka", which was once worshipped by the Holy See The knight, regarded as the greatest warrior of that era, was made "a red Ashoka" by a large number of magical heresy geniuses. He even broke into the sacred and inviolable Pope's Hall, and twisted the four giants of the Pope's Hall into two. The head was finally destroyed by Pope Benedict III with the ban, that is, from then on, the two Holy Sees began to draw clear sacred and sin boundaries for the spells, Dark Arts, Undead, Little Gamma, Qishu is considered a taboo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the chief research officer and the chief professor in the shofar is a well-known fact. The two are silently out of the ground, behind them are two made from the knight The embarrassment, because the body has been killed before being thrown into the horn by Ares, so it affects the strength of the undead, to a considerable extent. Otherwise, jumping to level 4 to become a great knight will be a major breakthrough for the horn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think we will die, Miss Yu Yi?" Professor Shirley, who is very popular, chuckled and broke the silence. Her voice is always flattering, mature and feminine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young person in charge of controlling the horns now has no answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you die first, I will definitely make you a very delicate doll that can sell for a big price." Professor Shirley covered her mouth. Smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you climb the bed of the big executive, let me say, but I don't think anyone wants to taste a peach that is already cooked." Dao, she doesn't have a lot of words, and occasionally her mouth is incomparably bitter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s all ripe to get a bite." Professor Shirley still smiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "boring, no man, will you die?" Yi Yi sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Professor Shirley smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"婊子." 腓I squinted, and there was a rare murder hidden behind the bangs and heavy frames. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
