			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of Maso County, the little villain in the castle of Poetry, even if he has money, is just a nouveau riche, even farther than Greenspan. Far from it, Augustine also had this kind of consciousness, so when Miss Alice's luxury carriage passed the Black Swan Lake, she invited him to participate in the banquet of the forest villa, and did not take the tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poetry brother has a few carriages, the best one is the big red carriage sent by the French orange boss Marseille, but the reputation is not good. The main taste of Alpha City is really bad. The carriage is tossed by him. It is nothing but extravagant and extravagant. It is not as good as the barbarian family. And he is attending the banquet as a private magician of Miss Alice today. It is not a rule to ride a carriage. The triumphant knight or the romantic bard, accepting the kindness of a lady, and placing it in any city on the epic continent, is not a shame, but a beautiful talk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice’s costume is a masterpiece of an old court tailor in the Imperial City. The old housekeeper Asa and the Greenspan family magic teacher, Old Carver, praised her as a barbarian. The pearl on the crown is not a noble-style guest. With their age and status, they have long passed the passionate days of lying down and sleeping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice's skin is fair, such as a string of rare black pearls around the neck of the swan neck, full of round, about this string of valuable pearls, in the emperor Arousing a sensation, the barbarians and the sissy Helen two empire newcomers launched a round of fierce auctions on the auction floor. The sissy showed a rare toughness, and the two almost went to the point of rushing on the spot, and finally they were present. The old good man, the Marquis of Caroling, came forward to mediate. This is not the case. The two families are still negotiating behind the scenes. The black pearl necklace named "The Seal of the Sea Devil" was taken away by Greenspan. So many imperial salons are rumored to be Helen. The first heir to the protection of the banking industry, I want to express my love for the Rudolph family's housekeeper Ekaterina, so the tears of the Kraken are inevitable. Unfortunately, the result was evaluated as a gold coin lost to a spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was on the way to look at the private magic teacher sitting next to her, her eyes shattered, not arrogant, heard when chatting with Aunt Quentin Interesting things, don't dare to laugh as usual, even if the man sitting next to tell her "go to his nobles", Alice thinks that the first sentence of the ladies' manual page "30-year-old beauty sluts also want It’s reasonable to bow to a 60-year-old lady. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today Augustine put on a brand new robe, still can't find the priestly class, this kind of robes originally had three sets, he walked out of the Pontiac Monastery In addition to a handwritten "teaching", the heart of two saints, there are only three sets of linen robes from the hand workshop, simple, durable, and there is no carving on the robe. The first set of teaching robes was repaired in Augustin's red gloves stage of the night watchman. Finally, in the bloody battle of the "Kepler Gallows" on the border of the white roses, it was completely scrapped. Augustine's "butcher" "the reddest red" Gloves and other names are from the bloody battle. I am afraid that all heretics can't think of the unprovoked madness of the young scorpion monk. A large part of the reason is only the destruction of his robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with Mrs. Quentin’s discerning eyes, Augustine is also a handsome man with a long-sleeved body, but not weak, ten-finger, maybe the only young lady who can only know the outside world through court poetry and salon hymns. At the same time, facing Augustine, and Constantine, one of the Augers Gemini stars, will fall in love with the latter at first sight, and then abandon the former with a little regret, but the experienced Mrs. Quentin is different, and the appearance is too aggressive. Sexual men are not suitable for the appetite of such mature women. The ladies like it is not a creamy face, but the knight's strong body, or the poet's temperament. Mrs. Quentin often conceived maliciously. How can the governor not go to the curve of the nobles to save the country, she believes that he will be very popular, can be compared with the autobiography of the Titan Empire, the flower and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bliss Bird Forest Villa is magnificent and famous. There are two things, hot springs and white deer. The mountain foot villa has a large bath and a row of eight lion heads. The hot water is constantly flowing all the year round, and the water mist is lingering. The good ladies who are privately married to the Conti County and the Condit family are proud to be able to come to the bath. But the real deer bird villa is still known as the White Deer. It is said that an imperial emperor visited the Condid family more than 300 years ago. When he was hunting in the forest, he encountered a white deer. The white deer opened his mouth and said this sentence is now very popular. "Don't touch me, I belong to Caesar." Caesar, the Caesar on the Caesar gold coin, was the founder of the Holy Empire. The Emperor of the Empire was very excited and began to appeal to the Condit family. However, the Condit family never changed the Bliss Villa to the White Deer. villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the innocent, simple Alice asked about this allusion, Mrs. Quentin could not give a definitive answer, and Augustine was from a source more than Condit The deep family, in his manor that has now been deprived of inheritance, has a similar story, except that the protagonist is replaced by another emperor and a female elf, so Augustine just calmly told Alice that it was a beautiful lie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice, as the representative of Greenspan, needs to deal with a lot of tedious things. The faithfulness of Greenspan’s lord is destined to be a family of heirs. The Earl of Germain and his wife gave birth to three men and a woman, three male heirs in the Titan battlefield on the southern border, the Saxon forest in the southeast and In the Western Capricorns, the warfare was harvested, and the war madness was the only one. The youngest daughter, Miss Alice, was most like a normal aristocratic heir. So the Earl of Germans always likes to bring a little daughter, and Miss Alice occasionally plays the role of a family diplomat. They are all excellent, so she is undoubtedly the most favorite flower of the barbarians. The most terrible thing is that her three brothers have been famous for her, and she has reached the point of deformity. Jupiter is surrounded by a sword because she is close to Alice. The unlucky ones are endless, and if the good guys start betting, can Alice escape the "claws" of his brothers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Augustin, are you a desire for Alice, or love?" Mrs. Quentin, as the latest lame diplomat at the Poetry Castle, will of course follow Augustine. Her makeup is very ordinary, and it is no different from the general lady of Maso County. The only thing that is uncoordinated is that her chest is covered with a high round neck. It is difficult to reveal a large area of ​​smooth and tender scenery. With the scale of her chest, she can definitely Hold up a seductive deep ditch, but unfortunately, the unreasonable order is long. Your words are: Mrs. Quentin, you don’t expect to wear a low collar at the dinner party in your life. In this regard, Mrs. Quentin only symbolically resisted one or two sentences, there is no following. And it seems that Mrs. Quentin, who has come all the way to make countless old nobles feel that her clothes are too conservative, is not lost. Walking around Augustine, she asked a very serious question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine did not answer this question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you deal with Alice's three brothers?" Mrs. Quentin did not give up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine still refuses to answer, he feels that it is more practical to spend time thinking about some more in-depth questions. Don't expect a madman who dares to provoke the Todd family to tease the Condit family. He will know how to be modest, not to mention the three aristocratic knights with strange love views. After dealing with heresy for a long time, Augustine has long been accustomed to the aristocratic etiquette. Next, go to a spear longer than one, and whose fist is harder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dinner party, the castle is full of meticulous nobles everywhere, the landlord with oily faces, the greedy banker, the bishop of the robe I can't wait for the knights with the medals on the chest, the clothes are going to be more bloated than the body, the "hardworking" lady, the unmarried ladies who have been watching and hunting, and some of the artist poets who boast eyeballs, in the impression of Augustine, Whether it is the Duke of Luotong Chad, or the neighboring residence of the Prince of Australia, they refused all similar banquets. Augustine’s family was serene, while the next door was cold, but both subconsciously refused vulgarity and embarrassment. Mrs. Quentin saw him standing beside a bookshelf on the periphery of a circle, not disturbing, taking a book from the bookshelf, and preparing a lot of reading works at the Villa of Lele, giving the ladies some exquisite collections of poems. The latest works of mainland literary writers who are eloquent and grand narratives are offered to nobles and gentlemen, giving them a high-sounding inspiration. Mrs. Augustine and Mrs. Quentin are in front of a circle of loan-savvy speculators and bankers. They are all topics that are derived from money. Of course, they are full of superiority, and they feel witty and witty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
