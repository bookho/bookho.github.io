			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private magic teacher of the Beffin family can’t conceal his disbelief. He can also summon this frosty dragon, but don’t forget, he is How old is old, his now respectable and enviable reverence status is countless times of difficult assessments and countless wonderful papers piled up, how many times buried in the yellow book, tired and extremely up-to-earth will ask if you can give up, but They have all been rejected by the heart, and this has come to this day, becoming a respected elder, not just a mediocre aristocrat with a family title. Which of the knights who have been sweating on the battlefield, who is the magician who won the crown, is not proud of this simplest honor? In the bottom of my heart, the old tulip magician has no good feelings for Miss Bohemian who does not pay a little bit but enjoys the rich greenhouse flowers. But in any corner of the empire, it is basic common sense to have a good relationship with the nobility, let alone Baffin. Can this be a family of gold subspecies even if it is not a dragon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader of the Academic Affairs Section of St. Carroll College is even more overwhelmed because the public inside the college prohibits all magical skills, so Saint-Carroll has been for many years. I have never seen such a dazzling high-level magic outside, but it is even more difficult to understand with normal thinking that the ordinary monk in front of me is not wearing a uniform torch uniform, and he determined that the rare number of torches are absolutely not young. A place for people, even if it is the genius in the genius, in the torch, he only likes to stay in the secluded library on the top floor to read the banned book of Gaga, he has seen several times. The man who does not rely on a large number of precious "hot springs" to bless the nuclear scorpion, but easily makes the magician defined as the 63-level ice dragon in the official magic book, who is it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is the glory of the empire, it is a day of enrollment, and a large number of freshmen who have not been riddled by the college and have an idle character like to browse a college more like a palace garden. When they looked up and saw the ice dragon that was dozens of meters long, they all stretched their necks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A student is full of classrooms with crowded corridors, and an expressionless middle-aged man stands under the blackboard, teaching a paper, "Discussing the moral misunderstanding of the Dark Arts", not long ago, he recognized that the boring and innocent classroom has been sparsely populated, and few students are busy dozing off, they just want to find a quiet place to rest. The man's face is pale, his fingers are slender, and a strong local accent is definitely not a middle-aged person who can give a good impression. His expression is stiff and his words are dull. Far from some noble professors of old qualifications come and live vividly. His lectures don't like to interact with the audience, but they are allowed to interrupt the process by the students. Before, no one has this interest. Now no one has this courage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the spectacular scene built by magic appeared outside the window, there was a burst of exclamation and scream inside and outside the classroom. The middle-aged professor was still indifferent and continued to lecture. His lecture content was basic and different, and it was difficult for the elite of the Empire who qualified to enter St. Gallore. In the harvest, the new red man of the emperor has few friends who can speak, and there is no lover who is consistent with his identity. There is no big family operation and support behind it, and there is very little relationship with his peers. He seems to be alone forever. The bell made by St. Carroll's magical plant crystal squirrel rocking, the professor closed the handout, said the class, looked at the dense text on the blackboard, and suddenly turned and asked: "Who wants to ask questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one responded, half because he was anxious to appreciate the artificial landscape that was rarely seen outside the window. Half of the professor’s course was really boring. The man did not show regret and loss. He left the classroom with a handout of lectures and was ready to return to the shabby residence in the streets of Da Lv Tong. There were many magical propositions on the desk there that he needed to stay up late to solve. All his fun is devoted to the almost never-ending field of magic, which has never been given to the noble life that the aristocrats are used to. Whether it is the Oak District or the Dalhou Street where Morgan Knights College is located, it is a civilian area of ​​Jupiter City. Every nobleman of the Imperial City knows that Morgan Knights College in St. Carroll and Dayan Street in the Oak District is A pair of enemies, because the Imperial First Class Medal is the Iron Oak Medal, so that there are still old-fashioned magicians who apply to the Minister of the Interior to change the reputation of the Oak District, and as the most pure military family of the lineage, let the heirs behind the line Simia chose magic instead of the female knight instructor. There was a fierce controversy within the family, but she was born with a nuclear capacity better than ordinary people, which forced her father to accept the reality, but hired a family magic teacher. It was not arrogant, and this was originally a grand event in the ordinary family. For this reason, the Marquis had to privately compensate the tulip magician for the tulip magician old Luxembourg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What really delights the Buffin family is that their alternative celebrities are seen by St. Carroll’s strangest professors, due to a hosted by Old Luxembourg last year. The small-scale senior magician party, there was a silent middle-aged professor who was hired from the Imperial Eastern Province of the Magic Union in the last two years, and the magic apprentice Bohemian as a bystander presented a " at the party." "The magic is what" naive problem, many magic teachers laughed, but the civilian professor who climbed to the throne of the vice president of the county magic union in a few years but was immediately beaten back to the original form, but seriously answered this sounds Very naive question, it took an hour to complete, and even the questioner was a little sleepy. This is a strange guy. After the episode, she and the old Luxembourg did not care. It was only when the black aster flower that had a certain friendship with the middle-aged professor in the torch became the pride of the empire, and the professor who was the best in the countdown at St. Carlos College, was promoted to become the vice president of the college. At the beginning, the aristocrats who had studied in Santa Barol were scorned. A civilian professor who did not have a black orchid badge could enter the college as the apex and become one of the six vice presidents. This joke is so funny. But it turned out that it was not a joke, but a serious fact. With the departure of Gaka, after the great sages and great knights of the empire arrived at the edge of the Mayan Snow Mountain, they returned to the Imperial Capital, and the order was officially issued. Long personally written, signed by the Prime Minister of the Empire. On the same day, the owner of Beffin took the daughter of Caper to the new vice president in a small room in the civilian area, and volunteered to change the professor to a bright and spacious new home, but the latter refused directly, but fortunately did not refuse to be the Befen family. The only future magician makes up the class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is Takko from Augsburg, a theoretical magician known for his study of heresy. His resume is very simple. He was a deputy dean of a singularity in a public school with a handful of nobles but a crowd of civilians. He was later hired by the Rotong Chaid family and then quickly accepted by the magic unions who knew it. And became the vice president of the county guild. Later, with the dying of the aster flower, he was kicked out of the guild by a savvy person who was more fickle than a woman because of the vague reason of "getting too much into the dark theory." The letter of introduction recommended to enter St. Carroll, and the relationship with Gaga is good. Occasionally, some magic problems will be discussed. This is the thin resume of Professor Taco, the seventh largest figure in the highest school of imperial magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly walked out of the classroom, and his pace was generally boring with his life style, and he was greeted by countless aristocratic students and Saint-Carroll leaders along the way. He never makes any response. Leaving the Suge Building, the main building of the college, I finally looked up and saw that the ice dragon that he unexpectedly did not become dissipated due to the weakening of the nuclear support, the middle-aged professor screamed, the tulip magician would never take himself. Decades of hard-working badges and prestige to create such gimmicks, the torch members are strictly prohibited in the Berlin Park, even a single out of the need to go through layers of approval, let alone play San Carlo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noble child who is not afraid of the authority of St. Gallor and willing to spend a lot of "hot springs"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the youngest deputy in the history of the college saw the perpetrators, the pale face that was rated as the "hardest marble floor" emerged Nearly terrible fanaticism, similar to the pagans who saw the gods in their minds, he stepped up his pace, and when he saw several old college supervisors preparing to impose sanctions on the young man wearing a robe, the middle-aged professor was angry and nervous. For the first time, he used the power of the vice president, but in a very unfamiliar way, he directly dropped the book to the supervisor and shouted: "Stop!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The old supervisors looked at each other and did not know what the vice president’s adult had taken the wrong medicine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Bohemia saw the vice-president and immediately smiled. Hey, she appeared in the most close-knit big man in the college. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than a decade, the same uninteresting Taco, Augustine smiled, did not immediately revoke the control of the Frost Dragon, let it Falling into the ground, but let the water dragon return to the fountain, this scene, in the eyes of St. Carroll students, is simply a miracle, which requires a more unreasonable and accurate calculation of the nuclear, is tantamount to a grand independent Engineering, in the difficult high-level magic class, the old magician will talk to the younger generations. In general, magic is a mysterious product with strong inertia. This is the god's favor for the magician, but once the magic is to be recycled, this It is roughly equivalent to rejecting the gift of the gods, and needs to double the ability to resist the "punishment" of the three golden rules of magic. Taco’s deputy dean almost ran to the eyes of young priests. The ceremony was respectful: “Master Augustine, I finally saw you, and forgive Taco’s inaction for years.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Of course, Augustine saw Taco throwing books and jokingly said: "How, my second private magic teacher, the sable badge was also lost by you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taco shook his head and said: "It has always been treasured, I just feel that I don't deserve to wear her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled and said: "Like you are my first Once taken to Taylor Street in the Tabor district of Augsburg, I feel that my parents should not go out to meet you personally?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taco sighs heavily:" That was the most touching moment in Taco's life, not because of your parents' noble status, but because of their love for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine is not a word . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taco, who is not good at talking, doesn’t know how to speak. The young Master Augustine went to the Ola Theological Seminary at the age of thirteen, and for a dozen years, Master Augustine really grew up, at least he must be taller than himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Calor students who flocked to watch after class are all guessing the identity of the monk, and are preparing to show up with the Taco Associated Academy under the eyes of the public. Miss Bohemia, who has a good relationship, is at a loss. The guy who spoke for the two hens in Richelieu Province is a friend of the vice president? But will friends be so humble from the heart? She has the arrogance and conceit that the family has given her, but again, it is not stupid. The education of an ancient family has made every intelligent heir to be good at observing. How to do? The embarrassed Miss Bohemian sought help from the old Luxembourg around him, hoping that he would come forward to clean up this abominable absurd situation. But the old magician looked terrified. Master Augustine? Can Tacco, who is born in the city of Augsburg, be so awesome, will there be a second Augustine? I actually questioned whether the fourth chief executive of a sacrament is qualified to hold an sorcerer's magic wand? Even if this alone, let the Emperor's Grizzly gambling market to earn nearly 10 million Caesar gold coins, the most unpopular person holding three four epic magic wands, who is going to take this irrelevant little thing to face up and challenge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street of the Oak District outside the college gate roared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fancy knights at Morgan College are practicing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is no. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen of the great knights wearing the highest-ranking Miland-style armor of the empire directly rushed into the gates of St. Carroll, rushing all the way to the square under the stairs of the Su Ge building, wearing a dazzling array of luxury medals for the first knight's chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a bastard family that has been cursed by countless aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more brutal than the Greenspan family and more embarrassing than any family in the Imperial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Kraft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One was born the second empire of the empire, and there was a leisurely ran to go to the Ola Theological Seminary for more than ten years and then swayed back to the emperor to continue to ridicule The old master of the lady, this is really a shit family, but all the families have to lick their noses to praise this big dog on the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the knight is the son of the old Kraft homeowner, the big dragon gun knight house Dawei, one who had privately led in the peacetime, from the knight serious violation of the military law into the Titan In the empire, and picking up a string of big knights head hanging on the spear back to Jupiter City's crazy madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was thus removed from several empire honor badges, but soon in the regular battle, all win back, re-hanging on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the best soldier in the empire that ravages the blood of the Kraft family. The only shortcoming is that he fears his wife. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all the people who are almost in the same place where the old lion Kraft’s owner is not present in the emperor’s family ownership, no one wants to face the favorite Octavian, who had dealt with the head of the dead, once he attended a grand celebration party. He was bored and he only managed to solve a whole roast peacock. A good old man who wanted to close the old prince exchanged an old man, you can have this neck. Can not afford to cut a sword." I was scared that the old count was seriously ill after returning, and almost didn't get out of bed. It was such a knight who had not been able to become a general because of the imperial law. He broke into St. Carroll, turned over and saw the young priest standing next to the vice president of Taco, laughing and stepping up the ladder. I’ve got through, “Little Augustine, Jupiter City, where you are, I’m going to ruin me. I heard that your carriage entered the Oak District, but I crossed over a dozen streets and walked. Our little Clough misses you. When the baptism is over, we will go to Jonathan to have some fun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
