			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most infamous Earl's Mansion in the imperial capital of Krafu is located in the Potsdamer district in the north of Jupiter, where many old and powerful families are gathered, such as the barbarians. Can not settle in, can only stay in the emerging Suna district, in the words of the old master of Clough, that a stinking fart in Potsdam is better than a feast of Suna. At this time, a team wearing a Milan-style sly squatted from the Cavaliers across Suana and went straight to Potsdam. There were countless young ladies who screamed and rushed to the balcony to scatter flowers. Most of them symbolize the eternal love in the empire. The flower orchids were thrown to the big dragon gun knight alongside a shabby knight, the most alternative hero of the empire, Octavian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The phoenix fern, you have always been very popular in the emperor." Augustine, who was riding a wand in Haize pure blood, laughed, "Feng The tail fern is the nickname he gave to Octavian. This plant only survives on the icy wasteland of the northernmost land. It has a strong vitality. Once it gets a little bit of sunshine, it can rise from the gap of the ice and bloom. It’s wild, so Octavian likes this nickname. The most appreciative role of the Kraft heir who has both the blood of the enemy and the delicate virtues of the two women is the professor of literature. His wife, originally a royal librarian, was not equipped with the ultimate absurdity. Marriage, caused a lot of sensation in the emperor, but for so many years, even in the long years of the big dragon gun knights away from the emperor to the battlefield, there has been no peach-colored anecdote about him, this is probably the lady of the emperor’s lady who is particularly favored by him. The reason, which woman does not want to have such a husband who can bring a great sense of security? The bed is fierce, the loyalty under the bed, the heroic killing of the enemy on the horse, how singular, is a living poem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A big face with a beard and a big smile, even a little embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not worry, I will not tell Mrs. Richmond your luck in the Suna area." Augustine snarled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Da Dawei is obviously relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kraft family’s private homes are not very stylish, and the scale is far less than the private courtyards of some wealthy families in the suburbs. The interior decoration is old and old-fashioned. Hundreds of years of unchanging decoration style. In the past few years, it was not easy to inject a fresh style that was praised by the imperial parties. However, after an old man regained power, he disappeared immediately. In short, this is a family that is recognized as an aesthetic deformity. When Augustine dismissed, the number of people who greeted him was sparse, and there were three, old, small, female, very weird combinations, no great ornate, but I believe that every Potsdam resident does not question the Kraft family today. The guest's special attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man who smiled was Old Clough, the most legendary Earl of the Empire. He is holding a little grandson who just learned to walk, standing next to a woman with a face and indifference. Her feelings are completely out of touch with the feminine beauty. The slender figure is revealing the cold temperament of the eagle. It is a rare thing that has been immersed in the top of the food chain for a long time in the aristocratic circle. It is hard to imagine that this small woman who has just reached 160 cm in height has tamed the Dalong Gun Knight House. Augustine stepped forward and bent over to look at the little boy who was very special because of her inheritance of significant family traits. The child stood with a still tender and determined look, and his eyes were not as savvy as the average child. The identity of a stranger, the future godfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled, reached out and touched Little Clough’s head, and then took a sacred triangle necklace from the neck that was blessed by several priests. He personally hangs on the child's neck. The old Claf, who had a small eye, laughed and smashed into a slit. For this private priest, he has always been ignorant of his own good mood. The mother of the child, the wife of Richmond, a bloodthirsty lion, was able to see this silent harmony scene, and the corner of her mouth was slightly raised. In some ways, this priest is her potential enemy. But at least as a mother, she hopes her child has a godfather who is knowledgeable and will not be pedantic. Octavian has been stupid in anyway. A group of people entered the Earl's House and went to the family church. The process of baptism was not cumbersome. It was no different from the civilian family. It was arranged for water worship, and the water immersion ceremony was exempted. Augustine used his finger to drown the water on the forehead of Little Kraft. Simple and solemn. At the end of the baptism, Augustine pulled up the hands of the new godson and came to the crucifix. He whispered: "Little Kraft, no matter what path you choose, you don't have to pray frequently on courtesy, but be sure to do it every time. Prayer is all sincerity, because those who love to stand in church or at the intersection and pray loudly and deliberately let people hear will not receive the gift of the Lord. Their oily tone, even if the voice is thunderous, will never be acceptable to the Lord." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the two-year-old child able to understand, some look at the mother awkwardly, Augustine smiled: "It doesn't matter, I am not as big as you are, nor Understand this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Richmond smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food on the long table is simple and simple, and rough, the only remaining advantage is to be full. Not worth a few bourbon silver coins. In this era of aristocratic preferences from the distant regions, Claf maintained a few original family traditions. There is only one lesson in this family: the best food is the enemy. The head and blood, the best lover, is the rifle and sword in the hand. Octavian especially likes to see his little friend Augustine eating as much as he is, not like the sissy attitude of the weak aristocrats at those boring banquets. There weren't many words on the table, and Little Clough had been curious and curious to see the godfather beside him. Mrs. Richmond’s gaze never intersected the old Clough. Octavian is busy eating, drinking a big mouth, eating meat, and occasionally his wife will use a napkin to wipe the rough corner of the wine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the dinner, Augustine and the old Clough came to the dimly lit study. This large study was not as large as the general aristocrats. It was a huge book that had never been read in a lifetime. The bookshelf was small, and only the genealogy and genealogy were placed. The personal biography of the owner, as a family of more than 20 real-powered generals and countless honoured knights, these books, there are few wind and snow and red wine banquets, the current Emperor’s Majesty once spent a whole day reading it, feeling This is a complete history of imperial war. The emperor even promised to arrange the most beautiful court poet of the empire to write a biography for the old master, but the old man politely and resolutely refused because he had chosen to write two personal biographies for him and Octavian. The guy who made this honor is standing in the study at the moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploring several belief issues. Old Kraft rolled up the tobacco and ignited, watching the private priest and said: "It seems that the Emperor Majesty has some dissatisfaction with you recently. Well, I think it is not just dissatisfaction, but annoyed. Augustine, what have you done? What?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled bitterly: “Kill the son of the lion king Todd’s Marquis? Annoyed the Cono family of the fraternal father of Maso County? Or sneak up to create the undead Legion? I have been thinking about this problem on my way. From the Senate, I sent a trial group that would only eat, drink, and play to test the poems. I knew that it was just a prelude to the paralyzed order. The real feast. I am afraid that the chef is still the chief secretary of state. The Marquis of Todd and the Condid family are inevitably ignited, but I am puzzled by the key points that can make the emperor angry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Old Clarke spit out a smoke circle. Because of the cheap tobacco, the smell of smoke is not good, and even some noses, the old man frowned and said: "Are you too close to the barbarian?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shook his head and said: "I just walked closer to Miss Alice of Greenspan, but it didn't make the palace feel jealous."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Kraft tempted and asked: "Augustin, you confess with me, are there any major secrets that you can't say? Then you are caught by the mind?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin laughed: "Yes, of course, who doesn't have one or two secrets? But I don't think it will hurt the empire."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Clough oh, nodded and agreed. The friendship between him and the private priest in the dynasty of the Vedah Monastery has always been irrelevant, and this is a very rare and friendly relationship in the long life of the elderly. So the old man trusts this young but profound priest. Old Clough has every reason to believe that a young man who can let the godfather give up the priest's scepter to protect him. It is worthy of him to pay some elders' love, such as finding an excuse to send one. Spend money and donate a hundred and twenty seniors from the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study room door was gently pushed open to reveal a small head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin and the old Clough smiled at each other, the old man sitting in the chair quickly extinguished the cigarette, beckoning, hoarse voice, kindly, "Little Kraft, come "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child swayed to the old man and was held in his arms by the old count. In the Clough family, every child should learn to walk and run as soon as possible. If you fall, no one will help, because only in this way can you quickly learn to ride horses and hold spears in your youth, not afraid of hurting, and take pride in being scarred on any battlefield. Therefore, in the Clough family, there are very few children who fight and go to the parents to cry. Augustine did not stop the godson from observing his perseverance, pushing open the window, dispelling the smell of smoke, and sitting back to the position, he said: "Dauda is going to the southern border of the empire, this time if you can get an ivy badge and A tiger's tail medal, then he gathered the twenty-one war badges of the empire, the last one, dating back more than forty years ago."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The son of the most aggressive war on the mainland is already moving. After the death of Prince Titus, the number one enemy of the Titans, the arrogant Titan radicals all threatened that the sacred empire degenerated from the young to the baby overnight, and the Titan’s knight sword was completely free to slaughter. The sacred empire’s current border army leader is more suitable. The goose down bed waits for the husband, not against the most powerful knights on the epic continent. The lifelong enemies of Prince Odis, the Prince of Titan, the Prince of Titan, is even more abrupt. He clearly wants to crush the Titan's horseshoes on every inch of the sacred land. According to the number of Titan high-ranking officers captured by Caesars Gold, this indicates that this will be the largest war in the past two decades. The Titan will enter the six armies in an unprecedented battle, and the signs show that the millennium has been used for the epic continent. The Kami Kingdom, which is arduously guarding the North Gate, will be echoed, fighting the biggest barrier of the "climate" sacred empire at all costs, and then launching an offensive against the Holy Empire. But once, the Holy Empire did not panicly send the messengers who carried a lot of money to the place of the North to the solemn condemnation and the “gifts” under the table as they did 50 years ago. Jupiter’s silence remained almost conceited. In order to prepare for the two-line battle, it seems that the lowest-key king on the mainland tries to prove that the sacred empire 50 years later is no longer the country that survived in the cracks of fifty years ago and panicked. The generals inside the empire, especially the military upstarts that have risen in recent decades, are equally confident and ambitious. The priest Napoleon discovered the New World, the young witch of the torch broke the centennial record and was summoned by the Mayan temple, as well as the activeness of the bankers and the potential support for the war. Everything shows the prosperity and rise of the empire. Private talks are discussing when the sacred empire is Ace, which can get the apostle card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count smiled and said: "Those chest medals are less than poor generals will not give the opportunity to Octavian, unless he rushed to the front line at the cost of violating the military discipline."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine will smile. The woman’s beauty to her woman, the literati’s quill pens of other poets, and the generals, the badges that naturally hang on the chests of other warriors are not difficult to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man blinked: "I revealed to you a secret, Octavian has kept me secret, these twenty-one badges, he will only leave The family has an iron oak tree, and I will give you an Ivy as a gift for the adult vine. The rest will be given to you because he knows that you are a family crest and a war medal collector."<br /><br />&nbsp Augustin laughed and joked: "I knew this, at the St. Carroll Magic Academy, I should have tolerate his mouthfulness and behave more enthusiastically with him." It’s not a fist.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Clough waved his hand and said: “It’s okay, Octavian likes this friendship. This guy is not used to meeting. Just talk about the cumbersome etiquette of the best-selling poetry collection or the nobility gossip."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Grandpa, is the father going home to go to the battlefield?" Little Kraft looked sad. He is very clever and walks slowly, but reading and literacy is very fast, which may be inherited from his mother's strengths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count is somewhat unhappy, just want to teach a little family education, but was stopped by Augustine’s eyes, the latter smiled and explained: “Little Kraft, you want to be A knight?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child hesitated because the mother deliberately gave up the ceremonial officer but taught herself personally, making the new Kraft heir more longing. Become an elegant aristocrat, of course, so far the young children do not quite understand the meaning of the word elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old count gently cursed. The old man did not have a good impression on the daughter-in-law. It was not a dissatisfaction with her ordinary identity. Instead, she disliked the woman’s attempt to take charge of a military family, and even more damn is to want to turn Kraff into a literary family. . Augustine glanced at the old count of the swearing words, and the old man smiled and shut up. Augustine patiently said: "Little Kraft, when the godfather was a child, there was a desire to become a knight and be able to ride a dragon. Do you want to?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
