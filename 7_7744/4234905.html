			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Put the section that was owed yesterday to ~ps: The first time you contacted a Western fantasy friend, you may feel some headaches in the early stage, and you will definitely stick to tens of thousands of words. The problem is ~)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosperous and dirty slave trade and frequent underground banking transactions bring Alpha City vitality, the most direct result is to bring Alpha City closer With a resident population of 400,000, there are the most bloody and cruel slave traders here. There are the most treacherous bankers and a large number of gold rushers. There are a large number of industries and places that are derived from the aristocratic wealthy entertainment. The keen jewellery shop can always co-produce with the trend of the emperor. As long as you have money, you can buy pet shops with interesting creatures. Of course, there is no shortage of cheap salon clubs and brothels of all grades. There are all kinds of miniatures and counterfeit editions. Alpha can not change the pattern, the most important thing is that the emperor has countless old-fashioned priests and prosecutors, but there is only one count of Marseille, the city owner who only recognizes the money and does not recognize the law. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big banker of Alpha’s investment in the black auction house, McDowell, spoke at a private banquet and said: You have 100,000 Caesar coins. You are a friend of Count Marseille. You have a million, then you are the son of the Earl of Marseille. If you accidentally have 10 million, congratulations, you are already the oldest son of Marseille. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin’s unlicensed pony trek in the snobbish Alpha City tragedy can only be carried on the sidelines. In the past, the most favorite of the most popular Elizabeth’s 100,000 I am not happy, but she is just a small butler who hopes that all the wealth growth will be hoped for a shabby priest. She has to roll up and down in the carriage, screaming for Augustine to go to Dreux and let him go to the robbery. A banker full of fat, Augustine lazy to ignore her intermittent "female madness", lazy driving a dilapidated carriage, admiring Alpha's urban planning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpha has three large markets, two of which are black markets, and the underground market in the northern part of the city known as the Raven Market sells a variety of improper channels. Articles, the slave market in the west of the city, nicknamed "Lolita", comes from a collection of poems. Augustine is now going to the crow market, reaching the market outside the crowd, and the carriage is managed to the professional carriage management office, 5 hours and 100 copper plates. Augustine squinted at the price list and found that the luxury carriages of the size of the Greenspan family were at least one hour of Bourbon silver coins, and of course the horses would receive VIP treatment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Alpha, everything can be accurately measured with money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Elizabeth in a cloak, Augustine walked into the crow market in dusty dust, and Augustine whispered to remind Elizabeth to be careful of the thieves who were poisoned by the eyes, and Elizabeth The lady didn’t listen to her ear at all. When she first saw a large jewelry store at the entrance to the Raven Market, she couldn’t move her footsteps and ran outside the glass window. She stared at a blond-haired woman’s blue neck. The gemstone necklace, this woman's posture is above the standard, the body is hot, standing in the glass cabinet can earn two or three silver coins a day, if you are lucky, the jewelry they wear is bought, and you can earn a relative Rich rewards, they often stand up for a day during the day, and then lie on a goose down bed of a wealthy businessman in the evening for one night, which is equivalent to earning two yuan, of course, at their speed of making money, they can’t buy one for a lifetime. A dazzling jewellery piece. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are all proud, because during the day they wear expensive accessories and do the same moves at night, the money they get is several times that of ordinary 妓-女. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you see customers with potential value, they will have a bright smile, and even bend over, let the customers outside the window know more about the jewelry and their charming Milk-ditch. However, in the appearance of Miss Blonde in front of Miss Elizabeth, the young Master Augustine belongs to the class of passers-by who are a waste of time, so she continues to proudly hold the clothes to cover up the tight chest, like a female peacock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The necklace is not bad, this hen is too unsightly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth words as always The bitterness is mean, turn and leave. It is estimated that it is stimulated by the mature figure of a row of women in the window, otherwise her love for jewelry will never retreat so quickly. Because the crow market is very noisy, the peacock sister who was ridiculed as a hen did not hear the vicious evaluation of Xiao Loli. The Augustine who couldn’t help but dragged her away and taught: "Miss Elizabeth, don’t face each other later. Women quarrel, I am afraid that you will drive them crazy, and I will be responsible for them at the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be very good to any woman in the world who has no chest and no ass. Friendly!" Little Loli said evilly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd on the crowded road was suddenly smashed away from the sides, and Augustine and Elizabeth were directly squeezed into a small shop selling sex goods. The little girl who almost entered the state of violently climbed to the shoulder of Augustine, only to see a team of five or six carriages driving into the crow market with incomparably arrogant attitude. No market manager dared to rush out to block, let the sculpture The coach with the griffin badge drove straight in, and it felt like a nobleman who could not pay for the crow market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The group of people on the road?" Elizabeth asked calmly and whispered softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The Barbarian' Greenspan, the famous nouveau riche among the imperial aristocrats of these years, the largest family in the northwest of Marso County, it is almost in Marceau It is equal to Pompeii of the Imperial Capital. I guess they are going to the Raven’s largest legal orange auction. The place can always shoot some strange things that are not seen in the city of Judah. The family's carriage should also be rushed to the orange." Augustine patiently explained that when he was young, Luo Tongchaid had a private etiquette teacher who was responsible for explaining the history of the imperial family, so he did not squeeze into the empire's 20 families. But the notorious Greenspan is no stranger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We also go to the law orange." Elizabeth gritted her teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s useless, even if you can’t get into the orange door of the law, there are only two kinds of people who can swing into it. You can drive like a greenspan. In addition to the rich family of crows, there is also a rich man with 100,000 Caesar gold coins. In addition, even if you are a baron or even a viscount, you will be stopped outside."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin laughed and pulled the little girl off him. "Of course, if I say that I am carrying a big shaman on the Muse continent, and can prove that you are really the Queen Elizabeth." I will also be treated as a first class guest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is the first time to find a 'hot spring' buyer." Elizabeth squinted her head and looked sad Tao, because before she entered the city, she estimated the overall strength of Greenspan from the Cavaliers, almost ten big knights, this does not include Greenspan’s group of private magicians hiding in the shadows, not easy to provoke, Elizabeth does not want to become law The first auction item at the Orange Auction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. We have the most innovative little toys here, do you want to watch them with your friends, there are models for you." Always observe Augustine And Elizabeth's shopkeeper piled up a sultry smile, bowed his waist and pointed to a series of sex toys on the counter, although the white robes of the robes were not quite like the heirs of the thick aristocrats, but by himself The eyes of the guilty diamonds determined that the little loli, who was shrouded in the black robe, had a relationship with the youth. Alpha City liked to support the little girl or the handsome "boys" of the young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obese shop owner certainly won’t miss any chance to promote the brand, fearing that Augustine is too small and flattering the quality of the goods because of his small shop, he is proud of his charm: " Sir, you have to know that many of the lords in the Bodun area in the south of the city like to visit the store, like Visa Sava, and Sir Mas, who are the customers of our store??"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
