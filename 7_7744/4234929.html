			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(These two days will open the book separately, the update is not guaranteed. The stability of "God" is overwhelming.)<br /><br />&nbsp The noble heirs have two small extreme characters, one is the outstanding young people like Constantine who are placed on the family's high hopes. Even on the stage of the imperial capital, there are special positions reserved for them. As for the position An iron oak medal, Rotong Chail, the fat man of the Knights, is also barely able to enter the ranks. The Holy Empire has nearly 30 counties, and there are nearly a thousand large and small families in the official pedigree. After all, there are talents and * political upstarts are still a minority, the other is Augustine, the goddess of fate, who has not forgotten to put a few feet on the unlucky, born in a big family, but was dragged by the family burden, in addition to this In addition, the most empire is a large number of aristocratic men and women who have no worries, and they don’t want to climb to the top in their lives. They don’t need to chill to make a family title for their livelihood, and the barbarian’s treasure, Miss Alice, is undoubtedly among the lucky ones. Rise of Greens Pan does not need her to go out to support the facade. There are enough male heirs to fight for the badges and honours. She can spend a lot of time researching the fashion trends of the emperor, or read the elegant collections that civilians can't reach, or go to the night. As a supporter of a court poet, Alice’s childhood essays are essays on the ceremonial ceremonial ceremonial wife, Mrs. Sheer’s essays, especially the letters she wrote to the princes and princesses during her vacation at the Eros Manor, the most respected in the world, “娓娓Dao Lai, like a clear spring." Just as she entered the Academic Affairs Office and became the first Secretary of State in the history of the Holy See, she completely put down the quill and stopped writing. Alice had been sad for this for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, Alice will sit on the balcony of the White Elephant Castle to read books and drink the Ceylon Highland Black Tea from the ocean. It is delicious and she holds a This well-made collection of small poems is very thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past ten years, there have been few works within the sacred empire that are popular in both the nobility and the civilian circle and have a good reputation. More are "flowers and blood" Such a foreign book, but as the fourth officially recognized classical sect of the Vatican, the confessional confession is an exception, because he is the great master of the red archbishop Iyeta who chased the saints after death. There is also a book called "The Flowers Are Not Dead" by the Duke of the Empire, the Duke of Rothschild. After his death, he is much more fortunate than the Prince of Australia, who often speaks to the royal family and the Holy See. Most of the Empire thinks it is the idealistic color of the poet. Inducing the elegant Duke to betray the empire, his works have not been banned by the Empire, but have become more and more popular. Maybe even the dirty traffickers in the Lolita slave market can recite a few beautiful poems of the Duke of Mercy, but nothing. In doubt, the Duke of the Treason is the most widely acclaimed of a poem, "Flowers are not dead," and most of his poetry collections will be named after these four words, as well as the collection of poems by Miss Alice. Recently she would recite again not long "dead flowers" Every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a flower, refuse to wither."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a veteran, refused to leave the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;This poem begins with this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are probably more than thirty sentences, and it’s really short for the lyrics of the imperial empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flowers are not dead, veterans are not dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't give to my son, the future purple The owner of the flower, I and the little Augustine of Grace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End with this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is finished, put the poems back on the table, the old housekeeper immediately handed her a cup of precious black tea of ​​moderate temperature, Alice whispered: "Asa, You are going to be busy, I am alone for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, I am waiting for your instructions." The old butler whispered, quietly left this once was a certain The white elephant castle balcony praised by the bard, because the castle itself is located at the apex of this mountain range, almost occupying the entire mountain peak, majestic, standing on the spacious balcony overlooking the northwest corner of the county of Maso County, with a wide view and extraordinarily spectacular. Old Asa is Alice's personal butler. Basically, every big family has multiple butlers. One-on-one serves a certain heir. The strength of a personal butler often symbolizes the status of the aristocracy within the family, the Holy Empire. The most well-known housekeeper is probably the female steward of the Rudolf family, Ekaterina. Her female identity, and then her jaw-dropping Queen’s property is too proud. It is said that even the adjudicus of the priests has personally opened. The female housekeeper who had ridiculed the "empire watchdog" Rudolph said that she was the only one who could calm the wolf king Rudolph and let her bathe, so the stewardship profession is also a good choice for many fallen aristocratic children in the empire. Before entering Greenspan, Old Asa was a small aristocrat of Antoine County with the title of Viscount. In a country where even the authentic knights and priests could mark the price in Lolita, some did not. It is not a shame for the aristocrats of the money to support the family to do the housekeeping of the big family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is drinking black tea, sitting in the golden dusk, looking at the sky and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly a head appeared on the balcony railing without warning, and Alice sat in a chair with a teacup and a big scorpion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Elephant Castle has not recorded any madman to do the feat of climbing from the cliff to the main balcony of the castle. This is more than a thousand times more than the knights in the bard's work crawling two or three stories to sing the flowers to the lady. Alice looks at it. The head of a rose with a rose, still did not return to God, her head has not been awake from this shock, to know that regardless of the identity regardless of etiquette to rule out the madness of stealing into the white elephant castle, is summoning the holy The governor of Urban! At this point, he turned over the guardrail and jumped into the balcony. The gray robes were all dusty. He walked over to Miss Alice, gently slid it, and handed the rose to a woman who was touched and touched. She smiled and said: "You are right. The visit to the Black Swan Lake Manor is impressive, and I think it should give you the same surprise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Augustin, how did you climb up?" Alice After the silk was taken over the rose, trotting to the railing and exploring the body and looking down, it was impossible to imagine that the consul-General had climbed from the foot of the mountain and eventually conquered the cliff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Over the mountains and mountains, wading through the mountains, going to the huge castle to rescue the lonely princess, is the thing that every knight should do in his life." Augustine laughs Dao, very unkindly picked up Alice and drank a little black tea, and sipped a drink. He climbed tired and tired for almost an afternoon before he climbed over to the white elephant castle guard and climbed to the top. The cliff, almost did not need the empire boring power to arrange a big knight or grand master to deal with the young consul, he went to drink tea with God himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice twisted immediately after the mistake, the reason was very young, because she thought that she was too fancy today, leaving the fun knight a shallow vase Bad image. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin sat in the position where Alice had sat, took a breather, and saw the "Flower is not dead" at the beginning of the volume, calmed down, picked up and gently opened, poetry concentrated In addition to the recent "Flowers Don't Die", there are many prose poems published by the Duke of Rothschild, not limited to love, and his many unique views on war and religion, Augustine whispered: "Flowers are not dead" should be placed at the end of the volume, more appropriate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice nodded lightly, afraid to speak, for fear of touching the taboo topic of damaging atmosphere The emotional intelligence of Greenspan's flower is not as disappointing to the barbarians as her IQ. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin also saw a beautiful collection of elegant and elegant covers on the table. It was the work of the former royal family private literature teacher, Mrs. Cosier, obviously more than "the flowers are not dead." "It's going to be a lot heavier. The first contact with the literati, Mrs. Cosher, rather than the Secretary of State, Queen Cosier, Augustin hesitated, or opened the collection, because the words on the cover made him sneer, he wants to confirm the empire. The biggest vase is so childish and vulgar, just as he prepares to open the book, Alice has poured out his desire to read. "I heard my father say that Mrs. Cossier is the youngest court dragon knight in our empire, God, she It turned out to be a knight, but she was the most admired poet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to being a court dragon knight who hopes to become the youngest sacred knight of the empire, she is also a secret royal swordsman who can be a private teacher of the princess princes. Of course, a few poems are not enough to cope with all kinds of bursts. In the situation, it is even more impossible for the Emperor to send her to the position of Chief Secretary of State.” Augustine laughed and put the Gosheer collection back on the table. The cover says, “No matter how we resist, every flower will die, every knight. "It’s going to be old" is still squinting, making him very uncomfortable. He said some insiders that even the heirs of Greenspan could not be contacted. "This Secretary of State is a illegitimate daughter of the Windsor family who was born into the Teutonic giant. Young people have encountered many unfair treatments. When they grow up, they have a kind of congenital hatred for all nobles. It is most appropriate to put this distorted woman in the Academic Affairs Office. If I remember correctly, the Holy See was jointly tried. Prince of Australia, although she is not a presiding judge, she is the cardinal minister who is responsible for questioning and ruling the Prince of Australia on behalf of the 100-member Judgment, and let the Prince of Australia’s head hang on the holy Urbain statue, that is, to the results of spit from her mouth "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Alice pale roses holds a small quietly shaking hands. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Mrs. Goschel’s status as a similar deputy presiding judge, she must be responsible to some extent for the conviction of the Duke of Rotongs. And that is very likely to be a woman who announced the destruction of Rotong Childe. Her poetry collection is glaringly placed not far from "The Flowers Are Not Dead". Alice herself feels too ironic. This exaggerated black humor is not funny at all. When Augustine climbed onto the balcony, she ascended into the paradise of love. When Augustine seemed to calmly and peacefully say that the traitor was inside, Alice desperately felt that the goddess of love had abandoned her big fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Treating this feeling, she is not young and childish, thinking that after a smooth ride, it is a happy and long-lasting life. Alice who likes to simplify complicated problems just deliberately puts both sides together. The identity is removed, trying to unfold a most common love. It turns out that what is between her and Augustine is not only the cliff of the White Elephant Castle, but there are too many unknown factors that may be absurd. Alice stood in the setting sun, holding a bunch of roses that were no longer fascinating, looking at the quiet young man, at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I was a child, I made a mistake and I was shouted out by the teacher. I was very embarrassed at the time. I was wrong and killed. So, always one stop is a big day.” Augustine said a strange discourse that is not very smooth, no longer pays attention to what the court literature teacher or the chief secretary of state, looking to the uneasy beautiful woman, smiles brightly, like to his own site The guy poured himself a cup of black tea and walked to Alice with his cup and leaned against the railing to look at the Black Swan Lake. "At that time, the reason why I died because of the dead skin, there is a reason I dare not admit, there is a The girl is distressed for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
