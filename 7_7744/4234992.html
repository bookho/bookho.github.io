			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a woman who led the Queen’s Cardinal Knights’ outings to the heresy, a knight wearing the Raphael’s Armor, which brought countless enemies into the Dean of the Council. A swordsman who is expected to become the youngest samurai of the empire, the song of the court poet Shel-Windsor is obviously not a crisp flower growing up in a greenhouse, but when she sees the distant sacred knight Ted nearly two hundred centimeters The male fitness shadow, and nearly one hundred and twenty hunters shrouded in dark and heavy, or wrinkled by Augustine publicly evaluated as a good-looking brow, the Master’s group has only 9 cardinal knights left, 13 Gothic The Royal Swordsman, plus the creed assassin and bounty hunter, and the proportion of the Titan's enemies, made it difficult for the Secretary of State to remember the glorious battle of being too tragic. As for the ally and the four servants, the dozens of assassinations of the big and small have always retained the hidden strength to the greatest extent. Is it really an ally? She is not sure, or even sure, whether this exposure is a drama he has planned. This young man knows countless unfamiliar theories that can't be touched in academic classes, military operations, construct traps, identify plants, animal anatomy, homemade compasses, Predicting the weather, Queen Gesell had to admit that it was an ally with a profoundly mismatched age, and if it wasn’t for him to calmly let the servant become a dead soul after the death of the Master and the Little Queen, she would conduct a temporary study. Do not mind showing more friendliness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin pointed to the sacred knight Ted, and smiled at the blond teenager: "Aris, seeing the name looks strong and actually more powerful knight. You will entangle him and not give him any chance to support his subordinates. This is your only task, not easy, but it is easier than when you want to knock down Gugli Gree. If you complete the task, I promise to bring it in the future. When you go out to sea and watch the sunrise and sunset at sea, it is more beautiful than sitting here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wearing a redemptive youth, the white mask is only dark The two contradictory breaths of the eye, the sacred and the unclean, entangled and flowed, making him like a giant who climbed out of the unknown abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Kosher could not see the strength of this beautiful nephew, only knowing that the Ministry of the Ministry’s confidential documents showed that he had appeared separately at the night watchman’s headquarters. So that Juggernaut Wilde was very embarrassed, and the Church of Confession was almost half removed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adolescents can really hold back a mature holy knight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine turned his head: "Lord Secretary of State, I am afraid that you and the heroic knights will give me some preparation time, I hope that Naples will pull the gray nest scene. It affects your mood and leads you to lose your sense of play. After all, I am not ready to use this as the end of the Titan trip. Correspondingly, I will try my best to help."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surviving Little Queen Knight and the Royal Swordsman are obviously ready to face the death and can fight alongside the Queen of Kosher. This honor is worth their sacrifice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Titan hunters are approaching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Goschel rips off the cloak, revealing the quaint armor of the Virgin, the only regret is that the sword in hand is the St. Claude of the Titans Sword, but it is not bad to cut the enemy's head with the enemy's sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin glanced at the Lich King and ordered: "Naples, throwing five crystal wands over. Then busy with your go, today's feast Need your careful embellishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, who took five high-quality staff in one go, handed four of them to the female elf, which was even more during the trip. The maid who served as a vase of love jumped into the sea like a mermaid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, who has only one singer-level white crystal wand in his hand, has no movement, just looking at the sea level, quietly waiting for the news of the female elf. On the battlefield, the blond teenager broke out with horrible fighting power. The golden spear actually shattered the corner of the shoulder helmet of the holy knight, and the first time she completely let go of the war, the Queen of the song, she was astonishing. The man with the armor is split in half, and the second hunter is only slightly disappointed, and he is the poor prey of the greatest woman of the sacred empire that is strong and does not lose any male power. It is also the most famous knight in the history of the Titan. The broad sword named by Lauder was cut into two pieces by her, and then the horse’s strong body was slanted away, and a sword was split, just changing the angle. The "loyalty" Ted, who was banned by the scorpion teenager in the battlefield center, was shocked. Is it a sword saint? A female saint who is as scarce as a dragon? When did the sacred empire of the sacred empire that the sacred empire of the Titan warriors consume only the masters have a new Juggernaut? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great sergeant who brought a nuclear uproar has been relying on a large-scale spell to construct a single magic, but this moment However, from the mouth of Augustine, the vocabulary that makes the same professional magician a nightmare is revealed. Mercury and diarrhea generally constitute the most complete O'Brien memorial garland, which is a large summoning technique, although the summoning object is not the evil abyss creature known to the world. But once it succeeds, it will also bring a plague of black magic, even if it is the cradle of the mage - the sacred empire, it has not been heard for many years that a heretical magician can forge a complete memorial wreath, you know, this The "garland", which is known for its massive nuclear and summoning body, even if it involves too many black areas, many of the most orthodox old magicians can't help but praise the words "If any magician can end with a 'garland' in his life , is a very good thing." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will this be the end of the magician Augustine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more than six hundred masters of Augustine in the ears of the knight, scorning the difficult spells of the syllables and the tune of each word, his vision is lightly In the province of Titan Sulfur County, this man who was heard by the historians as "the biggest loss of the empire", from the beginning to the end, from the poetry song castle to the current southernmost Titan, did not show any grief, so much that At first, the chief secretary of state who accompanied him through half of the Titans had the illusion that the contradictory body of this cold-blooded politician and the devout priest was not so sad that he was born into the fall of the genius fat man of the family of Luo Tong's family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two creed-level assassins guarded on the cliff, resisting the attack of some Titan hunting knights at no cost, fighting for more time for the dark giant, this assassination During the busy and exciting days, they gradually changed some of the most terrible impressions. They recognized that the surname is the young commander of Luo Tongchaide who has the insidious wisdom shared by the family for generations. As for strength, they have a little bit. I am looking forward to seeing that if I can become the fourth big executive of the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice, even if I can’t be equal to the Chief Secretary of State, at least half, or one-third? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grey Nest is interwoven, and the Lich King, Neapoli, controls a number of "naughty" little dolls, turning the three corpses of the Titans to the top. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle is very glued, with the warm blood on the floor, as thick as someone's liquid to the Queen of the Lantern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illegitimate daughter of the Windsor family, the lioness standing in the top of the Rachel's tiger in the Holy Empire, the Queen of the Chess has killed twelve Titan Knights No one doubts whether she is a rising or deliberately hidden Juggernaut, because all 12 of them have proved everything to the semi-separated body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her single overwhelming advantage does not stop the death of a cardinal knight and the Gothic Swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fat man taught a simple truth of the sacred empire that guards the spirit of the rigid knight: soldiers marched on the battlefield, whether the recruits were veterans, whether civilians were nobles, died It’s not a shame to go abroad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gasps slightly, reaches out, shakes the broad sword in her hand, and a string of scarlet blood draws a diagonal line on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and glanced at the still-moving allies, pulling the corners of her mouth and pulling out a coldness that would make the conspirators of the Academic Affairs Council unable to sleep at night. It seemed to be a war that could not be hoped for him, but she There is no fear in my heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elf of the elves came out of the water, far from the cliff, but Augustine, who finally stopped, still gestured for her to swim again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin pressed his hands on the crystal ball that had been inserted into the land, and pressed it down, and the whole white crystal exploded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm sea slowly swayed, suddenly, and picked up several floors of high-pitched waves, four light-splitting columns of light separated by a hundred meters The sky has disturbed the clouds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin gently said: "Welcome to you, the ancient ruler from the ocean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seawater Quietly calm down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes many of the Titans who are shocked by the magnificent scene feel strange, and the subconscious is relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a much larger wave broke the silence before the storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large body seems to have no marginal ancient age monsters breaking out of the water, the half-snake half-dragon's head rises from the cliff. Only those scholars with knowledge and knowledge can know that this is a creature that exists only in mythology. It is nailed to the depths of the Longji trench by the Olympia god Neptune Poseidon gold trident, the mother of countless Kraken! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm priest will pay tribute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first half of the mythical creature hesitated, lowered his head, and the priest jumped to his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a small black-skinned body that moves up and down the cliff and takes up most of the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human being who seems to have tamed the mother of the spurs, the hands are covered by a red, black and two diaper balls that are half a meter in diameter, in the sky. The clouds began to tumbling and converge, and the lightning flashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother who completely ignored the sword of the long sword was swallowed by the people who chose it, and the man standing on top of it made a large-scale smashing magic that matched the position of the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odin's Hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another black magic that can make the ordinary magician feel incomprehensible. Is this guy's nuclear test as deep as the sea? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless red lightning flashes, ignoring comrades or enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A most cruel elimination and purification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, only the Queen of Gosher, the Knight of the Holy Ghost, the young Aris, the Lich King, Naples, stood in front of the card. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mother’s head is only ten meters away from the loyalist Ted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Knights face this incomprehensible existence, the first time the face shows the fear of human instinct, I do not know whether it is the sword or the withdrawal. Just in the moment of this fatal flaw, behind him, the prince-level breed who had been hiding in the darkness, Dimit, his hands "gentle" grabbed his head, kissed the Knights' neck, life with eyes The visible speed lapses, the knight of the prime year immediately becomes an aging old man, and then there is no drop of blood all over the body. It becomes a dry sac that is only supported by bones. Dimit throws it away and closes his eyes and fascinates: "Holy The blood of the knight, I don’t know if the red archbishop of Byzantine is so delicious.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled: “The friends of the Pope’s Hall began to leave. Dimit, you can lead the way, I believe there are a lot of foods in line with your picky taste."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dimit began to run, but still elegant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stretched out a hand and invited a stunned lady, like a nobleman, to invite the ladies to eat together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Gosher took the sword and jumped on the head of the ancient creature, standing behind Augustin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teenager and a Lich King leisurely walked in the groove of the body of the Khanus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a scene of “warmth”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tytan calendar April 4, 651. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Patriarchate Judiciary collectively died abnormally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cruel fact is that the most prosperous Port of Apton in the Titan Empire was destroyed by a monster nearly 100 meters long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tita calendar in May. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a series of irresistible intensive assassinations in the southeastern part of the empire. The Titans who lost the "singing lion" and a holy knight have to increase their search and arrest. At the end of the day, the two sacred knights were mobilized from the red Gogol plain near the end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Titan Empire was ruined by two wars. It is said that Prince William’s temper is a bit more violent. The most obvious example is the former army. The best-selling work of the mainland, "Flowers and Undead 3", was greatly affected, and sales were far less than 1 and 2. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no one can think of the two true protagonists, but quietly came to Uranos, the heart of the Titan Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a secluded bistro in the Russell district of Titan, a young monk who worshipped the low-level priests of the Austrian priest smiled and asked the boss for the signature Savoy I picked a corner on the second floor by the window, and the person sitting in the black robe opposite the priest finally took off the cloak. The pub owner of the wine was suddenly lost. When he turned around, he kept muttering to himself. It was a beautiful one. Woman, this tall height is not worse than the Titans. The woman glanced at the bronze cross on the chest of the madman, feeling a little discomfort, the goddess of the latest Saints of the Vatican, and also had the right to interpret the fourth official teaching of the Holy See, but wearing a thousand-year-old enemy. O's robes, private prayers every day, and the words in the Vatican's books are still in the mouth, how to see how to pinch, she drank a drink, especially spicy, but still acceptable. After thinking about it, she couldn't help but smile. She is the chief secretary of state of the Academic Affairs. He is the leader of the imperial court of the Imperial See. They are sitting in the pubs of Uranus and drinking Savoy. This is even more awkward. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked a question that had been long thought for a long time. "The Oberon pays homage to the wreath. Since it is a memorial, and it is still a mother, it should be an incalculable sacrifice." , what did you pay for, Augustine?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine didn't drink much, and she handed it to her. Instead, she took out a gold pocket watch and raced against time to complete the final link. This condensed precision project with a strong personal taste is a long way from the perfection of order. Even before the Kepler gallows battle, it began to build, so that the little things that cost Augustine's countless efforts and time, in addition to the gold case of the eccentric characters, also have a set of chain clockwork, two racks, two notes, Pawl pins, snail wheels and countless gears, and so on, as well as small items that professional watchmakers can't name and don't understand. In the eyes of Queen Gesell, in addition to the prayers that are common to the monks, this young man spends all his free time on the watchmaking, and even looks more devoted and devoted. He asks at random, he did not elaborate, just elaborate After a rough running rule, and laughing that the sound of this watch may not be the best in the world, but it must be the most unique, but unfortunately, the consuls who praised her body and swordsmanship are very surprising. She tried to hear no ethereal snoring. When Queen Gesell saw his unanswered desire, he would no longer ask. He had too many secrets. If he pursued it one by one, she felt that it would be more difficult than reading the masterpieces of dozens of volumes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watch came to an end, Augustine carefully put away the only gold pocket watch that he would not share with Elizabeth, and asked: "You need to be in Uranus How many days do I stay? I will wait for you for up to three days. At that time, most of your whereabouts will be leaked. Otherwise, I will fight for the sum of two two-headed spurs, and I will not save you."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you hear Augustine say this before the smashing of the Aps Harbour, the Queen of the song will only be a joke that is not very humorous, but now it does not feel like an exaggerated aristocratic tone, get along For a long time, she did not deny that she was very satisfied with the fact that this ally was somewhat more conscientious than her. Even she had to imagine a dream that made her feel funny: if he could be in the academic court, not holy The Ministry of Affairs, can you be half easy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin saw her rare state of thinking about her not being alert. She was very welcome to take her glass and took a sip, laughing: "Although this half year I have praised you many times, but I still want to say that when you seriously think about the problem, it is the most touching. It is a pity that we are enemies, otherwise I really want to go to the Academic Affairs Office. If I have nothing, I will go to the Office of the Chief Secretary of State. You are in a daze. Haha, I guess I am so bored, I was dismissed by you in a few days. It’s a headache. It seems that we are born to be enemies, just like my pocket watch name.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Gosher is really smart: "Destiny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bingo."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin made a snap, which he learned from Lolita butler, a gambling term for the Muse , indicating that the gambler has won. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Chessier smiled, and if she was in the Imperial Academy, this smile was the most inspiring reward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is a thief who usually puts his own "contaminated" wine glass back to the original place, and the Queen of the song is made up of this childish movement, and deliberately stunned. At first glance, Augustine smiled and poured himself a cup. Looking out the window, Uranus was more prosperous than expected. It seems that the Titan Empire was forced to pay attention to low-lying business by the sacred empire that flourished in 50 years. The pace is still a little small. After all, there is an emperor who has given the businessman an honorary jazz title. The entire epic continent is only one of Jupiter’s emperors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Chessier changed a wine glass and said gently: "We will meet here tomorrow. If you have not waited for me, you will return directly to the Holy Empire. Need to wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin certainly understands the subtext, but unexpectedly shook his head: "Without the exact message that you were sent to the gimmick, I will still Try to save the worst situation, of course you don't have to be grateful to me, I just don't want someone to replace me in your life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Kosher nodded , smiled and said: "But if tomorrow is I have not waited for you, I will not waste time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin drank and glanced She was concealed by the black robe so well that she couldn't have a good chest. He whispered: "Beautiful women have no patience and conscience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Chess Not angry, looked at the sky and said: "There is still some time. Augustine, you mentioned the collar in the port of Aps. Behavior, I am very curious, can you explain? I can probably guess that a very powerful ancient creature like Khanus Nuus must have a broad monopoly field, similar to a dragon, the size of the field should be consistent with the strength. I can think of temporary predation and breeding areas, plus the permanent field of fox hamsters that never migrate, in addition to these two, what else?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin laughed: "Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Gesell stared at Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled and said: "Really, but if you can tell me the size of your chest, I can play at a super level."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Chess's eyes narrowed and two fingers swung the glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin was so sincerely afraid of his face, "Oh, forget that my sister is a sword saint."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Kosher stood up, put on the cloak hat again, and left the second floor of the pub. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin’s tightly stretched body slacks off and quickly converges on the contemptuous look. Ares, Dimit and Lich King Naples are assassinations in the southeast. So the only one who arrived in Uranos was He and Gosher Windsor. He always wanted to find an excuse to test the nominal royal swordsman. The consequences may be serious, but it is very tiring to suppress the darkness in the heart. Especially when she started walking alone, Augustine couldn't help but want to break her neck. The reason why she didn't shoot is not to cherish her fascinating body, but the odds are really small. The choice in front of Augustine was that both of them died in the Titans and they all left alive. Augustine leaned against the chair, closed his eyes and raised his mind, and said to himself: "Let's wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin paid more than a dozen Titanmark silver coins, left the pub, alone Walking in the city of Uranus in the twilight, I know that there is a Utopia trade zone in the northeast corner of the Russell area that can be used to surprise all customers. I have measured my body and slowly walked towards the strange prosperity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the stream, the Taitan people who are not very respectful of the Byzantine Holy See have not paid much attention to this young priest, but some young ladies who are dressed up are more or less Hot eyes, but after failing to see the high-level religious emblem, I was greatly reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if these people know that the shabby priest has dozens of Titan family badges in his baggage, and many of these family members happen to die within half a year. What do you think about the assassination? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin bought a set of two "Flowers and Blood 3" in a bookstore. The author is the old Prime Minister of Titan, a rather funny old man, if not After borrowing two sets of Miss Elizabeth's collections, the big executives who have been diligent in the realm of Tuen Mun are still willing to buy them. Although they are nominally a personal biography of a Titan veteran, they are mixed with many interesting things, such as the old prime minister. I will write some fairy tales myself, just like what superficial princes and busty witches play games, the ugly dwarfs gave the beloved girl to the handsome knight, and the princess liked the dragon that took her away from the palace. And so on, this is simply too much for Elizabeth's taste. Can't blame her for trying to kidnap the old man and force him to write a sequel. This warm and warm adult fairy tale is even loved by Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the armpit, "Flowers and Blood 3", which is said to be the final episode, is used. Augustine has no purpose to walk in the ugly Utopia business district, and removes the night's accommodation expenses. There is still a little bit of mark silver coins, and finally comes to a business. The poor doll shop, even the well-informed, he will inevitably laugh, because the things here are too maverick, the tin sculpture of the knight, but the knight, the imitation dragon is the skeleton of the Dandong black dragon. The gods of the most high-spirited Olympia are shaped to be cute, and there are some lamb puppets that are similar to pulling out the belly. No wonder the business here is only a guest of Augustine. The owner is not the uncle of God. Pulling his face and sitting on the counter to debug a miniature piano, Augustine turned around, and finally a black rabbit with a tortoise in the corner, he believes that a friend who is far away from the Muse will like this little thing, Augustine In the true sense of the word, it is really less embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Augustine reached for the black rabbit puppet, the other hand held it almost simultaneously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin didn’t look up, he was so good at capturing the details that he didn’t bother to find that it’s a delicate little hand, no lady, like a work of art. It is very different from the assassin Queen Quentin and the female knight Hera. With a slight diversion, Augustine discovered a blue peacock jade bracelet that is still rare on the epic continent. It is a real product, not a replica. In fact, the price of this kind of imitation is as high as the tongue, not to mention the uniquely crafted peacock. The real thing of the dynasty royal tribute, which together with the owner's skin exudes a round and charming healthy radiance. Augustine, who was born in the ancient family of the sacred empire, knows the goods better than anyone else. It is certain that this bracelet is completely worthy of a medium manor with a good quality wine. So, I have met a young Titan aristocrat who has a unique taste? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it take a chance to break her white neck? Will it be necessary to unscrew the Secretary of State’s warm-up afterwards? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this happened in a few seconds, Augustine looked up, his eyes calm and gentle, looking at Uranus in the cloak of a luxurious white fox The lady, smiling and explaining with a standard Titan accent: "Sorry, I have taken a fancy to it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very pleasing scenery, her looks and her Like a small hand, even if she didn't take off her hat, she is still cute and close to the moon goddess. She has a pair of artistic scorpions, and her face is as delicate as porcelain. It is just a grown-up Princess Mi Fufen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine marveled at the generosity of the Creator. This woman is probably the most fascinating and fragile little stunner he has ever seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the mistake of the Queen of Cards as a general aristocratic woman, Augustine first determined that she had half the possibility of being the jewel of the Titan Empire, Barba Pull the princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only an old butler standing at the door, short and old, but Augustine is rationally pressing the idea of ​​breaking porcelain, Princess Barbara, Ula The flowers of North City are worth less than their own lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to know her strengths very well, poorly looking at Augustine, the small hand still does not want to let go of the puppet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine insisted on shaking his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stared straight at the monk who worshipped the Austrian Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin gently pulled the puppet, but the lady was stubborn, but added gravity to grasp the tight-cut belly rabbit that only let her eyes shine. She refused to compromise, she has already given it a nickname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin always has some unreasonable little persistence, so he also increased his strength without a gentleman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gently pleads: "You give it to me, I will give you one hundred Charat gold coins, no, two hundred."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not a lady who likes to spend a lot of money, this is already a big concession. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled and said: "I will give you 8 sterling silver coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squatted The head says that I don't understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin blinked and said: "That is the total balance of wealth I can currently extract, which proves that I care more about this puppet than you."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her mouth and accurately expressed her surprise, but she still reluctantly loosened her hand. He is not a gentleman, but she is very lady. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine said thank you, then took the black rabbit puppet to pay the money and left the shop calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some disappointed ladies walked to the door of the store, got into a small carriage without a family sign, picked up a pen and paper, and sketched a picture, exactly that The gentleman's Byzantine apostolic monk's head, although she deliberately demonized some, but still stunned, she still feels handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler smiled and said: "Although he showed a little dangerous taste, but the next thing is more about the atmosphere of the saints, so the old Ferdinand Did not stop the departure of the priest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes removed from the sketch, and she was surprised: "Saints? Byzantine the second batch of the Holy See Did the trial team arrive in Uranus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler nodded softly: "This priest may be a special member of the Pope's Hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She snorted, not very interested, and dirtyly lost the sketch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Titan is the closest country on the mainland to the long-lived species, the son of war, and has always been in harmony with the favorite Byzantine church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin lived in a moderately priced hotel that night, and went out at noon the next day, sitting in the pub selling Savoy white wine until dusk, when the song Queen Shel's cloak sat down on time, Augustine couldn't talk about whether it was loose or regrettable, and the Secretary of State who sneaked into Uranus at a great price was very flat, and couldn't tell whether it was excitement or loss. Augustine and her had a simple dinner, left Titan, and never asked if she had completed her mission or wasted more than forty elites. The two silently passed through the Titan territory, no more unnecessary assassinations, and even intentionally or unintentionally bypassed the red Gogol plain where the smoke gradually disappeared. They finally stepped back to the border line of the Holy Empire, and Augustine went to the Beluga Fortress to wait for Di Mitt had several servants. As for the human and the undead knights led by the Jurgen Knights, they had already returned to the Black Swan Lake. The war in the Titans was not destined to be officially recognized and commended by the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night, on the edge of an unknown stream, Augustine is counting items. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A map of the Titan County Province with more than twenty forks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty-two badges from thirty families, including the Rattlesnake family's badge and the first-class brown bear war medal, the tragedy of the Melody family is so beautiful because of the family badge, Augustine collects a few more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding, the 4.7-meter death of the Titan’s middle-level bureaucrats, plus Dimit’s sweeping, how to make up 650 people . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is satisfied with this result, not to mention the death of the little Queen Cardinal Knight and the Gothic Dragon Swordsman, which also made him feel good, this half-year More travel, summoned the mother Kazanus, killed a sacred knight who could not be remedied for many years after death, saw Miss Barbara’s emperor, bought flowers and blood. 3" and a black-faced rabbit puppet, with the clear recognition of the hidden strength of the Secretary of State, Augustine put the items back one by one, this is lying on a stone looking up at the starry sky, the starry sky in summer, always so deep and beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Rochelle took off the armor of Raphael, sitting on the bank not far from Augustine, her sword is still the St. Cloud Broad sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whispered: "Augustin, I didn't think you were a madman who was studying all the professions. No wonder you can live to this day. This is what you deserve." I began to regret that I did not agree to the request of the Marquis of Todd, and I dragged you into the mud of the Emperor’s untrustworthy. It may take a few years, maybe I will face a real ministry." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin said: "I hope that next time I go to the Academic Affairs Office, you can ask me to drink a cup of black tea that you have cooked by yourself."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laughed and stopped talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin sat up and laughed at himself: "Maybe you will have a chance to judge me soon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Chess frowns: "Do you really want to find the Earl of Dürer who is temporarily idle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She picked up a stream of water and poured it on her face, saying softly: "I only know that the Lord Archon lord immediately rushed to Ma after returning to the empire. In the county, the Academic Affairs Office can make a written certificate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine haha ​​laughed: "Who said that a pretty woman has no conscience? I am taking back this sentence now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Gosher will smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of his ability, Augustine immediately went to the Chief Secretary of State to bake a few fragrant fat fish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonfire mirrors the most powerful faces of the two empires in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, they are still more like a friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no more goodwill expressions between the two in the vicinity of the Beluga Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the southern part of the empire, Racine County, the former head of the Grand Army, Count Dürer’s splendid mansion, in the study, the middle-aged aristocrat who has been climbing rapidly in the Imperial Administrative Pyramid is writing A thank-you letter sent to the Jupiter City military, if it was not the pleading of the military’s first real power figure, the thundering emperor’s majesty would not only take him off the head of the army and The first-level punishment, but as the Prince of Columbine said to send the gallows, like the unfortunate Duke of Rotongschild, his honourable family did not mind a powerful aristocrat temporarily retired to the second line, they can not let go The whole empire is in the air. Earl Dürer wrote half, lost the quill, and gnawed his curse: "The damn traitor Rotong Chald family, even let a restless fat man let me be so humiliated, one day, I want Let the disgusting aster flower become something that everyone tramples! There is still a Augustine hiding in the countryside of the Marceau County, and a fascinating gakka that runs to the Mayan temple. Hey, I heard that this female magic The teacher is very good, I don't know if the 呻-吟 on the bed is as skilled as the curse. If I can't satisfy me, let her eat a whip!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Applause sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man stood in the darkness of the study, it was he applauding, coming out of the shadows, laughing: "I like to deal with ambitious big heresy, every time You can get a happy result."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Dürer, oh, now is the Viscount Dürer, calm and calm: "Who are you?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man apologized: "Augustin Rothschild, a friend from the countryside of the Ministry of the Holy See."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
