			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young white robe priest walks in the cumbersome St. John's Church in the corridor, just like a beginner reading a hard-hitting Chapel of the Holy See, without a familiar path leader, It is easy to go astray. It seems that this priest who is regarded as a shabby monk by a young nun is not in a hurry. The momentary loss does not hinder his meticulous appreciation of the cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young priest stopped and took out a delicate gold-colored pocket watch with a densely carved ancient Latin language, sighed, turned and walked back. He is a good memory person, so he went back to the aisle that met with the nun Charlotte. Maybe the nun who lived in the cathedral for 16 years would not know that the corridor had a name that was not famous. "Hundred Flowers Gallery", she only knows that there is a flower on every piece of marble, but they do not understand that they are the collection of the empire's many large family badges. It is the glory of the ancestors, the power of the heat, and the glory of the successors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the white robes returned to the corridor, Charlotte, who had been in a daze for a long time, just jumped to the middle of the corridor, and the young priest ignored a believer occasionally. The arrogance did not stop her childish behavior. He just walked to the place where Charlotte’s "Floritian Code" fell, squatting down and reaching out to gently rub the slightly old flower badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte jumped to the end of the flower garden, subconsciously turned around and found the figure of the monk and the monk, who wanted to disappear immediately, but out of curiosity, plus the first time The conversation made her think that the priest must be a devout and docile good believer. She boldly walked toward the white robes and laid a young priest on the marble floor. She turned around and bent out a soft arc. She smiled and said: "Lost. "?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gently retracted his hand and raised his head. The smile was like a winter sun shining into the choir of the church dome, nodding, softly: " Can you lead the way?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Going to the library?” Charlotte has no reason to reject his request, although he vaguely remembers that he was the first to ask about the direction of the meeting room. But the simple nuns first thought of the library not far from the conference room. The library is the only place where St. John's Church is open to the outside world. Many scholars and philosophers or some arty nobles like to borrow one. This book, you want a cup of milk tea from Condit I can spend a leisurely afternoon. Occasionally, young priests who are studying in the cathedral or seminary will come to the library for a day and be silent in the sea of ​​books. But this group of people certainly can't afford a cup of Caesar gold. Royal milk tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young priest smiled and said, “Go to the conference room.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when Charlotte was puzzled, a distinguished old man wearing a bishop’s robe Run quickly and majesticly, panting. The old man's eyes looked at the young man who paid tribute to him, and he sighed in his heart. He might be the only guy in the cathedral who didn't ridicule him. Charlotte looked surprised. She didn't understand why the Bishop of Pisa, who is in charge of the Pope's faith in St. John's Cathedral, wanted to stop here because of his lack of doctrine, or because of this calm priest who looked calm? St. John is not an ordinary cathedral. She is neither the main church of the Diocese of the Diocese nor the church in the parish, but the royal church. The captain and the regulations must be set by the royal family. Therefore, the Bishop of Pisa is only an empire. One of the nearly 1,000 bishops, but Charlotte once witnessed an Eastern Archbishop giving way to the Bishop of Pisa, and the knowledgeable and prestigious Bishop of Pisa humbly prayed to the poor youth priests who had washed a few times in a robe. And a face of awe? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I was lost, I had received the precious teachings of Saint Iyeta." Bishop Bishop whispered, seemingly explaining what. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original look turned to a rigorous white robe priest to reveal a sincere smile, and then looked at Charlotte, sideways to give up an empty space, indicating that she can begin to lead the way, The Bishop of Pisa stunned and quickly gave up Charlotte, and Charlotte’s squeaky Charlotte stumbled at the top and was uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte is at the forefront, the young priest is half behind him, and the Bishop of Pisa is completely behind the white robe priest, pulling a paragraph Small clear distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man remembers the saint who voluntarily gave up the patriarch's scepter, the great red dress destined in the history of the Holy Empire and the Vatican The Archbishop, then the old man’s sight reunited on the back of a young man who was about five steps away from him. Is this the son of the saint who once became the “papa” of the northwestern parish? Is there a handful of young aristocrats in the eastern part of the empire that can enter the core of the power of the emperor? Why did he choose a ministry that is only one line away from heresy, not the future dean of the Ola Theological Seminary, and the youngest priest of the future empire? Why did he personally dye the blood of the family and send the elegant father Duke Rotongs to the guillotine? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aster flower fades in the most disgraceful way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rotong Chald family, who continued for 14 generations, died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Imperial aristocrats are gloating or shaking their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the empire, without exception, spared no effort to ridicule the young man who abandoned the family and the godfather. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Otto Ghetto, where the Luotong Chaid family is located, is rumored to be ruined by the "Little Augustine". <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire empire, I am afraid that only the "betrayal" Augustine practiced the three-year-old abbey of the generation of Ola, keeping the monks as silent as ever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a contempt for the Holy See and the Empire?" The fourth Secretary of State, Palme, looked up at the big clock hanging on the wall. Shen channel, a look of anger. This real power minister, who is full of radical ideas in the reform of the Holy See and the military rectification, is not as jealous as the unfamiliar Haiji adults in the "Lecher's Tiger". She is not enough impression in the mind of the Deputy Secretary of State. The deep symbol, and the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice, with a strength to counter the entire Holy See, is more concerned and focused on power than the ** and the other two 8 hospitals. Palme does not believe that the full-fledged woman sitting in the second position really wants the heresy ruling. There is one more institution, and it is still a "cosmo" intended to sanction the entire ruling. Who wants to hang a sword of Damocles on his head? Palme sneered in the heart, who knows that the protagonist who is about to enter the conference room will die in the dark wrist of his own decision the next day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which empire is not staged a ridiculous farce? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have asked the Bishop of Pisa to search for Augustine, Augustine priest." Archbishop of the Red, Gai, sat at the right end of the rectangular conference table, hesitated, or called Augustine As a priest, after all, he has been stripped of the title by the emperor. This is an undisputed public fact. However, the Holy See has no movement on the surface because of the identity of his godfather Iyeta. But Gaimu knows a lot about Ieta. The Holy See’s dignitaries have been clamoring for the expulsion of Augustine’s teachings, and Gaimu did not hesitate to give his opinion and eventually chose to stand in a neutral position, even though he was one of the largest sectarian disagreements in the life of Iyeta. The old man is somewhat consistent with the idea of ​​Iyeta. A Vatican gang priest, whether as an invaluable red archbishop or a low-quality monk, should stay away from the struggle involving the world. Finally, Augustine was able to preserve the priesthood, not because Vatican has too many wise men like Gaimu. In fact, the opposite is true, but only the new priest is throwing a sentence in the boiling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Augustin is wasting the time of all of us. As the leader of the latest agency cosmo, this is the biggest irresponsibility." Bishop Benjamin Burton also frowned, it seems that Augustine, who provoked the disgust of the entire city of Judit, Let this conservative and conservative Holy See and Palme rarely go to the same front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cosmo, translated from ancient Latin to the official language of the empire, means "order." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A non-punctual cosmo leader, isn’t it the biggest ridicule of “order”? It’s no wonder that the open-minded archbishop has always complained of innocence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Benjamin Burton, are you questioning the decision of the Emperor?" The second secretary of state, Sa Di, frowned, the minister was close to Judith the Great. The loyalty of madness is no less than the hatred of the Pompei family to the infidels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Benjamin Burton’s face changed dramatically, and he did not wait for him to explain that the Archbishop of the Red, Gai Mu, had been able to be dragged into the Ministry of the Holy Spirit by the political enemies. "The deputy secretary of state, the pivotal bishop only states the facts. With his piety and loyalty, he will never be disrespectful to the emperor. Well, let us wait patiently for the arrival of the priest, I don't want to let the future cosmo person in charge When we open the door, we see the picture of our quarrel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin Burton naturally does not dare to attack the Rachel's tiger, showing his hatred, he is wise The land transferred all of the anger to the latecomers who were swaying, even if the "Hai Ji Da Ren" far away from the aristocratic world showed a certain affection for Master Augustine, but the smiling face and crying face of the upper circle can be taken seriously? The shock of one of the three giants of the heretical ruling, which was originally a strange attitude towards Augustine, was lightened after the tempering of God. After all, today’s protagonist is only a common enemy of the empire and the Holy See, a young man without a family*. What waves can people pick up? Moreover, it is rumored that Emperor Jubit is also not cold or hot to the young Master Augustine, otherwise he will not deprive his nobles of the title of life. As for why a secret cosmo was born, the well-informed aristocrats thought that it was the "dark hand" of the priesthood that the ruins of the priests had to use to make the last sable flower petals of Luo Tongzier disappear from the dust, The perfect way to be silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now the young big men are so impatient? The empire is in jeopardy." The body of the mermaid, the singer of the mermaid, smiles, her flattering always It is difficult to escape the suspicion. The words spit out in the mouth did not care about the idea of ​​the cardinal minister and the red archbishop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hai Ji adults." Sadi coughed a reminder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big guys in the room are dissatisfied, but no one wants to make a sensational statement to this woman, is this woman who is older than the Archbishop of Red? Throw into a heresy ruling? She is the top arbiter who came out from there! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall and full-bodied female Haiji adults snorted and continued to hold their help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two old guys of Lester and Teutonic are definitely not going to join in the fun, really boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She held a finger of the gangster and gently curled her ear to the side of the blonde, looking around for a week, she did not find a man who dared to face her, a group of weak Bored male creatures, even the ambitions of conquering the females are ruined by the comfortable and comfortable aristocratic life? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark giant began to hope that the young and lovely Holy Seecher would come to the meeting room early, if he could throw a few nobles or bishops into the sacrament The prison is the most fun. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is to become a 4th seat of the Secretary of State, can be squeezed to death, or become a sacred spear, the shield must open his eyes and look at the giant Dragon? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The mother of the ewe" narrowed his eyes and slowly thought about this relatively interesting question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the mysterious young priest in Charlotte’s mind is approaching the conference room step by step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to see the iconic building of St. John's Church, he always smiles and asks, Charlotte is also willing to answer his questions, ask questions and answers So that Charlotte is increasingly not convinced that he is a major player qualified to enter the conference room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bishop of Pisa is quietly behind two young people,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man listened to Iyer He was grateful for the teachings of Archbishop Red, and he remembered that at the end of the conversation, the saints said a word that made him memorable: my godson, the child of Augsburg, would go. Going farther than me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the saints? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man shook his head gently, and his heart was full of sentimental feelings. Ieta, the child in front of you, must let you down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The royal knights headed by two emperors near the knights are in the two rows of conference hall corridors, meticulous, dignified and majestic, let Charlotte go the last leg Extraordinary warfare, even the well-informed Bishop of Pisa couldn't help but hold his breath, especially when the old man saw the Royal No. 2 Knight, who was only seen behind Judit the Great, and the golden color of the sun. A pair of facial paralysis, only revealing a pair of eyes, luxurious and shocking, the Bishop of Pisa bent down and bowed his body, the pace was heavy, the three finally walked outside the conference room, Charlotte has pale face, she is generally clear inside the door What is the power of the big man, for Charlotte, she wants to say a word to them, it is a desire for luxury, and it is the ambition to be repented without being allowed by the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I turned around, Charlotte saw a warm, still-faced face, smiling at her, grateful, and letting Charlotte relax in an instant. Forgot to sit in more than 20 positions in the conference room, more than 20 unattainable empires are sitting in the chair and staring at the door. Charlotte saw the young priest standing in the center of the door, sorting out the ordinary robe that was poorer than all the priests of St. John, and then took out a Charlotte who never saw the nobility in the cathedral. Wearing a badge, a very beautiful strange flower, unfortunately broke a third, she suddenly remembered the pattern seen in the corridor when the book was written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put it in the chest position of the robe and slammed the door open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheap old-fashioned white robes, worn-out dark purple badges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a lonely aristocratic priest? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly lit, unusually glaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte reached out and blocked his forehead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half is the sun that pours from the sky through the dome into the conference room, and half of it is the hidden light of the characters in the position, and the Charlottes see each other individually. Over or arrogant or deep face, suddenly gathered together, let her over the head, fear and panic back a few steps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
