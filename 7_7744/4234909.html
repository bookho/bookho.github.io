			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1st floor lobby has a lively Marceau County landlord who quickly retreats but refuses to leave the French Orange Auction Hall, although Alpha is located in Los Angeles. The underground arena next to Rita's slave market is the third-ranked bloody entertainment venue in Maso County. It can be seen for free to witness a heretical knight being sent to the unclean abyss. It is definitely worth taking a small risk, let alone Now even the prostitutes hope that they can listen to some anecdotes when they are swaying on the bed. The landlords are happy to let them devote themselves, not to the fact that some Bourbon silver coins are purely accommodating their bloated because of greasy food. Body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are we going to show our identity now?" Miss Elizabeth is eager to try. In theory, the specifications are the same as the three organizations of the Ministry of the Sacred, but the special powers are better. Since the birth of "order", she has been screaming with the young giants around her. She hopes that Augustine will now go out and tell the wealthy false believers who are the papa that dominates the voice of Maso County. father. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, I want to see what kind of strength the Helen family is. In addition, the two unruly leopards are still tossed by others to be half dead. Willing to obey." Augustine decided to continue to sit on the sidelines, a female madman who completely squandered the rest of his life with Rotong Chald, a large-scale experimental knight, enough for Augustine to abandon the self-deprecating "holding", one in Alpha City is still unable to "redeemed" the dark giants, and then only the end of the world is eroded by various enemies, the most important thing is that in Augustine's cognition, the imperial aristocrat is a very boring species, you pump him A slap in the face, and very hard, he will put his face closer, but if you show the virtues of many aristocratic oral advertised words of kindness, generosity and honesty, he will quickly ignore your existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Descartes takes a deep breath and holds a long sword on his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Orthodox knight is simply disdain to use a variety of "hybrid" swords, they always hold the standard Temple ivory knight sword, although the war uses countless The example of blood proves that the knight sword in the hands of the knights under the horse can not compete against the Viking sword known as the "great hybrid", but the big knight Descartes still chooses the temple ivory that is increasingly abandoned by the practical knight. sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked directly at the opposite of the blond burly man whose tyrannical value would only be above him, not even looking at the enemies on both sides, one is still a few The tulip magician who is going to buy the threshold of the Royal Society, plus a strange swordsman who uses the Solomon-style sword, his only regret is that he can’t ride the horse into the orange, and drive straight into it, at least for Hera. Miss is a perfect ending impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is my prey."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Helen family’s man like a golden lion opened his mouth and the dagger fell to the ground. At the end of the story, the dagger had fallen. Into the hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of the onlookers, it seems that the golden lion appeared in front of Descartes in a moment, and the dagger in his hand was drawn to the neck of the big knight, and Descartes was also in the first place. After the withdrawal, when he is about to open a suitable spacing for the ivory sword of the temple, the golden lion is close to the front, and does not give Descartes the opportunity to play the length advantage of the knight sword. The dagger made of special materials is different. The dark color brilliance, the dark gold sequence element is characterized by the ability to break the elemental composition of the physical magic, in addition, it is cut by the skin, even if there is an Arcane master's healing totem aura blessing, it can only heal slowly, so one The dark gold dagger is almost the first choice for all upper-level bounty hunters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a 20 cm dark gold dagger plus a 50 cm arm length is the golden range of melee warriors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The distance of 70 cm is my zone of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a legendary reward The gold hunter "Iris" Auston is widely circulated a famous saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great knight of the wolverine can only rush to meet the sharp dagger of the route. The audience on the first floor is stunned, and one can’t help but hold their breath and open their eyes. They can only faintly illuminate the golden lion's long-haired man's vague figure. The unique light of the dark gold dagger is because the speed is too fast, leaving a residual arc-shaped image in the air, and the frequent Mars after the dagger collided with the knight sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Descartes retreats, and a few meters away is the column where Hera Bolsefele stands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peak state of a big knight should be wearing a high anti-magic weight, with the great momentum of running horses, and finally raising the gun tail, will hide in The enemy behind the shield punctured, and then passed by, the enemy's entire body was picked in the air, and finally fell on the ground, this is the standard war of the Cavaliers, not like Descartes A ribbed knight sword fights face-to-face with an opponent who is good at melee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no fear of the great knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he first encountered on the battlefield, the imperial knights flocked to their camps. The fierce enemies were covered with luxurious and heavy armor. The beautiful long guns were new and sharper than any high-ranking knight in the Saxon forest. At that time, big The Cavaliers were only 14 years old. In that battle, he survived the brutal cost of four gunshot wounds and a fire element magic burn, and killed a middle-ranked knight who was hooked down and an arrogant but unlucky one. Magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Descartes has once again had no way to retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden lion's dark gold dagger will puncture at different speeds each time, attacking the most vulnerable parts of Descartes' body, eyes, nose, neck, armpit, Because the similar speed will allow the experienced combatants to withstand the offensive with a keen instinct, this will not meet the battle style of a bounty hunting manpower to minimize the strength to kill the opponent, so from the beginning to the end, the golden lion grasps the initiative, Very comfortable sliding and jumping gave Descartes a ring-and-loop squad. He was quietly waiting for the moment when the Cavaliers breathed for the first time. It would be short-lived, but for his hunters in this series. enough. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Descartes was only a few steps away from the cylinder, he suddenly stopped his body and spit out a sigh of relief, while the sneer golden lion took the opportunity to succeed in dark gold. The dagger pierced the chest of the great knight, because of the relationship between the defensive circle of Descartes and the distance from the heart, but the expected goal of the golden lion has been completed, as long as it is drawn out and then the second wave is not given to the chase of the Cavaliers. Then even if the great knight can continue to persist, the dark gold dagger with secret elements and liquids will gradually expand the wound on the chest, which is itself a chronic death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when the golden lion was ready to take out the dagger quickly, he found that the enemy had a sly smile, and he was surprised to find that the big knight was stabbed a narrow hole. The chest muscles suddenly contracted, and the jaws were extremely arbitrarily clamped. At about the same time, almost five times the speed of the sword was erupted. The golden lion did not hesitate to abandon the precious dagger, bend over and retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knight Sword cuts the golden hair of a golden lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Descartes is ready to seize the fleeting last chance to fight back against the hunter, a series of unexpected lightning balls from a white crystal wand Pulling out, building a line of defense between the big knight and the golden lion, the big knight tried to tear the lightning chain consisting of 7 lightning balls, but the ordinary knight sword was already at the limit under the impact of the dark gold dagger. The state, instead of breaking the lightning chain, was smashed by this 30-level elemental defense magic, and the big knight's mouth smirked, then pulled back and pulled out the dark gold dagger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was greeted by a thick water snake composed of two water elements. The 42-level "double-headed snake Naga" spiraled forward and flew in the air, rushing to the great knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pull out the dark gold dagger that pierces the chest will only accelerate the erosion of the dark gold element, but the only benefit is that it can be protected without anti-magic armor. The Cavaliers used it as a weapon to cut off two raging Naga water snakes, and the remaining water column leaned toward the cylinder. The physical magical impact of great power swayed the cylinders up to 4 meters in diameter, and the ground behind the big knights was lost. After control, the micro-hot water that has fallen from the fall is dispersed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Descartes bites his teeth, a cockroach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first hand in the hand blocks a deadly blow without warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But his arm still sputtered a blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far away, is an eccentric swordsman who pulls out only a slender Solomon knife, with a drop of blood on the tip of the knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hunter whose hidden strength is still unknown cuts the wound first, then the sorcerer draws the line of sight, and finally the venomous snake is given by a swordsman who is more like a white assassin The general bite, very tight fit, no big knight can be unscathed under this perfect cooperation, Descartes resists the strong desire to breathe, because it can only accelerate the loss of his life source, he Resist the pain in the chest and immediately greet another round of killings initiated by the white robe magician and the Solomon knife assassin. The singer-level crystal wand drives five small fire snakes, and there is no trajectory in the air to predict the flutter. To the big knight, this is the strength of the tulip magician. It is not difficult to control an elemental fire snake. At the same time, it is necessary to control five "small pets" to dance in the air with super-distance in the air. It requires strong spiritual energy and outstanding elements. Affinity, of course, ample nuclear is the foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Solomon's knife assassin also pulled out the second knife. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Descartes turned his head in desperation and looked at the top of the column. He could not see the figure of the goddess in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows that even if he bites his teeth against the fire robbers of the white robe magician and the two knives, the real killer is actually that the head looks like it’s not moving. Gold lion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in the Saxon Forest, he began to close his eyes in the big knights who fought against the empire, but did not give up the resistance. He whispered: "The knight is immortal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, almost all the halls felt unusual fluctuations. It was a clear and profound change from the golden lion, the Solomon knife assassin and the tulip magician. It was between the entity and the spirit, but it was pure Let the hidden masters on the 2nd and 3rd floors feel uncomfortable. They found the perpetrator faster than the average audience. A black robe magician standing in the corner of the first floor, a black staff standing in front of him, only behind him. A red sphere with a total of about 20 red and black colors emerges, and a magical pattern resembling a magical array is formed behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the red and black spheres is not getting bigger and bigger, but it is getting smaller and smaller in violation of magic. It makes people feel the squeeze in the most intuitive way. Pressure, contracture, and compactness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;璀璨. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two glaring spheres rush to the big knight Descartes at lightning speeds several times beyond the fire snake, and Descartes wants to use dark gold daggers for instinct. But it destroys some of the small balls that make him feel suffocated. It seems that they are more horrible destructive than the previous 40+ "double-headed snake Naga", but he is scared to find that the magical elements are almost inherently aggressive and dark. The gold material dagger can't cause loss to those small balls, and more than 20 spheres are also wound into two hanging circles, showing ninety degrees of crossover, holding the big knight in the center, and the five small fire snakes that arrived first. The audience stunned into the circle, but they were swallowed by the red and black alternately arranged spheres. They became the nourishment of this defensive magic array. The sphere became smaller and smaller, and it circulated around the Descartes with vital signs. More and more scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon Knife Assassin even simply gave up the sneak attack and stood in the distance to observe the spheres with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden lion is puzzled. How can a dark gold dagger not cut a small magic sphere? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most shocked is the tulip magician, Alman, who is also an elemental magician. It is obviously the elemental sphere of the original order, any badge of the Magic Association. The magician can pick it up. He can even create a large number of elemental balls without a spell. This is just the cheapest and most boring magic in the magic field. How can he solve his fire snake? Elements devour elements? Moreover, how the mysterious young magician made 10 red spheres and 11 black spheres at the same time, which is like a person drawing a circle with his left hand and a square with his right hand. This is only the most rough analogy and more detailed. It is the left hand holding the oil bottle right hand water bottle and dumping it to a measuring bucket. It must be the same weight of oil and water. The continent's heavy magic history books record an unreliable record. There used to be a woman who walked alone 124 years ago. The Maya Temple, the highest hall of magic, created a "miracle" that produced 27 pieces of each element at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
