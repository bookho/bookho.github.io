			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin flew back to the border town of Digu in the fastest speed. This small town entered the mainland with a view of the two empire’s sacred alliances, observers At this time, they suddenly created the National Astronomical Observatory almost at the same time as the gorse, but they learned that the Tycho Observatory was still in the rough stage of observing the celestial body with the sights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin immediately wrote an appropriate apology to the foreign minister, and immediately wrote in the study room tens of thousands of words about the human geometry of the card, with an accurate The map, with the two corners of the Digu town and the bell fortress, constitutes a straight line. This is the assistant’s alternative compensation for his serious dereliction of duty. After dawn, Augustine finishes the prayer, drops the wax on the edge of the envelope, and walks out of the study room. The official door, he sent this secret letter to the imperial court. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer officer did not dare to neglect a devil's assistant who easily killed the Piaget "close friend" and two Templars, and immediately arranged for the highest confidentiality. Signaling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, the agreement was signed in the rudimentary Digu official residence, the head of the empire empire Ibn is the main person in charge, the first signature, the assistant politician Augustine Thereafter. Kumung is handed over to the same person in a series of important documents that have far-reaching influence on the empire. The thin sacred survivor of the singer, the prince of Philippi, the middle-aged duke of a stature like a barbarian is A very small number of empire eager to wear the Queen of the Queen, this gambling has brought a rich return to the Duke, the middle-aged bald man who was only an empire of the Far East before the coup, quickly emerged as a Visa ice sheet Some have mastered the mouthpiece of the southern part of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Ibn saw the rude prince of the ruthless singer who was used to the axe, and the slender geek, and the most ignorant aristocrat of the Holy Empire. A more elegant signature, a sneer in the heart, no doubt, whether it is the Count of Ibn, or the empire of the Empire who has just left Digu, the subconscious minds regard these documents as the gift of the Emperor's Majesty. The assistant official Augustine has been very calm and timid. The line of sight has repeatedly stayed in the bald man's shawl, which has been worn for many years. The Duke of Camille, who is nearly two meters tall, also looks at the Vatican several times. A monk of the Tsang Thom's regular robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Affiliate Agreement is relatively simple compared to the New World Definition and the Holy Alliance General Agreement, so the process is more like a blitz than a protracted war, the shabby Valley even There was no banquet for the squad, which made the rich Ibn Earl had to pay for his own time and a sublime to make a temporary celebration feast. Although there was no such thing as a Jupiter city feast, it was a damn card. There are the most tender truffles and the highest caviar. Usually, even if these things are properly preserved, they will be inevitably reduced after being transported to the kitchen in the middle of the empire. This time, Count Ibn did not forget to take the initiative to invite temper. The politician attended the banquet, but he did not find anyone, causing the count to eat the golden yellow caviar with full granules. He can follow the emperor friends to the gold medals of the most fashionable grizzly gambling, but this does not mean that he is willing to face face to face conflict with the young sacrament giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine is heading to the Digu Valley National Observatory. Unlike the gilt Greenwich Observatory, which is protected by layers, it does not block outsiders, but it is not accessible to the Big Ben building with a series of large sighting devices at the top. What is interesting is that there is a ban here. The sign of the building, even the guards did not. All the emperor kings of the epic continent adhered to the principle that they must distance themselves from the general aristocracy. This is especially strictly for the Jupiter emperor. The dominance of these countries is increasingly disliked to be physically present on the battlefield, but the card is a complete and exhaustive one. Alien, their Empress not only approached the nobility, but also approached the civilians. Not only the Digu Observatory, but even the entire imperial people opened the Winter Palace with eight professional museums, without the need to visit the upper class. They all need to wear dresses and exquisite gloves, and encourage writers and painters to go to various museums to view historical materials and Linyi ancient paintings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is standing under the clock tower. He knows that there is a clock tower with the world’s largest ancient clock. The ancient clock of the century ago weighed 300 tons. It was originally placed in the bell tower of the Ivan Lei in the bell fortress. Every time it rings, it will be the loudest horn of the war, but the new queen will ring the first time after she ascended the throne. The crack was then carried to the Tycho Observatory and placed on top of the clock tower along with several huge sights. Downstairs Augustine said to himself: "The well-made sights are even better than the lookouts, but they are still lacking in the distance of observation. They can't be more than 19 inches in diameter with the gorse Greenwich Observatory. Lookout is beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., are you an astronomer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behind Augustine There is a natural sound that is cool and unobtrusive, and the official voice of the sacred empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin turned his head, of course he had long felt her approach, but there was no danger, Augustine had always believed that he had nurtured in numerous assassinations and assassinations. The sense of smell and intuition, the beautiful woman who looks flat, in terms of the information revealed by the pace, is a good knight or swordsman, but only limited to this, she can not with the royal family like the Queen of Chess The swordsman is on par. The most important thing is that she has nothing to do with her. Augustine doubts her identity, from the sacred empire to the boring aristocratic lady who visited the town of Digu? Augustine replied with a smile on the basic etiquette: "A literary enthusiast who can count as a half-hanger has helped the teacher to record some observations when he was a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She suggested : "Let's go upstairs?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine pointed to the sign and shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laughed: "You can pretend not to know the card text. For such mistakes, the card master will not pursue it, just guarantee that you will not commit the same. If you make a mistake, you can get your first immunity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine was dumb, but did not hesitate to take the lead. The demure woman's mouth is not stunned. It is clear that the young priest of this sacred empire respects the rules, but at the same time does not refuse to take advantage of it, and is very gentleman, proactively squandering the immunity. The two walked together on the empty Big Ben, and Augustine saw the Ivan Ray Big Ben, which had witnessed countless wars. There was a shocking crack. The sight in the building looked giant and rough, but Augustine was half. Inside, a little observation will know that the grinding of the lens is very skillful. He noticed that the details of an ordinary person would not pay attention to it, but the heart was shocked, but even Augustine was surprised that the woman beside the body was familiar with the scope, calmly said: "Look It’s up to you, yes, the Digu National Observatory is different from Greenwich, which explores the sacred scales of the celestial bodies. Four-fifths of the instruments here are helping seafarers find meridians and see the regular movement of the moon through the stars*. A clock, then compare the local time with the 'local time' obtained by observing the sun on the ocean, and use the difference between the two to determine the warp. This is not just what we are doing, the secret observatory of your holy empire is also engaged in the sea theodolite. Manufacture. The only difference is that we don’t deliberately hide anything, and your far-sighted Jupiter the Great, hi Everything is quiet and quiet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine had to ask abruptly: "Excuse me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She is still frank and moving, quietly smiles: "My family is still rich, and like you are a 'half-astro astronomy enthusiast', privately funded the creation of the Tyco Observatory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine is speechless, her sincerity, so that he can not be treated with the general aristocratic routine. But what foundation is this sincerity based on? A woman who can explain the principle of the sea theodolite simply or accurately is not a wealthy but stupid aristocratic lady, or her family who claims to be "still rich" has a good power position in Kamo? Will she be associated with the Duke of the Visa, the owner of the Visari Ice Sheet? Just as Augustine guessed the truth, the young woman once again showed Augustine her ability to be almost mysterious mind-reading. She chuckled: "Is the hobby-loving assistant, guessing which family I came from?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
