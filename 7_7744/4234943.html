			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Heber does not care about the long-lost Luo Tong Chaid title, and the Emperor’s most sensible big aristocrats do not take cosmo seriously, because Cosmo is simply a doll that was placed on the countertop by the Judah Emperor and the Trident, and maybe one day it will be drowned by the Dark Big Three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the Earl of Dulion of the Mather family and the great bourgeoisie of the great banker Lifao gathered in the White Elephant Castle, they had to regret all After leaving the county of Maso, the Count of Heber began to be curious about the young governor of Augustine. The rumors such as the gods and the dragons were mostly untrue, and it was not doubtful that a group of real powers would leave the Marceau with their tails. Everything, now the emperor is very enthusiastic about this topic. Some of the lords who bet on Augustin with the cosmo for three months are all screaming at the chest. The Caesar gold coins of the big ticket are all gone, and the number of the priests of Heber does not believe in fame. The strength of the letter, the strength verified by blood, undoubtedly, the new neighbor of Black Swan Lake Manor gave the answer that he was not willing to accept but had to admit it with a scalp, sleeping with a beast nearby, taste bad, business The savvy Heber has been looking for opportunities to wait for the opportunity. In his opinion, the White Elephant Castle is annoying cosmo, can he show enough goodwill? It is not the alliance with the cosmo whose fate is unknown, nor the enemy of the treason. This is the bottom line of Heber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows, the young giant of the famous empire grabbed a spear first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best is to be on the spot with the big man's official and woman's oily slick, and to rack their brains and try to figure out the strategic intent and specific tactics of this group of uninvited guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the Earl of Heber's Ascott Manor, the financial vampire Lifa, the false believer, the bishop of Poland, the traitor, the Earl of Duro, and other heretical knights entered the black Swan Lake, I am very sorry.” Augustine picked up a chair and sat down, still smiling, but said in his mouth that the “judgment” that can make many people frightened, not giving the opportunity to the Opposition of the Count of Heber, Augustine waved his hand, “On the Sabbath Violation of the doctrine to hold the competition, throwing the orthodox knight into the Colosseum, and the heroic performance of Viscount Heber today on the big bed, I can give a moderate relief, but the first point, I am a little disappointed, the red heart lion is not always Is it true that defending justice is an empire? Is it true that the order established by the Emperor’s personal approval is not justice, but gimmicks?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiona After carefully helping the priests of Heber to wear clothes, he realized that the handsome knight who claimed to be the Grand Archon was not a guest of the Ascott Manor, but a potential enemy. She was sleek and she saw the atmosphere was stiff. The letter full of Master Heber was stunned by a large and empty speech, and Mrs. Fiona, who was full of maternal love, immediately came out to play round. Unfortunately, she just opened her mouth and was hit by a whip on her face, a welt. Shocking, pampered for many years, the fake lady squinted, not convinced, in Marceau there are even more unreasonable aristocrats than the barbarians? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whips are Miss Elizabeth, and the motive is simple. She just can't understand the fullness and sorrow of the lady's chest. She sees the moving look of Mrs. Fiona's sorrow, a burst of fire, and a whip. However, this whip was tightly held by the Count of Heber, who was pity, and it was obvious that the Viscount had a unique feeling for her. Otherwise, with the caution of Viscount Heber, it is impossible to make any provocative behavior at this sensitive moment. Elizabeth, who was holding the long whip, smiled sullenly, and threw the whip dirtyly. He shouted in the Muse: "Poseidon, Apollo, suck the soul of the dog and man!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two small Lolita butlers who are outside the giant door, when they hear the owner’s call, immediately flash red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calm down." Augustine frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elean little princess glamorous Elizabeth pouted, grievances, but still honestly removed the orders of the two great witches. Both Poseidon and Apollo were in the position of the twelve gods of Olympia, but she was treated as two sly names, but apparently no one would have enough to support her blasphemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello Lord, please forgive me for this, Miss offense." Viscount Heber was aggrieved, and must keep gentlemanly on his face, try to Find a balance between dignity and flattery. At first glance, Elizabeth made him a bit stunned. It is not as beautiful as human beings, so that the singer has always been gorgeous, and the number of the princes of Heber has not known whether it is a woman or a young lady. Can't be said to be a child, the child bred by the Ministry of the Sun, is no different from the child of the devil. Viscount Heber used his eyes to indicate that Mrs. Fiona had opened a bottle of wine and saw Augustine sitting in a chair. He did not dare to stand down and look down at the neighbor, nor dare to go to the chair to sit down, so he had not had time to put on his shoes. The Viscount had to bend over, and as for the four Marceau County who had the identity of the swaying women, they quickly dressed and shrunk in the corner of the room, and the atmosphere did not dare to come out. Among them, they were fried by the Heber’s Visa The flower girl of the flower season, there is also a jazz title husband who is lonely and uncomfortable in the field, and even a senior nun of the Mausoleum Blanche nun, in her 40s, the body maintenance is excellent, and she must win in the bed. Experienced to get the favor of Viscount Heber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s okay, this is a trivial matter." Augustine shook his head and blinked at the distance of Mrs. Fiona’s wine-drinking posture. The woman of the masculine mafia No. 2, who is a civilian, is not very outstanding from the face. It is also medium among pretty women, but fortunately she has a body and temperament with a face, a peach blossom. Eyes, mature body exudes a kind of desire for men to invade and sin - criminal desire, Aunt Quentin actually talks about physical capital, to win over Mrs. Fiona, Mrs. Nafiona is congenital and plus by a pair of hands A man who has never counted a pair of feet has been trained, and naturally he knows how to pinch a man's mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viscount Heber gave Augustine a good glass of wine, and explained by the way: "Lord Lord, I want to explain, the Earl of Dulton, their knight is under the leadership of the Greenspan family, enter your estate. I was not in the castle at the time, and you understand that Greenspan has always been rampant in the Marceau County, and will not put Lancôme Castle in his eyes, and I have heard that Lifao and Count Dulé once gathered at the White Elephant Castle. ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine interrupted the shift of sight of Viscount Heber, carrying a glass of wine, not drinking, smiling: "I heard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Heber immediately sighed: "Absolutely true."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is silent, and there is no expectation that Viscount Heber is expected The anger and uneasiness in the middle made the Viscount Heber feel puzzled. The Fiona behind him was even more inexplicable. A handsome guy suddenly emerged, and then suddenly a little girl gave a whip, then the young The man sat down with Master He Bo Allies generally drink and chat, and Mrs. Fiona finds that her brain is not able to turn around. The most frustrating thing for her is that she finds that she has no confidence in conquering the sacrament of the sacrament with the flesh, thinking that she has not yet followed The man in the ministry fought in bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin finally said, "Forgot to tell Viscount Heber, I am the hostess of the White Elephant Castle, Miss Alice's private magic teacher."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Heber has a blank mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine sneered: "It seems that the Estee Manor still does not want to come up with the sincerity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Heber bowed his head, his brows wrinkled, and gradually turned from panic to horror, and then everything disappeared, and a smile appeared in the corner of his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, although he did not see this interesting change with his own eyes, continued to fight against the intimidate heart of Viscount Heber. "I know that Memme is not at the command of Louis Butler." Going to the Mississippi Arena, I also know that the smart Lady Fiona has triggered a hidden small organ in the process of taking the wine. I guess it will not take long for the 200-member Knights to be rooted in the northern part of the Ascott Manor. The ace of the German family, the Red Heart Lions, is also on the way to Lancôme Castle. By then, the entire Maso County must be very shaken, shocking the grandeur of the red-hearted lion, and also surprised the ecstacle of the Count of Heber, you see, this The pure suite that must have been visited by the Archbishop of Ram, must have become the latest negative example of the Holy See. At that time, the Viscount’s father, the Marquis of Todd, the red lion of the Holy Empire, must also be pleased with the family’s Heber. Viscount is such a heir to heroic warfare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viscount Heber raised his head and finally faded all the disguise. He said: "Augustin, you need Caesar gold coins, I will give you, you need free knights and women, I will give you, but if you want to target the Ascott Manor, Fighting the Lion King!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it great to fight the Lion King?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin strabismus Viscount Heber poured the glass of red wine on his face and said: "I will not let go of every spectator in the Mississippi Arena. I am not alone with a lion with no teeth. It is with all of you. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of Viscount Heber straightened his waist and gently wiped the wine with disdain, laughing loudly: "Augustin, you know the 200 Knights means What? Do you know what the Red Lions and the Knights of the Great Knights mean? I am very curious, the powerful and confident Grand Executive, do you have two holy knights? Or are there dozens of dragon knights ready to go? As far as I know, the last time cosmo won was not easy, the whole poem The castles are destroyed. I really don't understand where your self-confidence comes from? Is it the arrogant belief of the traitors?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Things are not that complicated." Augustine Shaking his head, he turned his head and looked at Mrs. Quentin wearing a Gaia mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin’s heart beats violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin released his hand and the glass fell to the ground. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the glass fell on the fluffy wool carpet, Mrs. Quentin sighed in her heart and slammed the dagger to the uncle, the Count of Heber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor Viscount Heber has only one honorary knight title, can only watch the female assassin puncture the dagger into his heart, then gently stir, life will flow like a passing And go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis and Fiona hold their mouths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cutting his head." Augustine whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin has nothing to do with this, she can only do it. Fortunately, she is very strange to the swinging waist, and she is quite familiar with this bloody work. The head of the dead and eyes wide open in her hand, bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four unclean women hiding in the corner were screaming intermittently and screaming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unclean dust, attributed to unclean dust." Augustine is still sitting in a chair, very comfortable, feels the need to move a few back to the poem The private study of the castle. I recited a classic statement of the Sardinian doctrine that only the middle-aged woman of Blanche’s nuns understood. He turned to tell Elizabeth who was eager to try. “The four sinners who have no value give Poseidon and Apo Let's make food."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great witches broke into the door directly, and the group of women who were huddled together were mad crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine hesitated and looked at the nun and asked, "Can you prove that the Count of Heber has seduce you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tears of the face have been nodded to the dying nuns, grabbing the last straw, sobbing: "I can!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gentle and obedient lamb, the father will take you to the right path." Augustine smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged nun who escaped from the dead sat alone on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other three women also began to wisely declare that they could testify against the inconsistency of Viscount Heber, and Augustin responded: "Several of you can move home." The vase will only offset the justice and conviction of the testimony of the devout nun."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big witch stepped closer, and the final scene was terrible, and the result was imaginable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth's eyes wide open, and she refused to miss any details, just like feeding her kittens and puppies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looked at Mrs. Fiona, who couldn’t help but approach the Louis Housekeeper, and asked, "Smart lady, can you be as honest as this nun?" And sincere? If not, the little queen who doesn't like your chest may use you as a food for her pets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Fiona Biting his lip, desperately said: "I can, I can."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stretched out and took Mrs. Quentin’s head Channel: "You are not going to leave the Ascott Manor immediately?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
