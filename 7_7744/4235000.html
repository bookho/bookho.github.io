			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Byzantine Holy See, the father of the continental spirit, the believer of the bread, always called the ancestral ancestral temple made entirely of megaliths in the wild continent. The Tower of Sin - Babylon, and this new midgod member will collectively add a layer of architecture for thousands of years, which is already higher than the Pantheon of Mount Olympia and gradually approaching the Mayan Snow Mountain Temple with innate advantages. Humans defeated the dragon and finally signed the holy place of "Moses Commandments". Maya also did not have any good feelings for the building that tried to reach the height of God. The eleven kinds of the crow badges were obtained, except for signing the master servant contract with the higher dragons. And the most epic singularity is to go to the distant wild land, and go to the shamanic temple to personally remove a huge stone. It can be seen that this ritual has tens of thousands of shrines of the ancestors of the ancestors of the sacred ancestors. It is a majesty that can be ranked among them. It must be a shaman who has made achievements and built trees before his death, and then he can float in the temple altar with a pure soul. Above, always overlooking the mainland until the day recorded in the last chapter of the Prophecy, the greatest prophet in the history of Shaman: "We are the arrow of the arrow, shoot the angels, leave the low places to their God, and leave the heights for myself". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temple standing on the plain of the Souls of the Soaring is towering into the clouds, standing at the bottom of the building, even if there is no cloud, it has not seen the apex a thousand years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, a terrible war has just been born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imposing grandeur is comparable to the war between the human empire that has invested more than tens of thousands of troops, but it is only the king of the two wild continents. The Duke of Maja Black Sheep, which is purer than the dwarf Auberge, is the greatest character of the three hundred years of the throne of the shaman. In the long period of three hundred years after the summit, in addition to the last challenge, it created a little trouble for the king. There is no Shaman's younger generation who can bear the "destruction horn" of the shaman emperor, and they have turned into low-pitched dust. As the price of provocative emperor, they cannot enter the temple after death. This time, it is the trouble again challenge. This is a crazy adventure that gambles on everything, even if she is Feng-Jima-Elisabeth, in the two areas of summoning the golden subspecies and the soul transition. The most outstanding shaman queen of the contemporary era. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war that lasted for one day and one night was finally calm, and hundreds of shamans who were chosen to enter the temple as honorable priests returned to their place, with a shock in their hearts. And in awe, the war that took place at the foot of the sows at the foot of the mountain slowly ended. An elder of the temple, who is also the deputy speaker of the demigod, is under a wall, and a dry hand is attached to the ancient cuneiform on the wall. The place where he is located means the most rigorous inheritance and the most glorious habitat. The old man is very short. Even with his human standards, even if he is standing up straight, he is not even one hundred and sixty centimeters away. What is more, he is still stunned. The most helpless is that he is standing behind a student with the blood of Titan. In the mild form, it has reached two hundred and fifty centimeters. In contrast, the old man is becoming more and more small. The moment when the old man’s fingers fumbled is a white eagle with olives. The lines are peaceful, but the ancient words are full of resentment: the flood recedes, they God stood here and promised that the land of both eyes will be milk and honey, but we are deceived, so we will hold a long sword and puncture the starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The girl you crushed, lost to the invincible Majia Black Sheep?" The old man may be older, the logic is very chaotic, since the shaman is invincible, who can win? This is a lot of problems. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student stunned: "Our emperor still blew the ruin of the horn, which shows that he is really angry this time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small and sighed by the old man with a humpback and no height: "I don't have a good ear, I can't hear it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The student whose strength is absolutely proportional to his body is angry: "Is your ear not shocked by the ruling horn of the speaker?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarf haha Smiled: "Dante, thank you for reminding. Sorry, the teacher's memory is not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf stood up and walked to the stone column of the temple, waved his hand and went to the sand, trying to see some of the scenery below, the soaking plain because of the war The dust was so thick that the temple was shrouded in sand, but the temple was going through several tornadoes and sandstorms every year. The temple rituals were used to it, like the dwarf elder, Dante, Chasing the tortoise's bad habits of excitement, you will be excited to punch at the root of the tornado, directly smashing a dragon. The old man coughed a few times, his expression was sorrowful, and he said with regret: "You have a crush on the girl for many years. I am afraid that there is no third chance to challenge the emperor. The next hundred years are destined to be boring. This time, apart from my abstention, there are five. The deputy speaker agreed to expel the little girl’s family from the parliament and become a low-lying nation with a half-orc. This is a bad, too explicit conspiracy. There is really no subtle beauty. We should learn a human being. We obviously have a stronger body, but we forget the existence of the mind. We can't hide our weaknesses with a 'human being that beats us by a low rate of reproduction. Dante, wait for your beloved girl. Secretly buried, you go to the human landscape, it will help you to practice in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students are: "This is not allowed by the temple. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf glanced: "Idiot! Your teacher is the great elder of the temple, even I have not seen you buried for little Elizabeth, who The eyes are more visible than I am. ? & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp phase and truth "<br <br /> & nbsp />;The descendants of Titan's giants grin and smile, unusually simple, but still filled with grief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man with a squatting figure reached out and touched the sparse hair that could not be left. He said: "I hope you can reach the Maja Black Sheep one day." The height, for any ridiculous conspiracy, is too lazy to pay attention to."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semi-giant Dante whispered remorse: "I am a coward, neither able to protect her, Up yet, she hasn’t said anything to her.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf turned and kindly exclaimed: “Remember that there is a human love rumor, the teacher gave you: those who say Love, only love expressed in hot words, is the trick of the lame knight to deceive the ignorant lady. Dante, you are neither a knight, the girl is not a lady who will be happy to hear a few love words, so put away You have no sense to regret. The teacher gives you a small suggestion before you go to the human continent. When you can defeat the Magha Black Sheep and break his black horn, you tell the old guy loudly, 'Woman who hurts me. , just give me a '."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&& Nbsp; Ding Ding's face is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man laughed and said: "I have forgotten what I just said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher and Students are silent together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two intentionally or unintentionally avoid the fascinating picture at the end of the war, I am afraid that even the two continents can enjoy the fireworks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the hundreds of ancestors of Dante’s beloved girl, dissatisfied with the cruel practice of the temple, collectively choose to destroy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old man, the most wise conspirators on the wild land, the dwarf Aobei, with wide eyes and an incredible face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rainbow traversed the two continents and rushed toward the temple in a sacred manner that no soul could resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Sacrifice Temple, who had just lost the souls of all the ancestors of a certain race, once again rushed out of the hall and rushed to watch the miracle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarf Aobei said: "Human, holy coming?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this The old man saw the face of the adjudicator and sat down on the ground, muttering: "Which bastard, use my God's left eye magic array to summon St. Urban, and the damn is brought here. I knew this was the result. I even admitted that the intelligence could not match the idiot King Quinn, and I would never design the magical array that is perfect!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Urban is on the wild continent, with a huge body, the left side is a holy wing, the right side is a chaotic bat wing, and the face is half an angel and half a demon. This non-divine neutral is one of the seven rulings of the seven sins of the Bible. He did not occupy a place in the Pantheon of Mount Olympia, but it has sacredness, but no one doubts. The mythical fragment of the sheepskin records that it is the goddess of destiny who gave the fair balance to one of the main gods. This is the Saint-Ulban who appeared at the foot of the temple. He was sentenced to "arrogance" and it came from a mysterious abyssal plane. At the bottom, Tartalos Hell, all underworld Hell's nine dogs are its loyal guards, only before they descended, the hell dogs who swallowed fallen angels and low-ranking gods were loyal to that plane. Hell dominates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Urban sees the golden eyes and calmly looks at the temple of worship, which is vaguely familiar, and the atmosphere is covered by heavy arrogance and anger. Anger is ignored by it, but arrogance is exactly its food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man in a plain robes jumped from the head of St. Urban. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is holding a Titan Longan Staff on his right and holding a 264-page hand-written book "Teaching" on the left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three giants who have just been worshipped by the Holy See, the Mayan Temple and the Golden Island are also called "the biggest heresy", "the madman", and the self-digging grave. The young priest, for the first time in his life, stepped on the soil of the Muse. When Saint Iyita, who loves and is full of hopes for the godson, wrote "Teaching" in his later years, the only leisure time was to sew the robes for the most proud teachers, and finally completed three pieces. Augustine appeared for the first time as a sacramental giant. In St. John's Cathedral, the whitewashed robe is the second one. Later, if you are afraid of damage, you will save it and then wear it. It will really be scrapped. As for the first piece, it was broken in the Kepler Gallows Battle, which became the fuse. The game would not have become a religious war on the hell of human beings. The timid Augustine has been standing by and doing the mean way of ignoring the blocks of faith. It was not until this red-groom monk with a view of the landscape was ruined by the violent Werewolf King Berkeley that he had ruined his beloved robe. It was the only time that the night watcher butcher lost his senses and changed from a radically self-interested self-interest. A reckless war madness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine had already seen the temporary bloody altar. He slowly squatted down and grabbed the sallow gravel that was unique to the sower's plains. He still slipped from his fingers, and silently said: "The dust will eventually return to the dust. Everything is unclean and dissipates in front of my eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin with no emotions stands up, whether it is an auction value or a religious symbol, the preciousness is only second The "teaching" of the original manuscript was dismantled, and the 264-page page spread out with him as the tide, and then disappeared instantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evil altar that tries to strip the soul of a defeated man is not far, is 1,500 meters, but enough to build a few hostile Square matrix. At this time, many enemies standing in front of Augustine, there are many geniuses who have come to see the jokes in the past: many female warriors of the Amazon family, they hold the "moon sickle" instead of the javelin of the general race fighters, which means they are The singer of the "most powerful female group in the world"; the elder elder who is second only to the eleven queens of the elves, their iconic silver hair is the most infatuated and most touted wig material of human ladies, for which they are willing to go bankrupt; The Tauren chiefs who painted the ancestral totems, their power, came from the refuge and grace of the ancestors of the past. At the far end, there are more than a dozen high-level shamans responsible for the dark rituals of the altar, the closest enemies to Augustine, the servant class responsible for cleaning up the war—the half-orcs, gnomes, and each without status, voice, and fixed home. Hybrid species with no number of classes and talents that are dominant in this continent are not particularly powerful, but numerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many dark species seem to have taboo against St. Urban, behind Augustine, and dare not take the lead in opening the battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But don't forget that the guy wearing the robe is sitting in the position of the heresy in the butcher's role. Augustine slightly dragged the Titan Longan Staff, an epic-class wand built with the eyes of a sacred dragon. The longan opened a slit and the light skyrocketed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin has surrounded thirty red balls of light and twenty-one black spheres. The subtle difference in quantity is due to the inertia of this left-handed child. The private magic teacher in childhood said that the left-hander is conducive to the continuation of life. For the magician, living for a few more years is a few steps on the path of the magical principle. Augustine can live to this day, it is the hard work of countless small details, tirelessly extracting all the dark theory in the banned book that is conducive to its own growth, placing tens of thousands of dominoes only to exercise control of the slight power, even in sleep A spell that does not allow deviations in a syllable. 51 red balls and black balls converge on the restless elements, blasting the nearest 20 dark species, leaving some creatures that are only blasted from the head, a wild but powerful soul. Augustine is precisely calculated, because it will come in handy right away. He has a dozen neat little things in front of him, the essence of martial arts, and the gray nest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting from the Titan longan, a dozen red lines led the fresh scorpion line and turned to kill the same family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic, whether it is orthodox white magic or taboo black magic, has one thing in common, which greatly tests the magician's thinking ability and turns divergent thinking into substantive control. At the legal orange auction site, the old Carver's metaphor is very vivid. The magician is an alternative painter. He needs to draw a circular right-handed square on his left hand, requiring simultaneous and simultaneous completion. The harder thing is that the left hand holds the oil bottle and the right hand holds the water bottle and tilts to the water cup. The weight of the oil and water is equal, and it is more difficult. The control of the gray nest is an extreme example. The gray nest is not lost. Go out on the line, be sure to synchronize and resonate with the soul of the soul, in order to play the dark meaning of the gray nest, otherwise how can the scorpion be able to separate a big branch from the magic tree? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin’s murdering method is very entertaining, and it’s more difficult to be more direct and efficient, but his progress has not stopped, in the loss of a half-orc After the body was blown into pieces, he showed the identity of the magician and the sorcerer. He extended his left hand and gently said: "The Queen of Dorothy from the right to die and to keep the tomb, I did not choose to surrender to you, but please Give me the source of breaking the spear of San Carlo. Please erect the Helen Grave Handwriting, The Prestige Rest, The Ferrer's Chapter and The Last Epitaph."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred spirits are suspended in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a secret sneak secret praying, the final chapter is ushered in: "Through the tombstone for the unwilling to rest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous tombstones broke through the ground and became the burial place of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most frightening thing is that in addition to the Irish Undead Book, the familiarity of several kinds of occupations can no longer be used with the horror to "praise" the madman at the same time with 60 The tour of the first-level large-scale magical Vulcan, as well as the goddess of the high-order arcane time goddess who made the action slow and therefore more desperate, set the sight in front of this monster, is the purgatory: the tombstone of the undead is constantly rushing out of the earth, The wild species of the continents collided into the air, and the strong ones who were lucky enough to crush the thick tombstones also faced the burning flames of dragons in the middle of the tombstones. This is obviously not the turmoil of ordinary fire elements, which is heavily regarded as a dark species. The holy atmosphere of the largest invisible enemy. The "sacred scorpion" stagnation in the warlock field will bring the damage to the ruthless maximization. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real final chapter only makes them collapse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this ruined cemetery, there is a shaman that is qualified to delve into the proficient totem poles - nicknamed "the soul of the extradition of the boat." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This human being, even the soul has not let go! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is there a field that he won’t? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walks alone in a cemetery where both body and soul are destroyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lonely, indifferent, horrible, face the second enemy: Amazon warrior, elf elder, naked Tauren chieftain, and several hidden races Big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine, the eyes are strangely red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This coward from the big aristocratic family is very selfish, an absolute rational to cruel realist, facing the Knights of the Marquis of the Lion King Todd in Lancôme Castle At the beginning of the regiment, I was prepared to abandon Mrs. Quentin. In his mind, this Florence kitten, which can only solve the body's desires, is no more useful than a lich. At this time, this coward is very cautious in speculation, secretly seeking the maximum benefit, so that the female knight Hera returns to a dangerous jihad compared to the poetry song underground world, instead of letting her stay in the dark study room to pinch the shoulders, she really It is very likely that you will be killed in the battlefield where the dead are every day. He never loves, never shows a sincere smile because the enemy is a beautiful woman, just like the chief secretary of state, who walked friendlyly through the Titan half-empire map, which still can't change Augustine to crucify her on a tripod. Original intention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the typical pessimistic Augustine also has a real fearless time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a poor man, I’m going to have nothing, you have to ask for it? Ok, then I will pull you down to hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin raised his hand and bit the middle finger, and the blood dripped on the Titan Longan Staff. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This short gap, a moon sickle soaked from the bodies of countless poisons whirls past, piercing the last priest of the priests, on the shoulders The upper part of the meat, the venom quickly infiltrated into the nerves, the reason why the moon sickle is known as the sickle of death, not the sharpness of its blade, but the horrible venom, gently touched a drop, even if an adult Tauren chieftain is so life The strong body of the goddess will also be paralyzed and unconscious, but the nerves and souls will suffer, and eventually taste the hell before death. But the man who wore a robe of robes had no expression. He ran a man who thought that he could harvest the head of the tauren, and he was able to pluck the head of the tauren, who was only one meter away from him. The forward inertia followed the human priest and took a half step back, but this did not prevent him from using his staff as a spear and slashing into the head of the Tauren Chieftain, who is nearly three meters tall, and has not forgotten to stir it. It smashed its brains, only the Tauren chief who had been bleak in his ancestors' pattern, saw the bloody smile on his lips, and heard his ridiculous words, but he could not understand: "Natural enemy It is more lovely than an unruly ally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadly dead body was easily thrown away by the priest who showed non-human talent in the field of the Master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any idiot with this ass knows that this metamorphosis is definitely a warrior, maybe a powerful human knight or swordsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the question is, is this guy really a human? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man with a sense of reason will come to worship the temple to make a cemetery? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at that time the guy was pressing one hand on the head of an elder elder, burning her delicate silver hair, of course, except The hair is too gentle, and the body that the elf is especially favored by the creator is also turned into ashes. In the flame, the elf struggling on the ground is so sad from the depths of the soul. This flame is more than a tour of the holy atmosphere of Vulcan. Amazing, it is the golden color of jumping. The young man who smeared his own and the blood of the enemy was only looking at the last elder elder into a mud that could not be redeemed, and he was indifferent. Even the elves of the long-range warfare have perished, and the Tauren chiefs who are born with melee do not have to doubt their end. The second hell, leaving only two Amazon women, and a shaman "red branch" member who had caused him the biggest scar, the red witch warlock - the plague craftsman. The body that infiltrated too much poisonous cockroaches, was ripened by the red sorcerer, and Augustine, who had serious damage to the robes, revealed a large area of ​​sick red decaying skin. According to common sense, the human body, unless it is the most mature sacred knight or The Juggernaut in the final sanctuary can resist the burning of the furnace, because this burning is the heating and consumption of life and soul, and the degree of pain is proportional to the strength of the body and the thickness of the faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin spit out a sigh of relief, turned out to be a shocking scarlet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the altar that is still undergoing complex rituals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steps have to be stepped up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head to look at St. Urban, who had been silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter nodded lightly, drifting to the temple of sacrifices made up of countless vicissitudes of megaliths. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly climb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine pulled his mouth and looked at the red witch who was already timid. "Flea, I am going to break your hands and feet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handheld Staff The priest is crazy sprinting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Amazon warriors breathed a sigh of relief, circling a beautiful semi-arc, preparing to support the plague craftsman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time, their foothold stood out two Irish tombstones and several deadly red and black spheres. The lightball exploded along with the tombstone. The tough female warrior fled with horror, but the next doom came one after another. Augustine used this rich death atmosphere on the battlefield to create two imperfect but powerful Poseidon spears, waved and penetrated two already. The exhausted female warrior smashed the body, and the scorpion was stabbed into the earth. The red witch snarled with the wild dialect and prepared to use the witchcraft drawing drawn urgently under the foot to transfer the battlefield that should only be left for the death. It succeeded, but in the short-term contact war, the human priest who pre-judged the general orientation was arbitrarily erected in six directions to erect a larger Torah gravestone, but this time it was not broken. Instead, they landed in the air and smashed the red witch, who is far less powerful than the allies, in the pit. It was too kind, and the pain did not have time to enjoy it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest left the second battlefield and encountered an Amazon "Mrs." who was pierced into the earth. The monk wearing a quaint robe gently Feet, smashed the milk-room where only one member of her race was born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest’s vision is the thirteen warlocks summoned by the Duke of Maja Black Sheep from the Temple of Sacrifice, for everything on the battlefield, Never listen to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under their feet, it is a huge pit filled with blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two end-eight gold subspecies that have hoped to become the sacred existence of the dragon, and the powerful black Mamba snake has been broken into two by the unknown blade. half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy is dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This naughty guy used to like jealousy. When the owner showed a little relative to the human monk, he was violent and tried to swallow that human being as a bait. In the abdomen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nile River has only one big head left, and it is almost dying, but when its silver eyes look at the human figure that it has never hated, and even feels close, it finally closes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little girl, also dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest’s eyes are colder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy and the little girl are hungry, and at most a little hurt, she will be sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the ruined stone pillar, a petite girl was nailed into the body by a black horn, a scarlet blood running down the feet, in a stone pillar The groove flows down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest walked up to the edge of the altar, and immediately there were countless shaman souls guarding the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned a blind eye to this, just looked up at the Temple of Sacrifice, destroyed by St. Urban, and said the first sentence of Gospel 16: "You Hiding in the dark, singing loudly, laughing at the light, but not knowing that the trial has arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest suddenly inserted the staff into the earth, and the tone calmly calmed: "God Say, there must be light."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between heaven and earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glorious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six hundred and twenty-four pages of the "Teachings" that shed white awns form a perfect circle in the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This holy circle is rapidly coming to the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire altar was blown up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All unclean, return to the dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shamans who are about to complete the final ceremony are all in the pool of blood, and the broken limbs are broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spit a swearing black priest who continued to move forward, did not pull out the Titan Longan Staff, and picked up a shaman's arm on his toes and put it in his mouth. Chewed it, tasted it, revealed a smile, spit it out, and gently said: "It's really nausea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This movement is clearly beyond the scope of humanity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest suddenly speeded up, and the place where the previous second was located marked a ditch that was two meters wide to half a meter deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a sword slot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little boy Black Mamba should have been killed by this sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the owner of this sword must have been engraved on the Mughal Stone for countless years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what about it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin just rushed to the under the stone pillar, one hand pressed on the pillar of this sorrow, hard to stop, the one who lived in the gorse The final stripping of the soul in the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her life has withered, she can’t open the pair of spiritual eyes, can’t squeeze a playful and spoiled smile, she can’t fork anymore A neurotic princess laughs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advancement of the cockroach, the black blood rushed out of the mouth, and the priest’s original clean and ruined robe was even more dirty and ugly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second sword slot appeared, cutting the altar, rushing to the priest and the sorcerer stone in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest did not have any retreat, but was completely ruptured by the robe, and there was a blood trough on the back where the spine could be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the stone column. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth on the mainland of Muse, only Lori steward who is a friend of Augustine, walked with him across the river, the mountains, the church, the desert, The battlefield and the lonely little princesses are more and more fond of reading "Flowers and Blood" and buying a crystal cream foundation instead of letting the enemy tribes all struggle to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her closed eyes, she shed two scarlets of red, not knowing whether it was blood or tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small, delicate princess crown fell from a small, low-pitched hand, and the fall was crisp and loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be spent on dozens of Caesar gold coins, but the poor-stricken egg Augustine has paid a lot of money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until then, she finally let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is really tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tired little princess failed to see the scene of the holy fall, but seems to know that the most timid and most fearful of Augustine, finally came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a fool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin facelessly withstands the third slot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting his hand to pick up the little crown, stand up, pull out the black horn that makes his palms turn into a group of burnt meat, gently hug her, will The little crown was worn on her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tear off all the remaining robes of the upper body, wrap her and tie them on the back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, revealing the upper body covered with scars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bending over, there are still priests who are half-length robes, like the same beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sword-bearer with a human figure stands on the apex of an Irish tombstone on the first battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the price of the request for St. Urban to descend to the temple? It is this God's penalty arbiter who is summoned by the risk of life and will soon return to the abyssal plane that belongs to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin has come to this step, what is the price paid? It is the consumption of life at a speed of countless times, which is like widening the mouth of a life hourglass, and it cannot withstand squandering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but does Augustine regret it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter which world you are in, which plane you are in, you have to leave the calculations and really guard the people and things you have to care about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
