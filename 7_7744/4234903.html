			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Trust me, wait patiently, I can tell a very interesting story and build a very interesting world.)<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength growth rate is not proportional to the body's maturity progress, Elizabeth left to pick the right choice, can't wait to get into the box, and finally choose to put a bottle of golden crystal magic liquid in the pocket, with that Gold is tied together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;傀儡 is a very important part of alchemy. Any golden dragonfly needs to capture a powerful creature that inhabits the dark abyss and shrinks its soul into Hey, the darker the creature, the smaller the volume, the smaller the volume, like Augustine, who is less than 10 centimeters in her pocket, is the "big aristocrat" in the doll. The most amazing thing is that these are banned. You are not a dead person and you need to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scarce solution that Elizabeth took with the logo "Vulcan Saliva" is an excellent food that is specially designed to replenish energy. In any continent, the final form appears. Golden items are worth a lot of money, and seven of the top ten "God elements" are one color with gold. Then Elizabeth picked up a black silk glove, and the back of the gloved hand painted a pattern of the eclipse. When she put on this slightly huge glove, the pattern burst into a smoldering light, just like the explosion on her back. The magnificent day-wave phenomenon, centered on the back of her hand, reveals a bright sphere that is gathered by countless round lines. As she transforms her own nuclear raft into the wonderful magical array of gloves, the bigger and bigger, almost her whole The man shrouded, and Elizabeth exclaimed: "Wow, finally a little aristocratic meaning, what are you going to do next? Our 'order' can't always be an empty shell, need to grow rapidly before the enemy is determined to eradicate you. Get up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s almost a lot of work, knowing that Miss Elizabeth’s memory is countless times, and I don’t need to show off your height in front of a poor worm. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin laughed, there were two gloves, she was black, and one was red, and the judge of the Priestess Gloves are very It seems that these magical items are made by "pro-magic elements", and then draw a magical array with a target of "fusion" or "attraction", which can make an elemental magician play 120%+ or even 130%+ The level of super level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is not embarrassed in this regard, he gave the black gloves to Elizabeth, put on the red gloves covered with fine gold wire, and took it from the box. There is a rare "Capricorn Thought Book", even in the arty aristocratic circles of the aristocracy, there is no trace of it, Augustine knows that he still saw it when he wrote the scriptures in the Monastery of Ola. Turning over the Capricorn, the first page is a line of words written by the second priest of Vatican Tegang: going forward, looking forward, thinking forward, the day of physical destruction is my spiritual immortality. A moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine opened a page, which was a reading of a red archbishop in the Holy See. It shows that the book is of extraordinary origin. He even found the writing of the godfather Iyeta on the second page: God will save those who are purely motivated. Righteous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Take it away from me, I hate it!" Elizabeth was like a cat that was stepped on the tail, clawing his teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin puts on the box and holds the Capricorn Thought Book under his arm. He is wearing a glove with a Titan Longan Staff. Now he is confident that he can stand alone. Dealing with a Piaget-class aristocratic blood family, because the Chapel of the Chapel, which has been blessed by many devout people, is rich in faith, this "Thought Book" is even more outstanding, so even if it is only turned over It can make Elizabeth feel a little discomfort. If you tear off some of the magical arrays that Augustine is best at, the power is incomparable. Augustine is a freak in the magic field. He has a wonderful nuclear capacity. Extraordinary theory, especially in the magical process that can maximize the leverage principle, Augustine can always give the opponent such a "surprise", so the vigil has such a statement inside, would rather give Augustine a sigh level equipment, do not give He has a home court advantage with plenty of time to dominate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin walked out of the room and was ready to visit Pandora in the wheelchair. "Next I am going to Alpha City to buy a batch of slaves and craftsmen. Alpha is the largest in the middle of the Empire." Slave market, I am now in a headache to convert the black box into Caesar gold coins in the box, and if there is a chance, hire a group of low-level magicians who can understand the drawings."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, you don't want to hit my mind, I am in my pocket, your things are mine, my things are still mine." Elizabeth was quite arrogant, then she looked puzzled, "Slave and craftsman? Low-level magician? Augustine, are you burning your head? Do you want to spend money to buy a batch of cannon fodder on the Black Swan Lake to be a human bastion?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin No explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curiosity of Elizabeth continued to ask: "Is it necessary to build a group of buildings around the poem? The problem is that unless you can erect Hungary in a short time. A big guy like a castle, or you can't stop the pace of a medium-sized heresy, Augustine, you shouldn't be a slave to buy a slave to Alpha to pick a maid? I can hear about Alfa's better auction. There are a lot of beautiful things in the line, the Humbert woman with big breasts, the blond white girl in the buttocks of Coruso, the long-haired Weshennu, the Sague area with flexible tongue, the person, the small waist can Twisted Titan female prisoners, maybe there are female elves on our muse, the young female aristocrats who were being trafficked, oh, ah, color-love mad Augustin, you are too evil, I want to protest!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine interrupted Eliza's jealous and unfounded runaway during the day, and smiled and said: "You are the absolute color - love mad, I said, I have never heard of it. I just have a small idea. , very interesting kind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth stopped the "sad" of a lady who was not a lady, squinted her head and was completely interested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to copy the left eye of God at the bottom of the poem to the entire Black Swan Lake." Augustine smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are really crazy." Elizabeth was a little sluggish for a moment, muttering. "Do you know how many empire Caesar gold coins a God's left eye magic array needs? Ten thousand or ten million? And you claim that the national strength has completely surpassed the sacred empire of the Titan Empire. Last year’s military budget was twenty-four million Caesar coins! Augustine, you mean that you can use a batch to say no value. Does the waste create one-thirtyth of the Imperial Army? Even in the city of Judit, the great figures of the Holy See have been kicked and broken, all agreeing to the material needs on your list, and then counting your current private wealth. It can only create one-tenth of God's left eye, not to mention that you still need at least three years, and that you can't squander now is the time!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The perfectionist's argument."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin laughed, "I am just a pragmatist, I just want to be within the scope of my abilities." Take out some gold coins and roughly copy a god’s left eye. In addition, I don't have the ambition to completely copy God's left eye now. I just use the abundant nuclear content and some branch line points to set up a relatively large-scale 12-magnificent miracle, not perfect, not fine. If you can't be ambitious, as long as you can play the most basic defense, it's ugly, funny, it doesn't matter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth smashed for half a minute, finally Pulling the scorpion and screaming loudly: "It's so interesting, it's too spectacular! Augustine, you hurry to make money for me, make a lot of gold coins, and then we will create this miracle in the history of human magic! I believe in me. The most beautiful Queen Elizabeth on the Muse will be loaded into the history of all races because of this beautiful building of the Temple of the Gods! By then, my reputation will surely surpass the rude dwarf Aubey and 'Emperor Sa Full of 'Duke of Maja Black Sheep!'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now it's your turn to be crazy." Augustine shook his head and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, in order to express the gratitude of a great female of the Muse, when I go to Alpha, I will personally help you choose a maid." Elizabeth smirked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Elizabeth, I think Professor Shirley upstairs is very good. Can you see if I can hire her as my personal secretary?" Augustine’s eyes lit up . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two balls in her chest are too heavy, which will seriously affect the work efficiency. Her legs are too long, and your study is too small, it will inevitably be awkward He bumped. Moreover, her ass was too big, I couldn't provide her a special chair!" Miss Elizabeth smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin already knew this result, and the member of the study, the chief researcher, Miss Yi, gave him the information. Elizabeth also looked at it in detail. Obviously she already Think of the mature-female sister Shirley as the number one enemy. Augustine smiled and reminded: "This time you go to Alpha, don't bother me. There are a lot of great aristocrats in Maso County. Maybe you are a relative of the Imperial Power. If you are accidentally destroyed by humanity. I am a little priest who has been stripped of the title. You can't let me tell them that I am the 'order' of the consul, this underground organization that is not officially recognized, I am afraid that even the general bishop has never heard of it. I don't want to be rubbed by a whole bishop or a dozens of swordsmen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a beautiful woman, and you are an empire certified Knight! The guardian beauty of the knight is a very sacred truth!” Elizabeth protested loudly. If she didn’t bother Augustine, the trip to Alpha was not very boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait for one-third of Professor Shirley in the chest, half of her ass, and two-thirds of her legs, not to mention a nobleman in Maso County. The young master's private knights, the red archbishop and a large group of honorary knights behind him, I will not frown." Augustine laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now they have gone to the door of the Starry Hall named by Augustine, Pandora stays inside, and Elizabeth gives up the bite of him, actively turns around It is estimated that it is not going to the Augustin study to study the opened treasure chest, that is, to go to the bottom to hold the gang to be in a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin gently walked into the square at the bottom of the lake, and Pandora, who was facing him, looked up at the Black Swan Lake, a blue opal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
