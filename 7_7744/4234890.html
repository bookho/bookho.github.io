Add it slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a lot of room for the character and the main occupation setting. Come slowly, then the number of words should be doubled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1白蔷薇王朝<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The original apostolic brand of spades a. From this spade, we can easily guess that she should have been the first power of the epic continent. But for a short time, the giant collapsed. The "Western Farmers Treaty", which was signed with the four kingdoms, was jointly supervised. Only rely on the white virgin virgins - a natural stunner to support the treasury of the emperor Eliot VIII. (The final setting of this empire is still pending.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2Golden dynasty<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest black Peach a<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3Titan Empire<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first military power in the mainland. There are 10 holy knights and 6 samurai. Known as "the son of war." The Gogol statue was one of the Knights of God's Whip, and was attacked by the Knight Rhein Hatai in the glorious hills. Prince William, the imperial war god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4卡妙帝国<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kingdom of the forgotten kingdom, the northern gate of the epic continent, from the orc The nearest territory. For humanity, it resists the influx of countless waves of the wild continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first hundred years, the epic continent is willing to spare no effort to sing the heroic fearlessness and dedication, but in just two hundred years, the praise will be small. To this day, it is even more utterly absent. All the nobility of the kingdoms of the kingdoms are only willing to ridicule the unlucky luck, and the ridicule of the knights without the knights. Only some desolate poets who are not in the main pop, see for themselves. Outside the city wall, there are crowds of tens of thousands of fierce orcs who have been smashing all the year round. I have heard the night whistling or the crying of the dead soul, and will make some faint sounds, but like throwing a blank on the broad lake. Insignificant pebbles, no one will pay attention to this. The two dynasties, the white rose and the gorse, some young poets are taught by the predecessors who are very popular in the court. If you want to write popular literary works, you must Don't show anything about the card in the work. It's just a backward kingdom that even the tail of the civilization doesn't catch. It's as barbaric as the aliens of the wild continent. Guests sat on horseback went so far as carrying the ax, which is more like it? If you lack food, you will kill the warhorse. If you are thirsty, you will drink the blood of the Orcs. Is this still a knight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 Holy Empire <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A book of the "National Wealth", which was cast aside by the orthodox, accidentally appeared on the desk of the emperor's emperor, making this empire rich in magicians jump Become the most prosperous country in the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1People standing at the top of the pyramid<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santa themis: a mysterious woman. An early magic enlightenment teacher who can be the protagonist. From the deep and deep test of this person, the beginning of the second chapter should say that she is: "In the natural world of the weak meat, the more the king of the beast, the more like the kind of away from the herd, overlooking the feeling of the human being, human beings too So, because the superior does not walk with the humble, and this person is the king of the king, we can only vaguely know that she appeared in the Mayan Snow Mountain Temple 119 years ago, appeared in the Golden Island 78 years ago. The most recent clue is that 49 years ago, she appeared in the Central Church of the Empire in the Northern Territory." --- "Vatican Tsangang Missionary Handbook" page 1098<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expelled the Black Dragon Dandong, causing this symbolic wrath of the king to fall into the territory of the White Rose, praised by countless bards, historians speculate, but the slightly funny truth is told by herself in the latest chapter, It was revealed: "Probably the king who symbolizes anger is not willing to take out a small dragonfly and make a pair of glasses for a human being." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Byzantine Holy Land Holy Pope:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever Apostle Head White Emperor, God's Spokesperson. Human spiritual beliefs. The Pope has no paradox. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3Saint Jerome:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial Warlock. The great master of arcaneism, the most important founder of arcane theory. Constructed the Pan God Palace in the field of magic. "He is the most important founder of the modern epic of the epic continent. It is the most important, not one of them. It is this sage that makes the arcane finally get rid of the status of a prostitute in the magic field. A fully independent symbolic figure, the first ever founder of the great arcane system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first epic continent to become a black peach head card Arcanist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4Saxon:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black emperor, the apostle of the devil, the greatest heresy of the mainland. From the Orkal Empire, the ordinary noble Teutonic family, under the command of the Byzantine sectarian philosopher Massa Yadun, possesses meticulous logic, profound knowledge and almost invulnerable debate skills, and is known as the "invincible doctor." Later, due to opposition to the papal power, the church was supposed to be separated from the royal power. The church should only master religious affairs, care about "soul salvation", should not interfere with secular regimes, and be declared "heretical" by the Byzantine. He escaped on the way to the final conviction of the religious trial and came to the Kaya Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5King Queen:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Box Q. Shocking the entire sacred continent with bloody means, 弑The father took the cold-blooded butcher who killed a dozen brothers and sisters in one breath and was tried by the Holy See as a devil of great heresy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She does not follow the common sense to promote universal education, from the few imperial finances, a large amount of tax is deducted to pay all The entrance fee for children is arrogant in the eyes of an epic mainland history observer. "The empire stood at the peak of the mainland a hundred years later, and it was decided as early as today's desk." The deceased finance minister did not dare to say anything. Immediately afterwards, she personally led a two-kilometer iron ride to level a medium-sized duchy known as a regular knight with a total number of 20,000. The reason is simple. The nobles of the Principality have raised a large number of unscrupulous businessmen and bounty hunters. The young girl of the empire, the Queen personally cut his head in the palace, the headless body was exposed, it seems that she can not remember this is the first few, self-deprecating will always help people count. After a while, by her The money-funded fleet and the Holy Empire discovered the New World almost at the same time. She personally named the British Isles chain, in order to compete for the entire ownership of the New World in her view, unabashedly arranged in the southern part of the empire. An elite army.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queen has almost passed through all corners of the Empire after she ascended the throne. She will walk with the knight in the cold and icy ice, A few times or even a walk. I will walk into the classroom to teach the children, tell the story of the legendary empire, tell them that the bow on the desk can raise the pride of the future for the empire. She will step into the slums and eat with the elderly. The roughest food, the cheapest and strongest warm-up Soviet shochu. Moreover, she not only has a shocking iron fist, but also makes the epic continent no longer sell the card population, she also brought a huge surplus trade to the empire. And a few trophies that were clean and neat after the ridiculous war, and those who defeated the country far more powerful than the singular knights did not flow into the aristocratic sac, but distributed to the empire within her strict supervision. The warriors with the most enemies, even if they do not have a noble title, even if many of them are too old to be able to rush to the battlefield of the gongs and drums, there are many old people in these years. Wearing a beautiful armor that has not been worn for a lifetime, and dying, and the younger generations do not bring the armor into the grave, but strip it, put it on, continue to fight for the empire, and raise the weapon for the queen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has an unparalleled forward-looking support for the marine industry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a single dragon tooth Amier shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6Zhubite the Great:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Box J. Holy Emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silent master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only time to show up is to watch the fallen heroes in the glorious hills of the Empire heroes through more than 100 coffins through Caesars Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first wise monarch to raise the commerce to the glory of the Empire, and opened a door for the civilians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Never participate in various summit meetings of the epic continent, the invasion and division of the Principality of the White Rose, the Exploratory Council of the largest Dragon Veins of St. Megan, on the Senate Islands Defining the affiliation, even for the five-person round table on the five-year strategy for the Muse mainland, the most taciturn middle-aged man on the mainland did not attend, but no one denied that he was the most in charge of the empire. The king of the results. Since the throne, Judit has spurred all the princes of the Otis to the periphery of the core circle, and the most turbulent eastern aristocratic circle of the empire has become a luxury, in the most prone to turbulent new and old In the alternation of the patriarch, the Archbishop of Vatican, who was closest to Jubit, received the patriarch's scepter, and a large number of military aristocrats like Pompeii and Greenspan emerged, like the sissy Helen. The alternative families who could not stand in the Imperial Capital also had a bright future. They swallowed the territory and voice of the old aristocrats. The Ministry of the Holy See was separated from the monarchy. Basically, no one has the courage to question the authority of His Majesty, especially the central system of Vatican, and the Academic Affairs Office is becoming more and more like the affiliated administration of the Empire."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 Duke of Rothschild: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred empire of the high family of the family of the Rotongschild family.

The 13 families of the long-lived species, the Setters, are rooted in the Titan Empire, and they believe in God of War with the son of the god of war, and slightly The Mora family who received a little bath of God's kindness chose to be God's servant, and the other 11 families all chose to avenge God. The birth of this baby girl caused a huge panic in the whole world of longevity, which is more than the three holy objects. Entering the Pope's Hall, it is necessary to let any lecch feel desperate. The Setters family council decided to raise her. The Judah meeting immediately responded by depriving the senior members of the Setters family of membership. Next, five years later. After a long period of temptation and contact, Judah finally dispatched the deputy speaker, Prince Quinn, the patriarch of the Gandhi Hughes family, who led a delegation of 11 elders to choose and worship the right hand of the Austrian Holy See, the Pope. Hall, the conclusion of the peach Brand secret ", and then began strangling Sete Si <br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;This filthy war lasted for 20 years, and the powerful Sutters, who once occupied a third of the seat in the Judah Council, died in dignity and blood in the conspiracy and blood, except for the two elders who were permanently sleeping in the Dragon Peak. And an abyss of the Sun Island Trench, the elders of the five generations of Setters were all dying. Dimit was only a young aristocrat who won the title of Marquis because of his father. He was tortured by the damn Gandhiius family for more than two hundred years. As a gift to Augustine, from the choice of allegiance to Luo Tong Chaid, Dimit began its revenge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final end of the baby girl: It is said that it was captured by the Mora family, and the patriarchs of the 11 families divided her. It was a very cute little girl who spent a carefree childhood in Setters, her smile is like the sun. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Sacred Head:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy Spears Shield: The Cornerstone of the Heresy Awards" The founder of the "faith point". Before entering the Vatican's sacred ministry, it is only a half step away from the Byzantine Pope's throne, a sleeping dragon.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp  ; Teton priest: the leader of the night watch. Talented when young. The current owner of the Windsor family. The only one in the Golden Trident who does not resist natural aging and death. A lifetime of love for his wife, a country girl of the Titan Empire. For the rest of his life, he is committed to resurrecting his wife.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hai Ji adults:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother of the black sheep Female. Very neurotic superior.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Six Great Knights of the Holy Empire (only known as 4):<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lafayette: The second empire of the Empire, the emperor of Judit, from the Cavaliers.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dean of Imperial Morgan Knights College: The Third Knight of the Empire. Low-key and Convergence, but in the hands of the future of the empire.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guligly: the sixth knight of the empire, the white robe silver gun, the most handsome knight. Ten years of challenges The five great knights of the empire are unbeaten. It seems that cynicism is full of cynicism. In the castle of Bossan, the uncle of the blacksmith easily solved the revenge of Foucault against the Rotongschild family. But please don’t be on those books. The reputation is confusing, he, sure, must, is definitely a knight. Choose a rare knight source of love.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monofati: Archbishop of the Eastern Empire of the Empire, the oldest man in the Holy See. Proficient in scholastic philosophy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roman Grand Duke: The Protector of the Caucasus Trade Zone, the Emperor of the Skull, has a baby dragon pet, and a half-human half-angeled maid "Little Princess Hemel ". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two major extensions: Byzantine is the religious orthodoxy of the epic continent, and the Vatican’s Holy See is abortion and Byzantine. The Vatican's Holy See must be loyal to the imperial emperor. The former with the same source as the Byzantine church is bound by the teachings and rituals of the ancient St. Stephen's Church, and the "Maniconia Creed" and the first five St. Defen's Guilds The resolutions of the meeting did not make any changes to them to supplement and innovate. One point is especially in stark contrast to the Byzantine Olympiad, who refused to accept the view that the Pope "the Pope has never been paradoxical, always correct"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope is the absolute core of the Byzantine Holy See. "The Pope is never paradoxical, always correct." But the Vatican's patriarch of the Holy Empire is not like the former. In that way, standing in the perfect commanding heights of the spiritual realm, his status is only slightly higher than the Archbishop of Red, and sometimes the Patriarch has to obey the decision made by the ten-member Red Conference. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occupational class<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magician, knight, arcane master, monk, swordsman, bounty Hunter, assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the magician<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. It is a kind of magic union and imperial magic research institute The scarce occupations monopolized by the two giants, and becoming one of them, in addition to having an impressive qualification, still need a lot of money, although the magic unions will set up nuclear purity identification offices in major cities, but the qualifications are not amazing civilians. Children are often rejected from the magic gate. The Magic Association will release limited textbooks in addition to the basic magic principles. High-level magic is often passed down from generation to generation to the next generation. The entire Holy Empire has only two heavily guarded magic. The library, if the private theory of liberation of magic is dismissed from the qualification of the Magic Association, will be sentenced to more than ten years of felony conviction by the Empire, and even the terrorist precedent of the imprisonment of the great magician, showing the strict management of the Magic Union and the Imperial Academy. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magician is like a person standing outside the magic gate with a key, and this key is the nuclear flaw in the human body. There is no elementality in itself, which means that no one is born to be bound to use only one element of magic. A body with a nuclear plaque is a lever. You can use this lever to pick up (dominate) the various elements around it. A powerful magician means that you can extract elements with higher purity and more. One of the defense enchantments is to dilute the surrounding elements to produce a magical vacuum effect. This enchantment is the most thorough, but it also makes It is difficult for the releaser to counterattack in an instant, which is a fatal flaw for the magician who is cherishing the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Mage related:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic Array Wired Magic Array, Magic Powder Magic Array and Entity Magic Array<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cutting the sun cross, the eye of the black sun, the four-star cross star, the ring of Mobius, the heart of Nibelon-root, the thirteen black wings, the Osterrog black me, the Raymond sacrifice square , five-star mans composite multiple cross magic array, Parker Kaiser number magic array, odd-stringed spiral constellation, Kurt Island stone array, Davy Star, Nedland flamingo flower magic array, Mazugo blue purification chain Array, second dark gold pendulum compound magic array, sacrifice, zodiac, Kafka crown magic array, Scarlett soul elegy, God left eye<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Additional classification: size gamma, variability of small gamma, red gamma, red and black alchemy, dark alchemy, scorpion, shaman, arcane, taboo arcane, dark magic, undead book<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.

This is why the small gamma, or black alchemy, is officially judged as a heresy. In the orthodox official cognition, one needs believers to contribute a portion of the meat - The god of body cost is a god of injustice, and it is the "wolf of the sheepskin, which is another kind of devil" recorded in the Bible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undead Mage: The undead magician, a dark group chased by a person who believes in light, is thrown into the dead and decaying dark magic as a human being, thinking To gain strength from the death of the biggest Dharmic sword in human heads, death, the ultimate ambition is to obtain "eternal life." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infamous "Grey Nest" in the history of Black Magic: Or called "Satan's Counter", the number of filaments, the highest record by history Created by Emperor Feng-Charlemagne, the exact number is 861. The Emperor’s emperor came to the most prosperous Wangcheng border of the Gorse dynasty without any warning in the panic era when the Byzantine Christian Church had just begun to expel all the gray areas. Separately, quickly, personally created a human tragedy that controlled the half-Vipolin Knights to slaughter the other half of the Violet. One hand removed the most beautiful left wing of the gorse. After hiding for half a century, von Charlemagne finally passively pursued his Papal Hall with a lot of human and financial resources. Before being convicted, the Archbishop of Red asked his motives.

The most amazing thing is that these are The imprisonment is not a dead thing, but also needs to eat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level setting of the epic sergeant is very unique and very interesting. Similar to the human aristocracy, it has a total of 7 levels. The Green Baron, Huang Zijue, Black Earl, Blue Marquis, Red Duke, and the last top prince, as for the world's most sacred priests, will have a special name, epic mainland generally every half century There will be a singular emperor with the same talent and luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaman Master: Shaman has always been far ahead of other black magic in the *soul field, even the most authoritative alchemy of the epic continent, can not be compared with it <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black magician:? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Gamma Warlock:? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priest Minister:? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maya Bright Festival:? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4, Level Skills<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level: Each sorcerer has different ranks in the Holy Empire Symbolic badge, low-order is perennial grass, middle-order is purple lily flower, high-order is sword daisy, each order has three "bits", such as a purple lily flower badge is the first position, three petals are on - Bit. On the high level, there is also a large magician wearing a six-petal tulip badge, and a magic sage of the black orchid badge. The gold clover badge does not represent the order, but the royal magic association's award to the court magician. The royal family specially issued the Shamrock Diamond Badge to the Merciful Sorcerer. The Maya Snow Mountain Temple is a sacred object that the Imperial Magician is fascinated with than the Black Orchid Badge and the Gold Clover Badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden robes:? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Robe Magister:? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician who can peep into the laws of space is hailed as the Maya white robes who have stepped into the magical temple,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;'圣穹'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic level that he can use increases by 5 levels for each level of the magician level, but Damn marginal degressive efficiency, the 20th-level Royal Society Wizard, without a top-level scroll or a similar epic wand, often driving a level 80 magic is his limit<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The temple screens out ten sages in the whole mainland every five years.

Even dark gold material, but it requires a rather complex and difficult exercise singing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main feature of the Dark Gold sequence element is the ability to break the elemental composition of the Entity Magic. In addition, it cuts the skin, even if there is an Arcane's healing totem Halo blessing, can only heal slowly<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related places: Mayan temple, dark towers<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the knight<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secular state and the Vatican Tingang Holy See are two houses of God in the world, the emperor and the head of the past are the representatives of the two rooms, the knight It is the battle to protect these two houses. They fight for honor and fight for faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification: The Golden Wool Templar of the Holy Glory Knight, the Knight of the Royal Knights<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The chief knight of the empire was not known to the world, and some described him as a sacred ghost on the sacred empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second empire of the empire, Lafayette, is the priest of the priests of Judit, always following the leader of the sacred empire, and has never heard of assassinations in these years. And the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third knight is the "cradle of imperial talent" - the dean of Imperial College, low-key and introverted, but in his hands dominates the future of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth empire of the empire, Gugligli, hits a snowy white, a clear silver gun, and challenges the five major knights of the empire in ten years, unbeaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights: The Holy Empire once had three great knights, including the thirteenth of the thirteenth daisy knights.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy See, the golden armor that has been blessed and baptized, is as bright as the sun, with a triangular Holy See sign. The number of glory knights in the Holy See is 40,000. Although it is more than twice as much as the former, the combat strength is not as good as the former. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third Knights are the once very gorgeous Black Rose Knights, and the black roses that bloomed after the end of the Dusk Basin completely withered, with a tragic attitude The stage of the sacred empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of the Imperial Knights under the sacred Principality of the Sixth and Sixth Houses is the true "Knight of the Lord", and its total number of people has always been maintained. In 293, unless a knight is killed or expelled, the prince does not want to enter the Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Northwestern Diocese of the Three Crosses of the Knights of the Knights<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Byzantine Holy Cross and the Knights Templar <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Holy Hall? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Gordon of the Royal Knights of the Knights of the Knights,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Titan Empire' God of War's whip or the whip of God. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kami empire ‘Odin right eye’<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Riders of one of the two great Knights of the Empire? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Nose Knights "Little Tom"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third imperial court of the Imperial Academy ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest number of Sparrow Knights in the Academic Affairs Office? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenspan Family Black Knights<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd Family Red Heart Lions Knights<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classification: The general order of the Cavaliers is nine, divided into high school junior high "order", each level has upper, middle and lower "bits". In addition to the nine-level general order (this sequence is more accurate as a cavalry, not a knight), the knight also has a silver shield knight, a grand court knight and a holy knight, the sacrificial knight died. After that, he will be buried in the hillside on the north side of the Temple of Ork, known as the "Knight's Graveyard." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher level knights in the 10th to 13th order of level 9 and above, the 1st to 3rd Bax medals issued by the Empire. As for the empire-like empire, the six great knights are known as "Holy Knights", and they are monsters of around 20 levels, and they are disdainful of any medals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength has reached the court dragon knight level is only certified by the big knight? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gift: The ability of love in the source of faith can often have an affiliated belief above the level of the Haiping line of faith, which is a high coefficient of personal loyalty and individuality. Glory, because of the fragility of love, their mature path is often slower than the choice of knights with many religions such as religion and family. Once mature and strong, this vein is called by the bard as a member of the "Violet" knight. The holy knight is closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honour in honor, honor is one of the eight systems, she chose to follow Augustine after the fall of the two faiths of justice and sacrifice, majoring in the family of the loyalty of the main system Abandoning any minors means that the higher her future class, the higher her loyalty to Rotong Childe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honours, Loyalty, and the love chosen by Grand Knight Descartes are the most popular sources of faith in the main system, and should have been absolutely in absolute numbers under the illumination of the Holy See. The piousness of the superiority is extremely bleak, even though the great knights in the Knights of the Holy See are often symbolic minors, and the pious knights are the rarest "fools" on the list of the Imperial Knights, which has always been the leader of the Holy See. We are very worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clever aristocrat will not take the initiative to ask his nephew to supplement love under the premise of major family loyalty. After all, the two are too prone to violent conflicts. Once they deviate from the family of their loved ones, they may directly destroy The main faith of the knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saxon rides the right to choose the honor of the main source of honor, with the sacrifice of the auxiliary war<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revenge<虔 < br br br br br br br br The behavior will whipping the inner soul according to the standard of saints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, Arcane Master?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell: Bloom, Cross, Healing Totem, Stagnant Arcane <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seal is a very important branch of the arcane system. In a wide variety of spells, the seal is a "magic prostitute". The arcane is proud of all other spell-like skills. Capital, the well-deserved giant of the Arcane, is equal to the elements of the magical world or the books of the dead in the dark magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four, monks?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican’s gods are divided into black and white, Among them, there are monks, monks, monks, monks, priests, monks, bishops, archbishops, and archbishops and the spokespersons of God on the land. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different from the black gods that must be abstinent in life, the former can enjoy more autonomy, a total of seven gods, from the bottom up to the chanting, The auxiliary auxiliary, the auxiliary sacrifice, the big auxiliary sacrifice, the priest, the big priest and the highest priest, but the white god is destined to be the head of the past life. In fact, the Vatican’s Holy See has only one white priest in the last two hundred years. Long eventually climbed the throne of the Archbishop of Red, but still sealed after death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,Swordsman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general order of the swordsman is nine, divided into high school Three "orders", each of which has upper, middle and lower "bits". In addition to the nine-level general order, there are swordsmen, swordsmen and samurai on the swordsman, but there will be a mysterious division in the field of Juggernaut. Everyone who is promoted to the Juggernaut will use the sword personally. I engraved my name on the "Mughal Stone" in the Temple of the Battle of Minos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, bounty hunter?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first purpose: "As long as there are prey, the hunter has no reason to rest. As long as you have enough gold coins, we will hunt for you. The entire continent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objective "Bounty hunters never know their employer status."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;七、 Assassin<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with some ethnic and professional oaths:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkening Wizard: Agile and strong, carrying longbows, they turned away from the original goddess of forest, and she was one of the twelve gods of Mount Olympia. She did not abandon these descendants who broke into the abyss. They still lived long and voluntarily, with human beings. The accuracy that archers can't match. Before the war, they used to meditation in the mouth of "the breath is still alive, not to sail." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood gnome, "the bloodthirsty dwarf", the malformed product of human black magic and sax shaman, possessing metamorphosis and multiplication, even the greatest of the gods The darling - humans can not compare, they have set off a "relief" on the Muse mainland until the midgod held the highest meeting to suppress the plague. They have no moral bottom line. Once they are hungry, they can eat any flesh-and-blood creatures, including the most direct blood relatives. No one wants to watch the bloody gnome's "dining." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Werewolf: Once a race with the vampire in the Dark Throne, it was expelled by the conspiracy of humans and vampires. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the day of the full moon, I will rise and bring a shudder!" This is the ancient vow of the Werewolf's inheritance of the millennium. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orc: "They must step on the bones and board the glory of the throne that belongs to me!" This is the fertile ambition of the half-orcs with superior strength but low status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the phrase "Justice! Loyalty! Honor!" is the common declaration of all the knights of the epic continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1, Holy See <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican and the Byzantine Holy See: with the highest court and The Holy Ghost Academy has six departments of the Faith Theory Department, the Bishops' Department, the Sacramental Etiquette Department, the Privilege List, the Sect and the Secular Group Management Department, and the Department of the People's Republic of China. Among them, the Faith Theory Department? These are the official definitions of religious trials and heretical rulings. There is also a pivotal group on the six saints of the two houses, and there are three secretariats and nine offices underneath. The main spiritual beliefs on the epic continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high-ranking arcane sects of the sacred sects of the sacred priests, the sorcerers of the sacred sorcerers, and the sorcerers of the sacred sorcerers, who are called "white shepherds" by the Holy See.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The four pillars of the Holy See are the most conceited, the most luxurious sacred armor, the most beautiful sword, and the best thoroughbred horses. These are their arrogant capital; the lowest is the night watchman. A black robe cloak reveals only red gloves to let outsiders know the difference between them and heresy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three great dark giants in charge of the Holy Spirit ruling hall of the Great Shields Extreme Hatred Templars, the other two are the white robes of the Patriarch The shepherd dog snorted, the Knights Templar is the only parish organization (but has been hostile to the order)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Sacred: Byzant in the mainland "the father of the spirit" The Austrian Holy See is called the Pope’s Judgment Hall, and the Vatican’s Holy See is called the heretical ruling.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Justice of the Olympian Religious Trial, Vatican Rantigan's ruling ruling by the ruling of the Holy See ruling<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heresy ruling, the Vatican’s heresy, the three giants Levi’s, Teutonic and Haiji led the ruling The Holy Spirit ruling tribunal, the night watchman organization and the "Ewe" three institutions (Osgoodin's order is the fourth institution)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The official missionary of the Vatican Tegang, 'Ruuf', is responsible for opening up the unknown and uncivilized areas of the epic continent for the Holy See. The superintendent is the greatest white. 'Lue Fu'. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nightwatch of the heresy ruling, it is the complex-body of the Vatican’s Red Gloves Night Watcher and 'Black Rouge', this dark profession The lesson is that 'there is a corner where there is darkness, and there is our footprint.' The night watcher not only wants to eradicate heresy, but also fights with various orcs that infiltrate the empire, and may also fight against the secret institutions of the Papal Hall of the Byzantine Need to wander around the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Night Watcher: The most special Lesson 13 of the Vatican in the Vatican, surrounded by a spacious black cloak, different from the White of the Vatican Triangular sacred logo, red gloves, embroidered with a half-moon scythe on the back of the glove, the armband is a bright red cumbersome multi-crossed<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is darker than heresy In the collective there are contractors who sign contracts with young sacred beasts or certain necrotic creatures, knights or swordsmen whose body is replaced by magical machinery, old priests who know all kinds of black magic and ancient spells, and even some births. Children who have certain taboo strengths, in the heresy ruling, every time you see a heresy, you have often seen three priests who are more absurd than heretics - the night watchman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Gloves Issuer<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Gloves: Both sides of the face are painted with a sacred triangle of magical symbols<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Black Gloves, such members are hidden behind the first line<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ewe" is known for its in-depth research in various fields, only entrusted to the ewe The "eyes" of the most *-long deciphering spells in the organization are different from the horns that focus on living experiments on various types of organisms. The sheep's eyes are more proficient in various texts and symbols.<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Pope's religious ruling, the giant has supreme dark power, such as "salvation" or "purification" of any heresy according to the principle of proximity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inquisition is undoubtedly a powerful institution in the Vatican’s Holy See that is the most unconstrained by the framework and norms. It has many privileges to envy the nobles and the remaining organizations of the Holy See. , for example, trial and ruling, purification, and the redemption of the exclusive consul.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican’s Holy Trinity gesture, but the Holy Cross of the Holy See <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, small organization?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Church: The Church of Prairie as the Byzantine One of the six sects is the largest branch of the Holy See in the sacred empire, and Dimit tells him that there is a secret institution similar to a religious trial in the Priest. Called the "Dark Apostle." Unlike the tens of thousands of members of religious trials and heretical rulings, this institution has only seven members permanently, four elders plus three "apostles" who walk in the dark, one of which is called 'cutting ''<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domingo is a retreat that believes in the teachings of the Holy See, but on the point that the Pope has no paradox, that is, the Pope’s correct authority Publicly questioned, Domingo did not receive formal recognition in the two major churches of Byzantine and Vatican, and the generous support of King Elizabeth Eliot VIII to it became an important factor for many powerful countries to seek the Principality. According to the Westminster Campaign and the subsequent signing of the Westernong Treaty, the Principality of the White Rose was jointly supervised by the four victorious gorse, Titan, Holy Empire and Liberty City Thatcher, Domingo The retreat has also become a heresy organization. Over the years, Bai Weiwei has become the fiercest battlefield between the two churches, the Pope's Hall and the Ministry of the Holy See. The two sides constantly transported fresh blood and smashed it in a strange land. Both the Holy See refused Recognize white rose far more than the number of deaths each member of the disgraceful fact that the Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neutral: 'The Song of Roland' Secret Swordsman Association 13 Swordsman<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World Customs: Titan Empire, 'Herman Wolf Group'<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Army Urkushi Force<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Academy of Magic specializes in cultivating the mysterious institution of the genius "Torch"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, heresy organization?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;血族十三(十二)支<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gandessius family:? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sutters family:? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Makawi, is said to be a mentally deficient blood, except crazy or crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goverlyn family:? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;忒莫瑞尔, there is no more disgusting race in the world. A group of dark magical human black magicians gave up their human identity and chose to stay in the night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bodies are shrouded in black robes, revealing only a pair of flesh-and-blooded hands, and the pale face, each member has a cross on his forehead Patterns, their fangs are different from the snow white of the ordinary blood, but a kind of bright red, as if always contaminated with blood, this is a group of enchanting aliens with both vampire characteristics and human undead master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nose-colored Vedic, this is an ugly race that has been cursed by the goddess of life, they have lost the form that God has given to humanity, even in this race. Elders can't have the beauty of being with angels. They don't have castles, wandering in graves, sewers, and various dark houses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the two sharp fangs and pale complexion that fits the characteristics of a bloody family, almost no one wants to classify this creature into a vampire race. It is a giant alien with a superb body. For example, the wolf's sharp and slender claws are forked with a few moles that have been removed from the soil. One is stuffed into the mouth and the blood is splashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Xi Tuo: Bai Weiwei Dynasty royal pet, feeding the werewolf<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Byron family:? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mora Family:? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licensing", action instructions for vampire elite troops<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supreme organization Judah Council<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apoldeti Wolf:? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaman:midgod<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savior: One of the three great heresy<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sage: Maybe it’s as pure and powerful as the Judas parliament that controls most of the underground world’s forces, but it’s one of the most hated heresies in Vatican, and the sage is called all together. The dark species at the top of all food chains in the mainland, the almost immortal dark monarch lecch, the wolf who permanently lost their homeland, the half-orcs who are not recognized by humans and rejected by the Muse, the elves that are metamorphosed, are not as popular as the golden subspecies.

It is not a vulgar jewel, not a rare porcelain, not a heretical specimen that is rejected by the orthodox, but an apostolic playing card that has always become the biggest puzzle of the epic continent<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a total of 55 cards, the red heart symbolizes the war with blood, the spades represent deep wisdom, the plums mean peace and women, the squares are power, each color has 13 cards, ten letters plus The last three head cards, the red letter cards painted with the most war-torn large army or the Knights' badge on the mainland, occupy the most seats with the Titan Empire. Plum blossoms have the most famous symbols of every seminary and monastery, and the Holy Empire has no doubt that the next apostolic poker will be added to the air monastery. J, Q, K, each of the four colors has three head cards, a total of twelve, painted with the characters on the epic continent standing on the peak. Plus the last three, the apex of heresy: the black emperor; the father of the spirit of the mainland: the white emperor; and the queen who would be blank if the candidate was vacant<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apostle The replacement of playing cards has changed in the past 20 years. The most recent one was in the 821th year of the Holy Calendar. In that year, the emperor of the Holy Empire returned to the square head after two hundred years, and the white emperor, the white emperor of the thousand years, was worshipped by the Pope. The "razor theologian" Saxon, who was judged to be heretic, fled to the Camry Empire and became the newest black emperor. The Queen of the Card, after smashing dozens of royal members with the same blood relationship in one breath, became a box Q, one higher than Jupiter the Great J. Still in the white rose dynasty of the spades, her emperor's majesty was completely abandoned by the apostle's playing cards. The young emperor who was scared to hide in the quilt by the singer was screaming and thundering. Even the white rose aristocrats were scornful and had to worry about the future of the dynasty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After each of the apostles’ cards is finalized, they will be sent to the Mayan Temple, the Sun God Altar, the Golden Island and the Byzantine Holy See. It started to be released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin has a special case:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different from the end of the epic continent that year Version, because it is only 54 in an unprecedented way. According to the fragment, the original version of the playing card showed the overlap between the two emperors and the empress. The most stunned version of Augustin was the version in the labyrinth box, which was given by the magic teacher in his arms. The heads of the people are exactly the same, the drawing, and the materials are exactly the same. The debris is a rough description of a secret that is difficult to be verified by future generations. The Golden Island and the Sun God altar first recognized this unruly playing card, but the Mayan Temple and the Byzantine Holy See were rejected, and the final four sets were finally rejected. They were all sealed up, destroyed, or lost. I don’t know why. The Pompeii family got a complete set of what was called a valueless city, and then Nello transferred it to Augustine, the next four decades of playing cards. The empress has always been a blank head card. Is it the makers who are "ghosted" with the spiritual father of the magical holy place Maya and the whole continent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
