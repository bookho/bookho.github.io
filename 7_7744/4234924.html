			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 33 Awakening<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Knights worked hard in the Black Swan Lake day and night, the most The low-ranking knights who have just got rid of slavery are depressed because they don’t know what they are doing, but they build some strange buildings according to the requirements of the deputy head Philip. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the beautiful leader with two girls is drawing lines on the ground all day long, but they have seen Elizabeth’s summoning a legendary "Dragon", Ares with the possession of the God of War also made them fearful and fearful, and did not dare to slap the true identity of the young master behind the scenes. This scenic manor is no better than Lolita in their view. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippine promoted by Augustine to the Cavaliers No. 2 urged his men to work hard, except for the necessary rest and sleep and drinking water for two periods, the rest were He crushed it and successfully converted it into a building on the drawing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fei Li himself does not know what the mysterious owner wants to create, if the castle can not be so scattered, but if it is a magical array, It is unlikely that it will be so grand and spectacular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before he became a slave, Philippe was a singer of the Marquis, and he also learned some basic knowledge of magic, knowing the magical array as a magical silver branch. The larger the scale, the more complicated the lines, the higher the requirements for the caster's nuclear weapons, and the famous large magical array in history is used by the magic union to summon the saints inhabiting heaven or the abyss from the dark plane. Species. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fei Li is looking forward to the day when the building is finished, after all, there is sweat everywhere in almost every part of the building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, Alice stood on the edge of the Black Swan Lake and did not let the luxury carriage drive straight in because she saw a simple stone monument with a similar epitaph The words of Ming: The saints sleep here, please temporarily put away your arrogance, anger, jealousy, laziness, greed, bulimia and lust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She walked behind the stone tablet and found a line of words, "Three things will make the Empire a supreme great kingdom in a hundred years: "The Wealth of Nations" , "Teaching" and aster flowers. - Devoted Augustine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred empire has been particularly favored for economics for nearly a hundred years. In 120 years ago, the Magnolia, who wrote the "The Wealth of Nations" in the Gorse Dynasty, died of loneliness and loneliness. One day after his death, one day, "The Wealth of Nations" appeared on the pillow of the sacred empire, Nicholas VII. Today, most scholars and empire people think that half a century ago, it was not "the pride of the Benedictine family." General Clemens defeated the best military genius of the gorse in the past three hundred years. Prince Rilde is the "national wealth theory" to let the sacred empire find a shortcut to rise and become one of the richest kingdoms on the epic continent, which makes the sacred empire defeated. The plot of the madman Prince Lille was able to resist a wave of offensives in the subsequent Titan Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The learned Alice squats and rubs the stone inscriptions, whispering: "The unsuccessful Magnus is unexpected at the end of the rigorous "The Wealth of Nations" The ground used a poetic and emotional statement - gold coins are the father of love, gold coins are the mother of war."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personal butler Asa smiled: "Miss, It is said that every member of the Helen family is required to recite the "National Wealth Theory". I think Greenspan can also try it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice shook his head: Greenspan, who will recite the "The Wealth of Nations", can no longer be the invincible barbarian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, the Grand Executive, invites you to The underground castle of Poetry, let me lead the way.” Hera Bolsefele appeared behind Alice and Asa. She just got news from Agatha, and Augustine asked her to lead two Greenspan guests. Go downstairs to visit. She personally has no good feelings for Greenspan. After all, only a few hundred thousand gold coins will become a plaything for a certain barbarian heir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you for your guidance." Alice's aristocratic lady etiquette is impeccable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hella looked cold and went straight to the poetry brother castle, but there was some sorrow in the bottom of my heart. This is probably a huge gap between a female heresy and an empire celebrity. It is an insurmountable gap. Even if she now gives Hera an aristocratic title and throws it into a big family for cramming training, she can't breed the temperament of a socialite. She is only suitable for the battlefield and is suitable for horseback. In this regard, the big arcanes who walked in front had only a little regret, no regrets were born in Saxon Forest, and no regrets to become "the daughter of Zeus." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss Hera, are you already a big ruling officer from the Cavaliers?" Alice asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the Knight of the Rotong Chald family," Hera corrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Asa, is there a big difference here?" Alice asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss, for middle and low-ranking knights, majoring in loyalty, being loyal to the family or loyal to a certain individual, the gap is not large, but level 9 The difference between the big knight and the central knight above level 15 is obvious. In short, Miss Hera has chosen family loyalty." The old housekeeper explained patiently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since this is the case, then she must have no minor love. She is just a knight who chooses to believe in sable flowers." Alice smiled, though she has done It’s better to compete with her female for the psychological preparation of the young Augustine, but she really does not want to compete with Hera Bolsefele, it will be a deformed game with too many asymmetry, not in line with Alice’s aesthetic. View. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler smiled and nodded, thanking God for giving the barbarian a smart brain. The only fly in the ointment is that this brain is not a male. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin left the ground floor, let the channel open and shout Going to command Hera to lead the way, Elizabeth walked to the coffin and opened the coffin cover. It was still the dry skeleton of the long-lived servant Dimit. The only dazzling thing was the heart of the scarlet saints in the left and right chests. It was full of life and Elizabeth picked up. Heel, spread a hand, then the other hand stretched out a finger, cut the palm of your hand with your nails, blood flowing into the coffin, a drop of inhalation of the prince-level lecch body, and then the heart of the saints began to violently beat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong darkness spurts out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red blood is all over the bones, and then the flesh grows at an alarming rate visible to the naked eye, growing to fullness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dimit's Gothic beauty is as beautiful as the face of the most elegant aristocrat in human history, Elizabeth finally stopped the blood sacrifice, her pale face Looking at the powerful lecch that suddenly opened his eyes, regret: "Dear long-lived friends can only forcibly disturb your sleep, because your young impulsive and stubborn paranoid master is ready to gamble with life and gamble on him. Whether the luck at one time is still above the standard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
