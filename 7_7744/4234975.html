			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin prevented the Lich King’s violent signs, indicating that Fiona went to the Pope’s antique shop alone, and he looked at the two beautiful tourists, one The humpback old man, dressed in an uncommon costume in the empire, looks plain and shabby. Standing next to him is a strong woman who is more prominent in the old man's skinny. He is hidden in a large black robe, but his face is not beautiful, but there is a pair of eyes. The silver-white scorpion, the center of the forehead, is engraved with a strange pattern and a rune, such as a craft sculpture, lifeless. Augustine smiled and explained: "That is not the ambition of a common monk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperament is not honorable, but some wretched old man smiled: "Young man, mind Spend a few Bourbon silver coins, ask a long-distance old man to smoke a roll of tobacco? This stuff, if you don’t smoke for a few days, it’s uncomfortable.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine licked his pocket and smiled. "There are just a few silver coins in your body. As long as you don't mind me, this poor man can only ask you to take a few rolls of the cheapest tobacco."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man laughed and showed a yellow tooth that happened to lack the front teeth. It looked funny and happy: "If the Holy Empire is as hospitable as your young monk, many problems are not difficult. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone is not the old man of the imperial people, the mysterious maid. Augustine, the "Wuke" of the Lich King who was alert to the old man. Together, I came to an elegant bookstore on the riverside. Augustine picked a window on the second floor and asked for two cups of black tea and three rolls of the cheapest tobacco in the store. These two luxury items that were popular in the Empire for nearly 50 years came from The distant Peacock Dynasty, loaded with porcelain and shipping, the old man is not polite, burning matches, smoking tobacco, deeply sucked, full of intoxication, Augustine has no preference for such a top ten nobility Interest, just slowly drinking black tea, looking out to the quiet scenery outside the window, Chandily apparently does not welcome a ruleless destroyer, many old magicians are angry and screaming, and this little bastard tainted the last pure land of Alpha City. I believe that many letters of the seal have been sent to the desk of the Emperor. Augustine sat down on the stairs shelf and pulled out a "White Wall of Zeppelin" about the history of magic, and flipped it through. The old man yelled at the free tobacco, the best thing in the world, after all, it was a free thing. He took a roll of tobacco, spit out the last smoke circle, and finally broke the silence. "Hospital young people, you are not surprised me. Who is it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stopped reading and looked up and smiled: “It’s very curious, but I’m not sure if I asked, you’re willing to say the answer. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man rolled his eyes. "A familiar aristocratic tone. If there were not two rolls of tobacco on the table, I had already patted my butt and left."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine thought for a moment, shouting to the bookstore owner, signed a sum of money for the finest tobacco, the boss saw the name with Luo Tongchaide, his face changed dramatically, he immediately fled with a bill, and told the servant to take a roll of treasure. The best tobacco, the old man saw the excellent quality of the tobacco at a glance, the eyes lit up, immediately eager to ignite, take a deep breath, stunned, sneer: "Now you are jealous of me, I will not leave. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shook his head and joked: "For a distant guest from the Caucasus, I can't be embarrassed, because the entire epic continent knows that the Caucasus has one of the most The short-term asylum seeker."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man grinned: "Young man, are you saying that old Rome is the old man? You must have read more boring books. Or listen to the bard of the bard, this group relies on the pen The guy who cheated the money with the mouth has never been to the ghost place of the Caucasus. Old Rome only likes to watch the big ass of the young lady, round and round, just like your followers. The Caucasian who said he is good, either from Successful businessmen who swindle gold coins in the trade zone are either foreign bankers who are more blood-sucking than vampires,"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shook his head and said: "I have been to the Caucasus and stayed. For the first half of the year, the Roman Grand Duke is indeed a qualified kingdom gatekeeper. The tramp will not lie, and who will let them fill their stomachs, they will say who's good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine is more and more curious about the old man in front of him, the accent of a Caucasian inhabitant, and dare to say that the bad words of the old Roman Grand Duke are rejected by the old aristocrats? The old man who was busy fighting tobacco took a look at the viscount standing behind Augustin and said happily: "Young people, I probably guessed your identity. The rumored rumor of the empire is the little Oggs Song City. The bastard, or the executioner in the night watchman, is different. I am in a hurry to come to the Holy Empire, just to find you. First, can you let your dark servant come out of the darkness? You see, I have not hidden you. Anyone who is older, like my old man, likes to see something new."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine smiled and nodded. Dimit, who has the heart of the saint and is not afraid of the sun, floats in the corner and converges on the batwing, which is no different from the ordinary human aristocracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man said: "Poor Sutters has finally welcomed the new Prince. The 11 races awaiting trial must not like this fact."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine suppressed the shock in his heart. If the initial dialogue, the old man only showed a certain degree of rich experience, then now easily feel the atmosphere of Dimit, and casually tell the inside story of the longevity, Augustine has been tightening the body is even more Do not dare to relax. He has too many enemies and is good at wearing eccentric masks. Moreover, this old man can still call the Roman Grand Duke as a bad old man and evaluate Sutters as a poor mysterious guy. If Augustine didn't have the Lich King and Dimit to do the work with him, he would never dare to sit across the old man with ease. This kind of unknown feeling is uncomfortable. The strong maid behind the old man said a string of vocabulary words. The old man listened to him and looked at Augustine. He said: "Hemel said that you have a familiar taste on him. It seems that the holy fall of St. Urban is a fact, not a A lost aristocrat in order to raise the price to fool the little tricks of Jupiter. Young people, you are the second guy in your empire except the old rogue of Jerome, the second guy that surprised me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin grabbed the black tea that almost squirted his mouth. The great master of the Arcanist, the most majestic mountain in the history of the arcane, St. Jerome, will be smashed into old hooligans? In the impression, the teacher of the godfather Iyeta is hard, silent, sublime, and everything has nothing to do with the old hooligans. The only face-to-face conversation between Augustine and the character who boarded the view card was in an unnamed chapel. The old man was simple and peaceful. It was not like an old man with a sacred title. If he should be against this dragon and magic. The world is awe-inspiring, but it should be the same for such elderly people. Of course, in that private conversation, St. Jerome did not get the results he wanted. In the eyes of the old man, he tried to protect a child who lost his family's wings and cultivated a potential young arcane master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin put down the teacup and sighed: "I also guessed your identity, the protector of the Caucasus, the Grand Duke of Rome."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man snapped his finger, and the crumpled face appeared old and not so serious. "Smart little Augustine, then let me just say, you give me this new species. I promise you a condition."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich King who used to be the old Roman worshipper of the new king of the king can't stand being treated as a trader. Full of anger, all kinds of elements raging together, full of swaying jumps and combinations, once the outbreak, the bookstore is estimated to not exist. This time, Augustine did not stop, but the woman behind the old man just read a Gulanlan vocabulary, and it wiped out everything. This time, Augustine, who is good at Guralan, understood it and "dispelled." The Viscount looked horrified. The old man licked his mouth and turned his eyes and said that the current generation is really impatient. It is no wonder that he was made into a duke-level sergeant and finally made someone else. He ignored the fear of the Viscounts, and some reluctantly picked up cheap tobacco and said: "Introduction, Heimer, my little princess, is the official name of the Titan's "monster", to clarify that she is not half an angel and half human. It is two-thirds of an angel, one-third of a human being."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Viscount and Dimit's face were twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled bitterly: "Old Rome, sorry I can't hand you the Viscount, it's a friend's personal belongings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man blinked: "Do you actually reject my kindness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary figure, the demigod behind the Roman Grand Hey, slowly take off the cloak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inexplicable small-scale war has brought Augustine headaches compared to all the enemies on the Black Swan Lake land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Augustine nodded: "Although I don't want to admit it, I have to admit it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man suddenly lowered his voice and said, "Your friend, is a woman?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine nodded, secretly ready to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the power of one person to rival the Roman Empire of the Titan Empire, the odds of winning are infinitely close to zero. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man laughed, and the dignified atmosphere disappeared instantly. He said: "Understood, who is not young?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine finally breathed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Roman grandfather gently said: "The young man who refuses to refuse is not a lovely young man. He will not say no to some shit big men." The young man is not a funny young person. I can live to this day because I refused many seemingly enticing invitations like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustine smiled and said: "It should be that I am like you, I am a young man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man cursed: "It is a hateful aristocratic tone." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin calmly said: "After all, I am from Rotong Childe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man snorted , lost in thought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
