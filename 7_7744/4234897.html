			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(On June 6th, Tenjin is down. The ticket is on ~)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is now The situation is that a person has discovered a huge treasure, but no one can share with him. No worker or subordinate can mine minerals for him. He can only share happiness and suffer alone. Now Augustine doesn't hate the princes who despise him and regard cosmo as a clown. Hatred is also a kind of hard work. The elegant Duchess once said that he has the ability to shelter a green shade and swing with it. Not sure, it is better to move on alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can only wait for those who are obedient. He just immersed himself in 120% sweat to do what he could. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can expect the imperial nobles to do something to add flowers to the crown badge, but never expect them to hand out even a copper plate when they are down. Therefore, Augustine did not stand on the wall of the castle in the poetry brothers. His day is often sneaked into the underground castle after finishing the prayer in the morning, just as rigorous as the Aurora Academy, he first made small The child has a rucksack on Elizabeth's back, puts a dozen pieces of black bread and a few pots of water, and then puts the scorpion Ares with a quill and ink, and of course a large draft wood pulp paper and a new sheepskin roll, because the latter Suitable for long-term storage. He only had a sketch of the underground labyrinth brought from the city of Jubit, only the first floor. His goal is to use two days to draw the complete pattern of the first layer of the poetry brother, correcting and making up the missing and wrong parts, and the fact is that he spent a full three and a half days running the full seat. On the 1st floor, life was boring, and Elizabeth, who was later mad, began to work passively, leaving Augustine and Ares to the bottom of the Swan Lake to enjoy the scenery. Augustine was not embarrassed. Engineers and architects were originally imperial knights and bards. The opposite occupation is a dangerous job that claims to be the top three in the marriage breakdown index. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Augustine was meticulously running the 4th floor of the full underground castle, the time has passed 27 days, with negative 1 and negative 2 layers equal, negative 3 is a The labyrinth in the true sense seems to want to be separated from the bottom of the first and second floors to form a natural barrier that does not require the placement of too many troops. If not, there are two abnormal memories of Ares and Elizabeth, plus Augustine. Carefully engrave the letters with the number attached to each corner, otherwise he will have no choice but to go in and out, so the negative 3 is also the most expensive layer of Augustine's mind. The negative 4th floor is like the second layer of the Black Swan Lake. Surprise him, who can imagine that a large botanical garden can be cultivated in a few tens of meters underground, thanks to the mirror of the sun stone covered by the ceiling, which is like a sun, providing the basis for photosynthesis of this plant circle. It can be seen that the botanical garden suffered severe damage 40 years ago, but it has not been thoroughly. After nearly half a century of reproduction, nearly 9,000 square meters of soil is flourishing on the soil. Because the underground empire the world has exceeded ordinary city craftsmanship decades drainage system, the vitality of the botanical garden in the corner of the lone general growth alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s all relatively common plants, and it’s not worth the magic powder. Because the species we saw in front of us have more viability, they are preserved. They occupy 95% of the botanical garden today, and the fragile precious varieties. Almost all of the war was extinct as early as the war, otherwise it would be a treasure house." Elizabeth regretted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine is already content, this is just half of his perfect prototype of "Eden". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The draft paper and the sheepskin roll at hand are already used for the second time. Augustine has to return to the ground of the poetry castle again. He has all the information. They were transported from the carriage to an old study on the 4th floor. The location should be the private area of ​​a former person in charge, and he has been opened up as his new study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing in the Poetry Castle On the top platform of the side building, the scorpion boy gave him and Elizabeth the water and brown bread that had just been purchased from a distant town. The little "lily" of the little loli's body witch's heart licked two hard-bread breads, suddenly pointed Shouted: "Augustin, I am fed up with your abuse, I want red wine, venison, goose down big bed, 貂 shawl!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, you can find a big aristocrat in the emperor, telling him that you are from the northernmost big shaman, that is, the lady who is very close to the blacklist, I think he will give you Bolt. The wine of the winery, the tender meat of Zhuxia Liluyuan, the huge goose down bed, the most valuable suede shawl.” Augustine’s dazed little girl reached out. “Before you go, give back your black bread and water. Me, I am a miser who can't squander a few small copper plates."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little girl Over-the-head, licking and biting the rough brown bread, shouted: "Even if I want to go, wait for me to eat you poor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems The lovely Miss Elizabeth forgot, her lady's food intake is not big, it is not easy to eat the young Augustine who has a small treasury. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, wait for the Black Swan Lake Castle to work successfully, I will consider giving you the treatment of aristocratic ladies." Augustine laughed, staring at the serene black swan If the green lake in the lake can really grow csomo, he must make the Black Swan Lake a restricted area. Otherwise, it is easy to reveal the truth about it and the third floor. When you think of it, Augustine will stop talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wasn't a lady of the celebrity. It was just a heresy with a human coat. You don't need to take me seriously." The little girl sneered, sitting on the edge of the wall and shaking her little ankle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without you, how can I get the 'entry ticket' in the fields of arcane, gamma, red and black alchemy?" Augustine softly sigh. There is no shortage of genius in any age of the empire, but not all geniuses can enter the threshold of multiple fields at the same time. Occasionally, some lucky people with both talent and * often cannot have "strong and powerful" teachers like Elizabeth. Her tireless guidance, not the genius of Augustine, is still only a normal person who has more chaos theory than the average person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your subtext should be, without me, you can't go on those roads urgently and unimpededly? You are this abominable guy! The little girl gnashed her teeth and transferred all her anger to the black bread. Soon a piece of bread with a price of 1 and 5 copper plates was solved by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without you, I can't even go to the emperor, let alone go out to the Black Swan Lake Manor." Augustine came to her and sat slowly Next, "A poor worm with no relatives, no friends, even half of allies and trading partners can be found. There is a guy around him who is willing to leave his back. Even if she is mean, she still likes to bite. A good thing that makes people feel uncomfortable to fall to the bottom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you accidentally accompany you to the full paragraph, it may be the darkest distance in your life, I am really Great." The little girl softly looked at the black swan lake like a sapphire in the distance, no longer tangled with the hapless beggar who gave it to others. She took back her eyes and looked at the man still looking into the distance. Raising a sly smile, smiled brilliantly: "Augustin, if I leave like a teacher in your mouth, Artemis, will you miss me this bad woman? I don't want too much, half of her will be fine. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Of. "Augustine whispered, though his entire childhood are disseminated in the tall Luo Tong Rothschild mansion, but he does not like to lie, especially lower a person lies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl stopped talking and drank water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’m leaving now, don’t say hello to me.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
