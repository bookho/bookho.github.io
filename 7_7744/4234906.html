			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat boss is obviously also the head of the "king control" creature, see Augustine picks his private favorite whip, plus 5 bourbon silver coins in hand The smiley face is not only charming but also adds a bit of self-righteous tacit understanding. It is a little adoration for the young man who is wearing a shabby but unique taste. After all, the ordinary lord picks up the little loli, which is a training and a serious customer. Directly toward the "king" direction, the so-called king control, is the opposite side of the Queen's control, Xiao Loli does not have a particularly flexible body and gentle personality, it is difficult to be controlled by the king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the "awe-inspiring" fat man gave Augustine a detailed explanation of the commercial distribution of the crow market. The black market of magical props that Augustine needs is not far from the French orange. The Dunkerton Underground Trade Zone, in addition to the northernmost corner of the crow, has a higher-end Champs Elysees Street, where more than 20 different shops have a history of at least a hundred years, and even The two pieces are said to be as old as the Vatican's Tingan, and the fat man has only heard of one of the signs, the Pope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin did not want Elizabeth to go to the bustling Dunkton Trade Zone, go straight to Witch Street and find the "Pope" prop store at the end of the street. Witch Street is extraordinarily dark and dark compared to the noisy crow market. The narrow stone roads are silent people wearing black robes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imperial sorcerer level is more cumbersome than arcane and gamma, and with less than 10 can not wear the identity badge of the Knight Swordsman Different occupations, each level of the magician approved by the Empire has the power to put a badge on the chest of the magic robe, 1 to 3 is a low-level, wearing a perennial grass magic badge, 4 to 6 belongs to the middle, wearing a purple lily badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 to 9 is a high-grade sword daisy association badge, like Augustine who is qualified as a magician 5 level magician, can wear two petals of purple lily The 10th grade advances into the Great Sorcerer. From 10 to 16, the turmeric flower badge will also increase from the single petal to the 6 petals that the ordinary magician worships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 17th to 20th grades are known as the inviolable magic sage class, and most of the magicians in this rank have entered the Royal Magic Society, or the Imperial Magician Cradle Morgan The college coached, or in the local county magic associations in the high position, a small part scattered in the huge family of the empire, became the aristocratic family magic teacher, they generally get a gold with the imperial prime minister or occasionally issued by the emperor Judith Clover medal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Empire is able to withstand the Titan Empire, the "God of the God of War", which launches a wave of tidal waves almost every five years. It is certainly not the number of sacred knights and holy swordsmen who are only a quarter of the "war mad" Titan. It is the number of magicians and arcanes who are second only to the gorse dynasty. It has been analyzed by the Empire think tank. The cost of cultivating a Titan's first sacred knight is 1 to 6 times that of the imperial magician, so it is sacred. The most words in the mouth of the imperial court magistrate, "It is our spell that dragged the wheel of the Titan chariot and broke the spear of the Titan devil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, some people dismissed it. "Twenty years ago, the Black Rose Knights, which had the most blood in the Empire, blocked the Titan’s crazy attack. It was the most insidious of the Titans in the past 100 years with the price of the Knights. The bloody hawkish generals, along with their fanatical followers, pulled into hell. 20 years later, the Empire Caesar gold coin filled with the Titan aristocratic pocket slowed the pace of the war beast, the great feat of the imperial magician? The proud guys ,go with Look at the southern battlefield. The most corpses on the Titan spear are the ones who are ignorant and weak."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the father of the Duke of Augustine, and later regarded as The No. 2 traitor in the coat of the Empire's elegant poet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin has not participated in large-scale military operations, but it is absolutely certain that there is no commander who is deeply involved in knight warfare and magical deployment, and the movements are often slower than the knights and even the infantry. The magician, once brought close to the enemy, in front of the big army, their dazzling spells are absolutely not imaginary, and then only unilateral slaughter, Titan Knight, the most favorite is to wear badges The magician pierced the gun and then smashed the corpses together and picked them on the sharp sharp gun that was soaked in blood. That was the Cavaliers' biggest and most silent red glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the younger brother of Augustin has no choice to bury himself in magic books since childhood, and he is not intoxicated, even if he has a more beautiful than Miss Elizabeth. The magician teacher who is closer to God, Augustine just chooses to believe in her, not faith in magic. For Augustine, who is more aware of the crisis than the Duke and Prince of Australia, he can control a little skill and sleep well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of oneself is the last and most reliable trump card in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fundamental reason that supports him to reach the high-order realm of the 10th main occupation of the Empire. As for whether there is still a desire to be qualified to witch The careful thoughts of Artemis's body are secrets buried deep in the heart of the empire's public enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the black robe magicians walking on the Champs Elysees Street wear the sword daisy badge. Occasionally, one or two old turmeric badges and great magicians pass by Augustin. The magician occupation may be a possible pick. The road of great honor, but definitely a road of silence and silence, except for the imperial darlings such as Constantine who are talented and lucky to be born in the big family, and Augustine happens to be with the young newcomers in the city of Jubit. The little mustard and the estrangement, when he had hoped to improve the situation, Prince Odis was sent to the statue of St. Urban, and Rotong Childe slipped into the dark abyss, which was quite interested in him. The flower of the city of Augsburg also wisely changed the investment target. After all, Napoleon, the priest of the old priesthood, was the most popular red man in the present. I am afraid that even the emperor of Judit had to take time to look at the young man. A pious young man who is pious and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stood across the street, looking at the "Pope" antique store that was much simpler than expected, and did not rush into it. Apparently, Elizabeth, who prefers the Dunkerton underground market, is impatient: "I know that you don't want to let the many observers hidden in the dark know your details. After all, a guy has two bottles of unidentified Hailuo's hot springs. It's a new thing that can make the crow market boil for a long time, but you are not afraid of a weird and uncommon guy in the Witch Street to recognize the longan Titan Staff in your hand? The trouble will only be bigger! Your shortsighted eyes "Coward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not afraid to deal with big guys like Greenspan, or even go to war. But I have a headache and entanglement with the greedy little nobility of Alpha City. The former won't care if I have two bottles or ten bottles of heroin-level magic liquids. They must be more interested in today's auction of oranges, but the latter will." Augustine did not agree, decided to go into the "Pope", this It is absolutely impossible for the block to appear in the signboard of the Imperial Capital. In the Holy Empire, the Pope is a taboo word on the Titan, because of the serious differences between the major teachings such as "The Pope has no Paradox". One of the two divisions is the Byzantine and the Vatican, and the powerful Byzantine is the father of the whole continent. The Vatican is finally accepted by the Holy Empire as a state religion. The expulsion of the Pope and the Patriarch's teachings is the root cause of the Pope's Office and the Ministry of the Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I want to go to Duncton, the fat man said there are a lot of beautiful magic powder, can be beautiful." Elizabeth wrinkled her face and finally told the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When I have money in my pocket, I am no longer a dangerous person with two bottles of conch hot springs. Of course, Miss Elizabeth will go to Dunkton to feast her eyes. I want a ghost of 40,000 Caesar gold coins in my pocket. I am willing to take out dozens of gold coins to buy some rewards for a lady housekeeper who is doing her best to do housework." Augustine laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth was touched by the rare generosity of Augustine. She had forgotten how long it was for two meals a day. It was a black bread with a half copper plate. When thirsty, I could only drink the water of the Black Swan Lake. I was tired and only had no goose down sheets. The cold wooden bed, occasionally wanting to go to the Augustin cot for a little warmth, will be smashed by him, and the Queen Elizabeth, who feels the fate of her destiny, can only transfer her anger to the little pet whose fate is more tragic than her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The antique shop "Pope" does not have a weird old man who sleeps, or a wrinkled old witch, but a young girl, Professor Shirley, a Even if you kill someone, you will make the man feel innocent and pure angel face, with the most hot white rose, the prostitute is also inferior to the devil figure, especially the weapon on the chest that allows a bard to praise the creator, let Augustine I also spent a long time. If the girl wearing a black and white clean maid costume appeared alone, Augustine would never be sluggish, but she stood alone in this antique shop with a gothic style. Heeled with a feather duster to wipe the glass cabinet, hit the high place, and also gently jumped, and then the shaking of the natural is her chest heavy two beautiful, see Miss Elizabeth can not wait to immediately take out the whip to beat her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beautiful lady, may I ask, is the ‘hot spring’ acquired here?” Augustine asked with a smile, looking at the antique shop without warning. There aren't many collections, but each piece is a luxury that has the power of 10 or more magic to fully control. Not far from Augustine is a row of "song" level black crystal magic wand, amazingly those magic The rod is made of "deep autumn" black crystal that is not scarce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of magical exercise, the magic craftsmen who can create the props that differ by more than two levels are already geniuses, belonging to the innocent level of "deep autumn" Ranked 5th in the mineral rating, and "Song" is second only to the sacred, epic, and sighing level 9, then the master who created these magic wands is undoubtedly a genius in the genius, such a magic wand The value and price must be 8 times or even higher with the sigh level material to create the sigh level equipment. The amazing Augustine line of sight has not returned to the "maid", except for the magic wand, robes and a lot of "winter birds". The grade of magical powder and liquid from the minerals of the minerals, Augustine finally found a law that made him laugh and laugh, but it was extremely shocking. The antique store’s props in the public eye can be among the luxury, but certainly not more than the witch street. The collection store is more expensive and rare, but it is definitely the only big-name antique shop that can lift the price to an exaggerated level. Augustine believes that the "Pope" is truly collected. Things will be very valuable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear sir, we only buy hot springs above the '砝 bud' level. If it is a conch that can reach 95 or more, we will definitely give you a satisfactory price." Pure maid turned and smiled, innocent Like a little girl who is not deeply involved, it is hard to imagine that the "Pope" will be assured that this role will take care of the store. It seems that she is a simple vase that has been abducted into bed by a few handsome aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You identify it." Augustine pulled out a beautiful crystal bottle with a half-human pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perfect Conch! This is the second time I have seen such a pure hot spring, 99:99, ah, you really plan Want to sell this bottle of little guys? It's not the usual Conch-type hot springs. If I remember correctly, I haven't seen such a lovely hot spring in the Imperial market for many years. I advise you to take it to Morgantown. Believe me, esteemed gentleman, the imperial magic cradle will have a lot of big magician of level 10 or above willing to buy it at a high price! Even someone will lend to the damn bloodsucker banker, but also have it!" The shape curve is infinitely attractive However, the girl dressed in coolness exclaimed, and her face should never appear on the face of a businessman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't I willing to buy it here?" Augustine groaned, and there was an unspeakable emotion in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that he initially despised these little guys who carved the ancient coat of arms of the centaur. Also, the always elegant Duchess always gave him the most distressed The best thing for the son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest pleasure of having three ancient surnames is to listen to Augustine’s "sweet flowers" with a tender and crisp voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the sky in Augsburg is always very sunny, and the sun in Rotongschild is always very harmonious, a wise and kind mother, Tell her children about the story of the dragon and the princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My child, killing the dragon to save the princess, that is what the warriors do. You will be a carefree aristocrat, waiting for you to grow Big, my mother will find you the most attractive girl in the empire, okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the mediocre Luotong Childe’s heirs will also He stupidly smeared his saliva and nodded hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin’s eyes are not easy to detect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course I am willing, but the price is definitely not comparable to the Morgan auction. This is 100,000 Caesar gold coins, 100 Imperial Caesars, and you should check it carefully." The girl handed August 100 empire Caesars worth a thousand Caesar coins. The huge wealth of 100,000 Caesar gold coins was handed over to Augustine in a handy manner. She quickly took the crystal bottle and seemed to be afraid of the customers in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, I take it back." Augustine suddenly shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Do you think the price I gave is not fair enough?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope "The sale has never been counter-offered. This time, the girl seems to be unable to break this ancient stereotype. I sincerely said: "I will add 20,000 Caesar gold coins, sir, this is my greatest sincerity, in the crow set. City and Champs Elysées, it is impossible to have a higher price than this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin still shakes his head gently, and a stack can quickly get rid of him The Caesar vouchers, which are aristocratic and eligible to enter the legal orange auction, are returned to the girl, refilling the crystal bottle, and turning out of the "Pope" in the shock, anger and incomprehension of the girl. The girl stood in the same place. She didn't think that the middle-level magician wearing a regular robes wanted to rely on a bottle of conch hot springs to go to the far-flung Morgan Plain. She could see that he refused the deal. The wealth of desire, a young magician who is not hot and greedy, does not have that ambition and speculative hobby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful girl with a beautiful figure, Professor Shirley, made a snap, and a delicate and beautiful long-tailed black-skinned bird passed through the window and stopped on her arm. She tore off a piece of white paper, wrote a paragraph, and stuffed it into the mouth of the black canary. This is a mechanical bird that represents the high level of the Vatican's Tingan Ministry of Science and Technology. It is a perfect blend of magic and alchemy. The wisdom is crystallized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl voice suddenly turned from a lightness to a mature charm in conversation with Augustine, saying to herself: "Little Alice of the Greenspan family, look Come to me to find a good private magic teacher for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin walked out of the pope and sighed, apologetic: "Elizabeth, I can only owe you a few more Ten Caesar gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Lori Guanjia, who lost a lot of wealth, was surprisingly innocent, and the lady gently took Augustine’s hand and smiled: "Poor egg Augustin, after you return to Black Swan Lake, can you sing "Lullaby" to me before going to bed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
