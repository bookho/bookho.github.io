			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Augustine borrowed more than a dozen boxes from the Earl of Old Clough to enter the Alpha City Legal Orange auction, he once cut a meat carriage to him and caused it to still The sly ghost, the lord of Marseille, who has a natural sense of smelling gold coins, opened a box in person, and his eyes immediately broke out of the sacred line of the ultra-super-line. He struggled to bend down and picked up a golden Caesar coin, like a caressing lover. Satin-like silky tenderness and body, this world, with only this Caesar gold coin and bourbon silver coin, for the mistress and the slave girl, no matter how delicate and beautiful, the Earl of Marseille is only good at whip candles and ropes. He once had a famous saying that was widely praised by bankers: Caesar gold coins are good lovers because she can give you countless children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin pointed to the box, loaded with 900,000 gold coins, and the remaining 300,000 was laid on the ground by Elizabeth, smiling: "The Earl of Marseille These are yours."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the secret room, the obese and bloated Earl of Marseille got up and got up, even if it was out of court, he had to look at it. The new master of the dark world of Maso County, but the corner of the eye is still greedily staring at the golden yellow, eager and cautious: "The ruling lord, the distant and mysterious eastern country, the peacock dynasty has a saying that there is no fame, then Nothing. I want to know what you need me to do for you to get these cute and charming little guys."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin has direct contact with the bottom line of Alpha City," I know that you have a less formal relationship with some southern slave owners and ordnance traders, so the law orange can be so hot, don't worry, Count, I am not talking about the rigid teachings with 900,000 Caesar gold coins. On the contrary, I am willing to breathe Out of this money, as well as the right to asylum of a member of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Church, in exchange for a part of the business of the law orange, in the future, the law orange and the entire Alpha city will receive corresponding redemption and purification, such as the Earl of Marseille has been a headache family roots now In Alpha, but in the imperial capital, the court priest Guolan, who often smashes your reputation, I can invite the old priest’s misguided magician son to go to the poem.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; often boast that when a city owner is too wasteful, the Earl of Marseille, who should go to the emperor as the Minister of Trade, turned his eyes and seemed to be thinking about the trade-offs, but Augustine knew that he was rejecting, just brewing the wording, not wanting to annoy a just hit Win a new giant in the sacred battle of the sacred battle. An old priest who is highly respected but has no actual right to speak does not pose a threat to the fat man Marseille. It only damages some of the dispensable reputation. He wants him to surrender a part of the legal business share of Orange Rich, which is better than killing his illegitimate child. Uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Augustine is not in a hurry. In the Odea Monastery, the copying of the ancient scriptures has to test the patient perseverance more than there are too many things in the world. He just lost the wife of Fiona who came to Alpha to solve the business of the Champs Elysees Street. One look, the latter handed a list to the Alpha City Lord in due course. The Earl had never looked at the Queen of the Marshall Sharon No. 2, who had been chatting at the banquet several times, and showed an admirable determination. Taken on the list, which lists a string of dark species that means profiteering on any auction site, a militant Tauren chief, a huge gray blood mammoth, a rare fallen elf, a handsome longevity, and the Earl of Marseille There is no doubt that he has heard about the terrorist war in Black Swan Lake. This is the real reason why he does not dare to face up to Mrs. Fiona. Augustine, who gave the first sincerity, smiled and said: "In addition to the box of the dozens of Jupiter City's Count Claf to the poetry castle, plus the list of things, and the asylum I mentioned, in the end, I only I will receive a profit of one-fifth of the orange of the law. If I lose money, I will withdraw from the legal orange when the loss of 900,000 Caesar coins is over. But I believe that the operation of the Earl of Marseille will not give me a chance to lose money." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Marseille is a little sluggish, is there such a generous and friendly businessman? He quickly calculated it in his head. At present, the annual profit of French orange is as high as 2.1 million, but the cost of all aspects is half, and the net profit is about one million Caesar coins. One-fifth is 200,000. Not small, but the participation of a young consul, the vaginal lord of the Marceau County, the loss of some of the big aristocrats and some of the big bishop's pockets that make people feel distressed, can you save some? No matter how it is calculated, this sale is earned, and the Earl of Marseille feels comfortable. Don't look at the countless Marseilles, but in fact, a small town owner in a county province is always at a disadvantage when negotiating with the proud and arrogant Southern slave owners or military speculators. Every time they pay a few young prostitutes in Tameilang. Sufficient sincerity, spending money and consuming God, the awful thing is that the other party is not necessarily sympathetic. The former governor is too different. This is the elegant aristocrat, the real big man, the face of Marseille is full of bright smiles, a fat The flesh is excited and trembling. The precious list is carefully folded and placed in the pocket. I promised: "I will do my utmost to earn the maximum profit for the governor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin Nodded, seemed to think of something, smiled and said: "Correct a small mistake, these are the gold coins of the Earl of Marseille, but the old Clough gave me the gift of this private priest, not the poetry song, not the order." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Marseille immediately understood and nodded and said: "Understand. Sincerely praise your sincere friendship with Count Clough." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine walked out of the Chamber of Secrets and intentionally and unintentionally said: "I should have a long and happy friendship with Count Marseille. I hope that if possible, ten years later, Count Marseille can sit in the position of Trade Minister. At that time, not only me. , Laclav, the Pompeii family, and many friends of the emperor, will also congratulate you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Marseille did not dare to look at the legendary glance At a glance, you can earn a thousand prominent positions in Caesar gold coins. But when you hear such words, you are quite comfortable. You personally bend over and send the consul to the ruler orange. Hesitated, and asked young but new allies to stay for a while. He ran back to the lower floor of the auction site, took out a bunch of keys from behind a mural, opened a dark room in a secret room, and gritted his teeth and pulled out a silver box that painted the "king of angels" and the sacred pattern of Gabriel. Silver, The powerful metal in the Gabrielian sequence, announcing the sacredness of God's favor, contains a masterpiece from the hand of Emperor von Charlemagne. The Earl of Marseille has today's wealth, not just It relies on the aristocratic title given to him by his father and the speculative acts of frequent imperial law. He knows the balance between pay and return more than anyone else, so it is easy for the fat man to teach in the Imperial Trade Organization. Augustine took a small but heavy box and felt the familiar abyss. He finally revealed his sincere smile for the first time. He calmly said: "The count of the beloved count, you and I have taken the right first step, Luo Tongchai Germany will not let any one who disapproves the goodwill of the sable flower."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the carriage of the Witch Street, in addition to the Augustine, which details the silver box pattern, And Mrs. Fiona, who has a face to worship, and a new species nicknamed "The Viscount", the Lich King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver of this carriage is the blonde nephew Ares. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the prince-level servant hidden in the dark from the tombstone, Dimit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving the monopoly of Witch Street, Augustine is about to travel to Jupiter, the hub of the empire. There, the second teacher, Little Clough, was to be baptized. In addition to this only warmth, the rest, probably with a mixture of ridiculous belly and unscrupulous eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Champs Street is the magic trade place at the highest end of Alpha City. Store owners and antique shop owners have good connections and *, but their restraint and arrogance They were defeated by the empire's popular lover, Caesar Gold. Augustine was not easy. He paid all the money he had searched from Lancôme Castle, and even sold some art, but it was a total of seven figures. Gold coins. Spending money like water, Augustine burst into a bitter smile, but fortunately this disappointing sorrow was immediately cleaned up after the opening of the silver box by the Earl of Marseille. It was a veritable quality dark gold, the body was the same as Augustine’s original The abyss species belonging to the same vein, after being summoned to fall into this plane, unfortunately collapsed into a doll of ten centimeters in length, but the Earl of Hanmasai does not understand that the dark gold is not a dead thing, but also needs constant feeding, resulting in This dark gold scorpion shrank so badly that Augustine got off the bus and went to Mrs. Quentin's pope antique shop, where there was a high-end bait for the needs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine walked along the Champs-Elysées with Mrs. Fiona from the future, because two-thirds of the shops on the street were closed and closed, the business was deserted, and many of the old magic wearing the butterfly or the badge of the butterfly was lost. Division, Alpha City, the bloody Lolita slave market, there is a black market of crows intertwined with many dark moves, there is an immoral legal orange auction, but Witch Street is the only clean area, the magic of Maso County Members of the guild, even if they don't buy goods, are willing to walk and browse the quaint and quiet architectural scenery along the road. Witch Street is surrounded by a small artificial river. There is no noisy tavern on the riverside. Only private bookstores, churches and magic guilds that barely maintain balance are kept. A few banned books that existed in the bookstore more or less are largely tolerant, not to mention that many of them are customers of such books. They don’t buy, just sit in the bookstore and sneak a few pages and drink. A cup of green tea from the peacock dynasty, or chewing on a tobacco that has just been popular in the mainland. Passes by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Fiona with a proud figure whispered: "The order grows up, you are the smartest businessman I have ever seen. I say this will offend." Are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, who is carrying a brand new dark gold plaque and followed a white robe sorcerer, laughs: "This is a good compliment, Especially from the savvy Fiona mouth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Fiona’s mouth twitched, her eyes were bright, and she did not hide her joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is ready to hand over the Witch Street to the murder of the Count of Heber, and he talked about some professional things, "first pull the enemy's expectations on the negotiating table. The bottom line. Then gradually rise, the expectations of the two are roughly the same, so the sale becomes a very simple skill. Fiona, the special occasion of operating the Champs-Elysées is more important than the profit, you have to pay attention to one Vocabulary, repeated game, this is the key to win the trust of customers. Visitors to Witch Street, whether it is a magician or a second-hand seller of gold rush, no one is a fool, you need to sacrifice some profits to establish a long-term stable trading relationship. Don't feel bad, a few boxes of gold coins, for me, that doesn't matter, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Fiona smiled: "Because the order is only first Those gold coins are deposited in your pocket, so sooner or later you are, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine is a bit surprised, this woman is really a natural businessman, appreciates : "Fiona, you are very Ming, this is why I chose to let you master most of the Champs, not Mrs. Quentin, who is full of classical aristocratic thinking, so I will give you the right to manage, and trust."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
