			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poetry underground castle is a maze of artistic and strategic values ​​in the eyes of Augustine, a fun castle that can bring him security and surprises. For the escort team of the shofar, the poem is nothing more than a strangely stronghold. After the initial excitement, the knights swordsmen who could not move around on the first floor of the poetry brother began to get bored, although the high-purity fluorite belt Come to the light, but the underground is the underground, empty room, familiar with the 20 faces that can no longer be familiar, the only seven or eight women left in the horns do not know where to be taken by the young and strange governor, in the training room After consuming the last bit of energy and patience, a burly swordsman first broke out with strong dissatisfaction. He stood in the center of the martial arts hall and kept groaning. Some knights and swordsmen also echoed, and his eyes were hot, as if he had overthrown the ruling. There will be countless cheeses, wines, and plump women in the rule of the official. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are few singular characters in the magician, most of them sit quietly in the room to study the magic books they carry with them, and occasionally they are not recognized by the Imperial Magic Association. Black magic handwriting, the magicians who enter the sacrament are mostly quasi-heretics who want to seek special shelter. If they want to be sent to the ruling by the old-fashioned magic association, they will only take the initiative to sell their lives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We go out and turn around." The headed Swordsman laughed and laughed. I am afraid that only half of his weak consuls appeared in front of him. He will be directly cut into bolognese by the unusually large and heavy O'Brien sword in his hand. He is the only member of the escort member who has won the Oak Leaf Medal and has lost the other big swordsmen and grand knights. In the absence of the situation, Benson naturally has a high prestige. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Banson, calm down." An elderly knight stopped the road and stopped at the door trying to convince the grumpy Benson not to get into trouble. "We don't have The challenge is a sufficient reason for the governor’s established agreement, which will have unpredictable consequences.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The timid knight, don’t use your etiquette to measure The weight of a great swordsman in the hands of a great swordsman." Benson sullenly laughed and raised his hand in the middle of the empire's official swordsman, the popular O'Brien sword, placed on the shoulders of the old knight, pressed hard to the next, the hair was white The old knight's knees bent a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old knight chose to give way at the last minute before the outbreak of Benson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great knight of the scorpion took back the giant sword and spit on the ground, cursing: "The shrine's knight's rule."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old knight's body trembled, but in the end he still did not make a radical move, even the rebuttal on the mouth did not, some young knights who did not intend to follow Benson's violation of the agreement also looked disdainful out of the training martial arts, deliberately bypassing the body stiffness The old knight, it seems that the original mouth-watering Edward Dark Blue medal on his chest is no longer dazzling. The old knight looks at the martial arts hall with only the few conservatives, and sighs gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A magician with a tender face on his face went to the old man and cares: "Old Eugene, is it okay?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old knight shook his head and said: "This is nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man gently touched the chest The Edwardian family awarded the medals to the Knights, and the medals were somewhat old-fashioned by the years. The Dark Blue Medal is only a low-level medal of the Edwardian family. It is not a series of honorary medals from the Imperial official to prove the level, but the British Willard Terrier Edward. It's not easy. This hunting bear, known for its brave martial arts, ranks fourth in the empire's many family rankings. It is an honor in its own right, so Edward High-order 更 prefers to wear a family medal instead of an imperial medal. The old-school knight who abides by the rules seems to have gained great courage at once, squeezing a smile and slap the youngest magician in the team. "Hall, go, tell me about your latest magical array research. It is called gold." What is the pendulum?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the second dark gold pendulum compound magic array! Old Eugene, this is the most inspiring in the 100 magical arrays. One of the sacred magic arrays." The young magician protested. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, what is the dark gold? I don’t know this old man, but gold is a good thing, the only thing in the world that is more attractive than a lady." The old knight also showed a certain sense of humor in front of the young people. He looked at the baby face youth who is now a 5th-level magician. His eyes are full of the kindness of his elders. This little Hall can survive and walk to this mysterious atmosphere. The poetry brother, Eugene could not help but be grateful to the Lord of omniscience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magician who pays more attention to the theory than the practice has turned his eyes and patiently explained: "Old Eugene, even a pound of gold can not buy one. The dark gold that belongs to the 'God Metal' sequence, it is not a magical element that can be measured by money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old knight does not agree, for him, except for the knight The guidelines and the favor of elegant ladies, what dark gold pendulum magical array of God metal, are all headaches, just want to take a break and talk to young people, the old Eugene closed his mouth, accompanied by Xiaohuo Going to the corner room, although he is not interested in magic, he likes to watch the little Hall's eyebrows dancing when he talks about magic theory, which is full of the vitality that these old men don't have. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy who followed Benson’s walk out of the martial arts hall to “walk” has seventeen or eight, talking about the hearsay’s secrets of the imperial aristocratic bed. Or, the body of several female assistants in the horns, but the last topic is concentrated in the shofar position. Professor Shirley, who is second only to the researcher of the Yi, is talking about her towering double peaks, slender waist and small rounds. The rich buttocks, only at this time, most of the Rough Knights of the Swordsman can play a superb artistic atmosphere, Banson is undoubtedly the most talkative one, because he arrived before the Black Swan Lake and cooked - Female Sister, the man who spoke the most, he is willing to share this pleasure at the top of the team. "What is her ass feeling, do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Banson deliberately raised a hand, compared to a round curve, a bunch of people behind him swallowed a saliva, wide-eyed, as if Benson was holding a mature-female sister's ass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s the same as her milk---" Banson laughed loudly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of male creatures were irritated with red eyes, half of them squatting and looking at Benson. They originally thought that this guy was just more than Professor Shirley. Speaking a few words, at most, pinching her hand, I did not expect to progress to such an amazing degree, so the animals could not help but expand the association, and the mature-female professor walked and shook all the people's eyes. The ass was touched, and the twin peaks that trembled and trembled and the man’s eyes were also stunned. Then what should be done next, will you not do it? At the crucial moment when almost everyone was thinking, Benson intentionally or unintentionally slowed down the corner at a corner and was taken from the lead position to the third place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one noticed the red enamel sign on the corner wall, except that it appeared to be only violent and full of erotic thoughts in addition to outstanding military values. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two knights then found the scorpion boy standing not far from them, the one who grew a face that was more beautiful than the female in the eyes of some fraternal nobles. Dumb, he stood opposite the two 6-level knights, no anger, no surprise, like a skeleton that was drawn to the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson’s right foot suddenly stopped and hung in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Benson, several of the accomplices turned around and slammed into Benson’s huge body, only to find that things were a bit abnormal, and the line of sight passed through Benson’s body. A face that is not far away, pale and thin, sluggish and stiff, everyone moves down the line of sight, the heart jumps in the same breath, and finally understands why Banson will stop and step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two hands of the scorpion were inserted in the heart of the two "pioneers", and then pinched, resulting in a very dull but extremely harsh blasting sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two hearts were pinched by him! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extracting hands, two strong bodies that did not completely disappear their life, leaning forward, holding the neck by the scorpion before the ground, the five fingers contracted, completely broken, they twisted Breaking a reed is generally an understatement, and then licking their twisted neck, the scorpion is sure that no one will step into the restricted area drawn by the owner, then turn around and gently drag the body to the end of the aisle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, the sheep's horn downstairs is just a little more fresh experimental material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a generous ruler adult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson’s eyeballs almost came out, waiting for the devil’s back to disappear from the opposite corner, and he was finally able to take back the right foot that had been hanging in the air for a long time. The head did not return to the ground and returned, simply ignoring the group of comrades who were abducted by him. The devil is definitely the monster in the hidden organization of the ministry! Benson can fight against the enemies who eat the "shofar" without fear of death, but will never be willing to rub with the "self" of the Ministry of the Ministry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who can not feel the taste of a warrior or a mage, Banson never provokes a second time, which is also stronger than him. The reason why the Cavaliers swordsmen died but he was able to reach the finish line. Just as Benson was secretly lucky, he found that the guy in the hall of the theater was the last thing he wanted to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing cosmo young leader, Augustine, standing next to him is a child who looks even more surprised than a blonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that Professor Shirley feels good, this respectable oak swordsman, I guess the professor also wants to try your hand." Augustine smiles Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson’s last few minutes was full of madness and smug rough face all of a sudden converted to flattery, fast, amazing, he did After the knight's ceremony, he seemed to realize that the big man standing in front of him was more like a priest, and he had a sacred triangle gesture in Vatican, and he respectfully bowed his head: "The ruling adult, I dare not go beyond the limit to the maximum extent. Watching the lower corridor, the poetry brother is an indestructible fortress. Only a great leader like you can build such a magnificent castle. I am willing to fight for you. It is the greatest honor of any oak swordsman!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the guy entered the "Ewe", he was a 100-year-old aristocrat who struggled to enter the upper class. Even Augustine admired his change. He smiled and said: "Do you really feel the experience of Professor Shirley? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson, who didn’t return to his heart, immediately replied with a serious look: “Reporting the Archon’s adult, it’s just that I’m irresponsible, how dare I dare It is impossible to offend a knowledgeable professor!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine showed a very satisfied smile and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banson secretly wiped his sweat on his forehead and was grateful for his urgency. He would only thank him at that moment for inheriting only a broken jazz title and a body. The broken aristocratic father of the huge debt, after all, the old drunkard still gave himself a stupid head and a slippery mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the squadrons behind Banson who were abducted and ruthlessly abandoned, they were sluggish and open-minded, and they were stunned and hypocritical. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Banson and others fell from the paradise to the edge of hell, the old knight Eugene was yawning and listening to Little Hall about the second dark golden pendulum magic array. The quintessence, when the young theorist talks about the rise, he will use a quill to sketch the magical array on the wall. Obviously, this young man who will be rejected by the orthodox magic association because of the inconsistency of the idea is not because The only audience lacked interest and dispelled enthusiasm. He continued to draw the most magical part on the wall, adding a series of difficult element conversion formulas. Finally, his thoughts were all stuck in a lone string that suddenly jumped out of his mind. On the argument, holding a quill pen against the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Eugene changed his sitting position, slept comfortably, and had long been used to the "sleepwalking" of Little Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An uninvited guest suddenly appeared next to the young magician, took his quill, circled a large number of formulas, and chuckled: "This is wrong. The magic world, any inconspicuous deviation can bring the efforts of a magician to the original point of his life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the man used the wall The beautiful fonts write a series of characters that are far darker and deeper than the little Hall, and a lot of unknown mysterious material conversion formulas. If you say that there are many famous "theoretical masters" in the "Ewe" magician It is a lizard squatting on the magic threshold. Then, the person who stopped listening to him because he heard him mutter, in the eyes of the proud little Hall, is a top creature that exceeds countless numbers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
