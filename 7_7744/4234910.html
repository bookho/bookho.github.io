Seeking collections and black tickets~~~)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heterodox Cartes In the wonderful battle with the three main professional field players, he fully demonstrated the tenacity of a big knight. The audience other than the magician did not understand the meaning of the young black robes and summoned the red and black high-density spheres. They only saw The big knight who did not fall behind after the turn of the offensive seemed to be "purified" by the purple lily magician in an instant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the black radiance from Augustine is so dazzling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the layman, this is the most thrilling picture, a dark arbiter from the Ministry of the Holy Sepulchre, who easily solves a Saxon forest heresy, this At the very least, he would have at least 7 levels of tulip magician smashing magic to "swallow" unless he came from the Royal Torch Academy's mysterious institution "Torch". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise it may only be a sacramental mages who is deeper than the heresy in the taboo area, so no one doubts the judge’s identity as a high-order The members of the Inquisition have different levels of "purification" privileges, trial and conviction of heresy according to the principle of proximity, the principle of high-level coverage, and the ultimate leader over the three principles of imperial law. Of course, everyone in the law has no chance. After the implementation of the two principles, especially the third rule, I am afraid that many of the Holy Red Archbishops who are not well-recognized by the Holy See have not been able to witness it. It requires the personal judgment of the 3 giants of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Interior, and the Imperial Aristocrats can only At the major ceremony of the Royal Academy of Magic, every five or six years, I saw the only one of the three giants who retained the title of nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, now the Imperial Holy See has the authority to use the leader of the Ministry of Justice above the legal principles, and a young priest, the descendants of the traitor, "Order" Archon Augustin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carver teacher, what is the unrivaled high-level magic skill? Like you gave me the "magic sacred system" level 52 [Jun Wang En Pet], can you take the other party’s nuclear water as your own energy? But it seems to be different from the system, but can you explain it to me?” The third floor noble room is specially set for the Greenspan family. On, a young woman with a holy face raised her doubts, besides the yellow sunflower medal winner Ellen, and Greenspan’s "wild boar" Bud, who was the eagle of the empire in the last two years. One of the representative figures of the military is opposite to the hawkish generals with the Pompeii family as the core. If it were not for the two hawks, the emperor’s chamber of the city of Judit had no foundation for the moderates and the Conservatives. The first impression is that a pious woman can sit next to the "wild boar" Bard and the rookie noble Ellen, proving that she is not an ordinary member of Greenspan, because not every student in Maso County can scream magic. Sage Carver is a teacher<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Alice, on the unskilled 'grabbing' this magical branch, [Jun Wang Grace] is the conversion of the other element into its own nuclear, the conversion rate is not high, and it is too time consuming on the battlefield, so it has always been Without the popular support, the excellent magician at the bottom is directly transforming the individual magic elements of others into their own fusion magic elements, which skips the extra part of the body and saves a lot of conversion rate and time. Children, when you grow up, you understand that in the harsh Royal Magic Association assessment, perhaps the deviation of a mantra can determine whether you are picking the gold clover medal or continue to wear the original tulip badge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man wears a gold clover medal that is enough to win the respect of all the magicians of the empire, thin body, wrinkled vicissitude face, plain black magic robe, white hair white robe white Crystal Staff is a different kind of luxury Greenspan private magician Yalman. He looks at the magic beginner Miss Alice kindly and patiently explains: "The young man It's just the simplest magic ball, using the most common 'affinitive' magic to collect some elements from around the body, condense, and form a sphere that is conducive to energy storage according to the body type theory in the magic law. The difference is that he can simultaneously Summon two elements, and arrange them according to some unknown rules, and finally create a very interesting little magic, can 'eat something', can resist the dark gold elements of sin. Little Alice, this is why the teacher Already the magic sages have to work and learn tirelessly, because magic can always throw one after another temptation, haha, in the eyes of the magician, magic can be more tempting than women. Among the many private tutors of the empire, ceremonial officials Pianists, romantic poets, but more than the magician, the nobles are afraid, for fear of bringing their little princess to the bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Carver The last sentence is exceptionally soft. He is a stereotyped magician, but a funny and harmonious old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Carver teacher, is he really from the Holy See?" It was the woman who was looked at by Augustine outside Alpha City, covering her mouth and laughing. There is an angel face with the "maid" in the "Pope" of Witch Street, but the angel face of the woman who passed by the top heroine hot spring is more innocent and simple "mask", and Alice - Greenspan is like a nun who is from the inside out, but the only pity is that Miss Alice does not have the hot body that Augustine expected, and the chest is as thin as her waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not sure if it is a sacrament, but I am sure he is not from the 'torch'." Old Carver smiled because he is the Royal Academy of Magic. There are not many students in the "Torch" organization. The number of students from 5 to 30 years old is actually more than 90. In the torch, the proportion of the orthodox academic sages in the caravan. Only 30%, the remaining 65% are big geniuses and old madmen who are no different from the sacrament of the sacrament, the last 5% is the most glorious, the teacher who is older or even younger than the students, with the big priest Napoleon and "black purple "The flower is a typical example. The former is always the official orthodox symbol. The manners, words and deeds, and spirits make the most demanding court ceremonies impeccable. The latter is the other extreme. She is always betraying the orthodox magic. St. Donald, the current leader of the Torch, who was the former dean of Morgan College, once said that the greatest pleasure of this child is to dig the wall of the magical hall. She is either a great magician who stepped into the honor of the Mayan temple, or The witch who simply ruined our spiritual pillar, I believe that at that time, the child will laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in addition to the aristocratic hall holding the arrogant big man, almost everyone on the second and third floor of the legal orange customers are on the railing, staring at the ruling of the sacrament of the big knight Descartes, the biggest feeling is this The guy is really young. Some of the bold ladies who are tired of the bard or the handsome pianist look at Augustine with a hot and awe-inspiring look at his fighting power in some way. Among them, the sorrowful widow of the dead nobleman can’t wait to tear open his clothes. The heavy double peaks shouted in the heart: "The adults of the Ministry of the Holy Trinity, use your flesh to teach the devil in my heart!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin instead of Descartes Standing in the encirclement of the magician Arman, the golden lion and the Solomon knives assassin, in addition to the mistakes of Augustine's magical skills, the latter two are more taboo Augustine's role in the sacrament, otherwise in common sense, A short distance confrontation with a top-notch bounty hunter and a swordsman who pulls out two flower knives, unless it is a magician who is skilled in magical mastery to the transcendental realm, or else they are only killed by them. Share. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stroked the Titan longan with the top of the staff and the black crystal. The longan flashed a faint glow and was almost nailed by 21 red and black high-density spheres. The poor heresy who died on the column suddenly vacated, and everyone suddenly looked up. The big knight slammed into the top of the hall and the amethyst chandelier from the gorse workshop was set in a huge chandelier, just like another On a spiritual map, the heresy of the cross was tied to the Olympian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only at this moment, Hera Bolsefele, who has been firmly standing at the center of the column, can see the face of Descartes, although she disapproves of it very much. The reckless behavior of a fanatic follower, but she understands the knight's obsession with walking on the path of faith. For this, she only regrets, looking up at the Saxon comrades who continue to drip down the body blood, the proud and powerful daughter of Zeus. The eyes are extremely dim, and perhaps until now, she has admitted that her honor and glory have been completely lost at the moment when she was smashed down by a fat knight who likes to bite the sable badge on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Marseille, who had felt the bad situation, stood by the railing and gestured to the person in charge of the auction on the first floor, indicating that he would ban Hera-Bau The fall of the column of Selfler, the intuition tells him that the young arbitrator downstairs is ultimately the "female of Zeus", not limited to the head of a heretical knight, but for the Earl of Marseille, both losses are beyond His range of tolerance is all golden Caesar gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The column slowly descended, and finally Hera stood in front of Augustine, and sure enough, she barefooted with Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine bent over to pick up the dark gold dagger that was left by Descartes and threw it to Elizabeth, who was sitting in the front seat and drinking red wine, because the main wealthy merchants in the Maso County who were afraid of being injured by the fight were evacuated to the back position. Elizabeth was very rude to open a bottle of the best vintage Angel wine white wine, which tasted good. When the dark gold dagger automatically took it as a private wealth, Elizabeth felt that the wine was actually better than the water of the Black Swan Lake. It’s too much, just like all her taste buds are jumping a little on the Agate River. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ‘Lusi knives’ is my collection.” A burly man with dazzling golden hair smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine did not turn around and still confronted Andre’s daughter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that our 'Helen's Kitty' is going to be angry." I was going to buy Hera Bolseve with a price of 1.5 million Caesars. Le's aristocratic master laughed, the golden lion is generally a sly and horrible bounty hunter Gordon is a key trump card cultivated by Helen in the past five years. At the age of 35, a warrior's fleshy peak period, "kitten" has already The title of "Hunter" who is only two steps away from the apex, the Helen family has no reason not to trust a monster who can easily kill three 9-level knights in the arena. Especially when the kitten shows a smile, he is ready to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Hera, a distinguished double-professional master, do you know the freckles fat man in Messiah?" Augustine asked with a smile, remembering that he liked childhood. The little fat man Rhein Hatha, who played the game with him, has been accumulating practical experience in Saxon Forest. I heard that a few years ago, he had won the Iron Oak Medal, one of the three medals of the Imperial Soldiers. According to the imperial military history, he was able to The soldiers who won the Iron Oak Medal before the age of half became generals, and half died on the battlefield before the age of 30, because they were all war mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder the sinister empire is the greatest tradition of the Luo Tong Chaid family. On the battlefield, it is also ugly and mean, treason, it is really Luo Tongchaide. It’s best to go home.” Hera Bolsefele sneered, she couldn’t give up on a dead fat man who changed her life’s trajectory, the sturdy fat man who used to wear the sables of the sables, and the imperial politicians felt disgraceful. Destroyed the savior’s hard work and made a counterattack, so that the savior whose original strength almost caught up with the “Poseidon horn” returned to the bleak state 10 years ago. I don’t know why Hera had an involuntary aversion to the young people in front of her. And hatred, because he has a temperament similar to the fat knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the breath of hypocrisy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She may not have imagined that the little fat knight who was very "perverted" in the eyes of the imperial military strategist once liked to be close to the front of the young man’s buttocks. Worship, the old-fashioned aristocratic style of the freckled fat man boasted, and all learned from Master Augustine. Most of the young knights involved in the jihad know that their superiors have an inexplicable mantra "I am a smart pig", and they certainly don't know that the pig's habit of licking his ass from time to time is only because he was stunned by a certain age. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the guy standing a few meters away from Miss Hera, even Hera Bolsefele wants to kill at the expense of body and soul. The successor of Rotong Childe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goddess of fate always likes to make a little naughty after a tragedy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t know why Augustine seems to deliberately cover up his Oggs song accent, and Elizabeth is a bit vague in listening to it. The Queen sipped the fine wine and said to himself: "It’s a cautious consul. You are blessed by the followers of Master Augustine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Thanks to Miss Hera for her sincere compliment to Rothschild." Augustine smiled and smiled, still a vague accent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you a person at the Inquisition?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hella’s mouth evokes a cold Taunting the arc, "You can seize the opportunity to subdue a big knight whose state is hit by the bottom of the valley, but you dare to 'judge' a luxury of 1.5 million Caesar coins from the hands of the great aristocrats!! If the answer is yes, I admire your courage, and ignorance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that Rheinhatten, apart from rudeness and blackmail, did not show you a qualified Rotunchild Heir's 'ignorance'." Augustine smiled happily, seeing the pity of this woman's eyes, half of the contempt for his political literacy, and half of the pity of ignoring the golden lion behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the end of a magician's close-up to a "hunter"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cognition of Miss Greenspan Alice who has recognized this young man, it is nothing more than a painful death and a little death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon, who was trained by the sissy Helen, was sprinting and intended to punch the chest of this arrogant magician. As for how to explain to the Inquisition, that is, the Helen family's gold coins have the final say, he is not worried at all, because the Helen family's ancestral training said nakedly, "There is no soul that cannot be redeemed with gold coins."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she sighed at Hera Bolsefele, she did not see the young enemies holding the eccentric magic wands being smashed by the mighty golden lions, the staff Hanging between her and Gordon, but he himself is mysterious and disappearing. The two most basic latitudes of space and time have always been the sacred privilege of level 80 + magic, so when Augustine figure appeared again in Gordon In the original position, Alman once again collapsed, and the young man who felt that he could not feel the volatility of the huge magical nuisance hurt the soul of a glorious tulip magician with a miracle that transcends common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Still not a high-level magic skill."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Alice walking to the railing The sage Carver gave his precise explanation for the first time. The threshold between the tulip magician and the magician was far higher than the threshold between the high-order sword daisy and the tulip magician. The old man said with emotion. "I have heard from the Dean of St. Donald that there are countless veins intertwined by two invisible lines of latitude and longitude. Only a few of them have meaningful existence. If you find them, you can find shortcuts to space. But no one can give a reasonable systematic explanation for this. Even if there are a lot of magical classics in Morgan College, there is not even a written record of related small pieces of paper. It seems that there is a great magician in the rumored gorse dynasty. I’ve been studying this for decades, and it’s unclear what’s going on. Miss Alice, please pay attention to the position of Helen’s from the position of the young magician in the interchange position, which should be two small magical arrays that are not recorded in the book. If I don't have Wrong, the funny magician who seems to be only under 30 degrees of magic has stayed at the beginning of Helen’s position, creating the simple magical array for the 'jumping'. Oh, my old man can’t help it. Jumping down to study the little guy at his feet, maybe it’s enough for me to write a paper that will be of interest to the genius of the Torch.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;戈Deng Chong to Augustine's position, immediately relying on instinct to turn around, and when Old Carver explained the cause and effect for Miss Alice, Augustine has already spread his hand, the palm of his hand reveals two red and black spheres that are far more dazzling than the first magic, the sphere The periphery is intertwined with a staggering white lightning vein, especially the left hand with a red glove. The red sphere is extraordinarily gorgeous, even those who do not even support a basic magic can completely ignore the landowners who are aware of this small The gadget is definitely a horrible weapon. Before the audience realized this, Gordon had already begun to move forward. His rich experience told him to give it to one. A full-fledged magician has enough time to commit suicide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gordon’s idea is not wrong, but at the crucial moment when he is still 2 meters away from the bounty hunter’s “zone of God”, the black staff in front of Hera Bolsefele and the two hands in Augustine’s hands. The spheres produced an amazing "resonance". A lightning energy pulse emerged from the longan at a speed unrecognizable to the naked eye. The two spheres finally merged into a beautiful floating triangle. Gordon was close to Augustine, a thick white lightning energy pulse. On the outbreak of red and black, the slightly dazzling "whip" directly hit the chest of the golden lion Gordon with agile coefficient, and hit the strong lion back to the center of the triangle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin "jumps" into the magical array under the Titan Longan Staff, one hand on the epic dragon's eye from the strongest dragon. Looking up and finally looking at the Helen heir, who is no longer an elegant smile, but a look of surprise, and then glanced at the "woman of Zeus" in the center of the column, the meaning of the eyes can only be experienced by smart people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the sissy aristocratic master is definitely one of the tallest in the legal orange auction, so he first understood the youth magic downstairs. The teacher’s intention is to use the life of the gold lion Gordon in exchange for the ownership of Hera Bolsefele. A noble aristocrat who has a beautiful face smiles, one hand picks up the glass and the other hand sticks out. Signaling Augustine is self-contained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He obviously does not believe that a magical array can imprison and even kill the Helen family's kittens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin gently sneered, his throat moving slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest and most direct shock is of course Hera Bolsefele, black magic? Variation of small gamma surgery? Taboo arcane? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is an 11th-level arcane who doesn't have a bit of water, so Augustine makes people suffocate the darkness, she almost accepts it, it's like this inquisition came out The man stripped her coat a little bit, especially the last one, which made Hera almost desperate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is telling her: You are mine, and your end will be more miserable than being the trophy of Knight Rheinham. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the whole law orange has experienced an unforgettable scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All powerful magicians, including Old Carver and Yalman, instinctively develop a defensive shield of size and thickness based on their ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
