The key to the problem is that I have no ability to make the skeleton rich, and no one can take it. The chess piece on the countertop, even if I have this labyrinth, I have no way to play even one tenth of its potential in a short time. According to my initial setting, I should need 3 to 4 prisons, the same. The number of research laboratories, used to study black magic, red gamma and scorpion, and a comprehensive section, plus two libraries collecting all kinds of heretical books, a beastly arena, confessional room , Saints Church, I have two or three pages of detailed information for each project. As for the general interrogation and supervision room, the combat department, the preparatory section, the inspection department, and the secretariat, the theoretical department, the intelligence office, and the foreign affairs bureau. When I am a permanent institution, I don't want to fall. You may not know that when I was a child, I liked to play chess with a dead fat man." Augustine smiled bitterly. "I don't need to marry you, there are three organizations that focus on it. One is the strategic reserve room, one It is the Garden of Eden, the last one of its own. It is all set up on the ordinary Swan Lake Manor. Now it seems that if you want to play the full function of the underground labyrinth, at least the prison, the laboratory and the Garden of Eden. Can increase by more than twice. In this way, I will find that the ideal is not only far away, but also out of reach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Augustin, I can later Helping you in charge of the prison?” Elizabeth took the initiative to filter out the parts she was not interested in. Her mind was full of cute pets running around in the cage, and of course only in her eyes could they be cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't show up in front of the public." Augustine refused, there was no room for bargaining, because she was the hand of a few cards that he could save at a critical moment. Although Elizabeth at this stage is still a cub in the crouching period, she is almost a life-threatening character with unlimited potential, not to mention that she has two small reptiles that can advance to the top of the bio-chain. Unfortunately, there are One does not know where she is hiding. Augustine is not clear from the beginning to the end that the "Miss" who is in the top ten of the Vatican's Tingan Black List is only subtly determined that she now only has 5 magicians. The comprehensive strength of the 4th-level knight and the 4th arcian and mid-level gamma, if separated, she is only a top-ranking level in the eunuch, can be combined, if not a single field beyond her at least two orders of magnitude The opponent can't be fatal to her. Augustine is a level certificate appraisal madman. After leaving the seminary and lurking in the Ministry of the Priestess, he took a lot of certificates, but unfortunately The level is average, but the exposure is enough to shock the world. In the history of the empire, the great generalist who passed the 9 or more main functions and level 3 is less than double digits. Now Augustine is only 24 years old and has completed two-thirds of the bottom line of this feat. If there is no accident, he still has at least forty or fifty years to create a miracle. The problem is that there have been too many accidents in Augustine’s short life in 24 years. Now the empire has a special gambling. When the huge amount of gambling evaporating from the world, three-fifths of the bets are pressing this new giant will die within half a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you think I will give you the opportunity to refuse? I just throw a view in the audience. As for whether you promise or not, it is harmless and insignificant." Elizabeth's mouth evokes a standard aristocratic arc, filled with nobles. Arrogant and savvy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine can’t help but talk to her, don’t have the right chips, don’t want her to bow and tame, then she’s handed it out to buy Flowers and The Bourbon silver coin of Blood is not that she used a small gamma formula to get out of Augustine's pocket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping into a "room" somewhere, Elizabeth screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the room, it is simply an empty square. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this is not the most amazing thing. She and Augustine’s head are huge crystal-shaped arc-shaped glass, smooth and transparent, that is a A stunned oval. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, they stood at the bottom of the Black Swan Lake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most shocking picture of Augustine's witness to witch astrology at the Prince of Austin's Astrology House and the first sunrise after the Odea Monastery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Augustin, it's mine." Elizabeth muttered to herself that her possessiveness was notoriously terrifying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shook his head and looked up at the green landscape of the lake, and said: "I promised Pandora, give her the same gift."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth frowned, and there was no entanglement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you." Augustine softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks to a few Caesar gold coins?" Elizabeth snorted, apparently this time out of Augustin's unexpected concessions was not easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it is not worth a few gold coins, it is worth cherishing." Augustine chuckled, licking Elizabeth's small head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth licked his mouth but did not refute it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official Augustin, who has only one ordinary priesthood, looks up at the lake like an opal and mutters: "There is a child born in a world with a dragon, a magical princess and a knight. I am very lucky. Have an elegant father, a beautiful and intelligent mother, and an old butler who likes to put him on his neck. His childhood is very interesting, a witch who is alive may be a longer than his grandfather’s grandfather. How to pass the threshold of magic, so his years are ordinary but not mediocre, and he has not suffered much, but he can open his eyes to look at this strange city and country. Then he grows up and welcomes the godfather like the sea like a mountain. He spent his teenage years at the monastery closest to God. When he just felt that he could master a small part of the world, the beautiful witch teacher had already left him, quiet in the esoteric magical world, and the godfather gave up the animal husbandry. The first scepter, his parents also chose to go to the guillotine with the family. At that moment, the child knew that in this world, in addition to himself, he still needs He went to do everything he could to protect. Originally, his biggest dream was to write a thousand-page world travels, travel all continents, walk like mountains, markets, churches, palaces and cemeteries like a troubadour. ** In the house of ladies, knights, elves, heretics, and civilians, he later had an ideal that he had the most gold coins, became the strongest knight or magician, mastered the greatest power, and finally, when the ideal became ambition, he It also became a calm madman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth sighed softly, holding Augustin’s slightly cold hand and said: "This is really a wonderful story, so I Make sure you are not suitable for a bard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up, but did not see a young face that was expected to be lost, but a firm The deep face of the meteorite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rotong Childe has no retreat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old empire is the most prominent in the east The young aristocrats subconsciously clenched their hands, and the little hand of Elizabeth, who is still very weak, felt painful, but she did not resist at all, her brows did not wrinkle, and the bloody and noble shaman finally understood why human females always showed up. The general weakness of other races is puzzling, but occasionally it can produce amazing energy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps on the vast territory, only the unreasonable human male can show the dignity that does not match the power to the greatest extent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth hesitated for a moment, whispered: "I know that you hate many people, I just want to know this, do you hate that person?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
