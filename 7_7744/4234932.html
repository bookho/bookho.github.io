			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face is a step closer to Mrs. Quentin, who is more delicate than a girl in the flower season. At this moment, she is only about one meter away from Augustine, but let her The distress is that even if she learns that the Inquisition is going to judge her, she can't easily attack after occupying a dominant position. In the history of the Holy See in the past 50 years, no dignitary can judge the high-level judgment of the Ministry of the Holy Sepulchre. After the actual attack, they can be safe and sound, and most of them are dragged into the torture room and never see the sun again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Quentin, a minor in the Irish Undead Book, quietly tweeted the delicate white little thumbs that wrote "Our ultimate redemption", calming the emotions and trying to save as much as possible. In a deadlocked dialogue, "Do you really want a quiet woman who is doing small business on the Chrysanthemum Witch Street to enter the sacrament and then be purified?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "There are a lot of eyes that are looking at you to see if I am qualified to stand in the White Elephant Castle. Are the young and beautiful Mrs. Quentin willing to let them down?" Augustine also stepped forward, the two separated. Less than half a meter, his eyes are different, he almost whispered the mystery in the ear of Mrs. Quentin's ear, and relatives such as lovers told the whisper of Acacia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Despicable." Mrs. Quentin snorted, and the graceful figure conforming to all the sensations of the stunner quickly withdrew, sliding back a distance on the ground, it was difficult Imagine the cumbersomeness of the chest and the amazing agility in an instant. Her simple but not boring exquisite dress has a broken chest position, and the ivory white tube top that wraps in the waves and is slightly weak is crumbling, and the glamorous style is unobstructed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that her left hand has a memorable weapon that is different from a long gun or a knight’s sword, and can’t even be classified as a swordsman’s sword. The four-handed Solomon-style knives worn by the mysterious warriors in the auction are amazed, but the special metal weapons in Mrs. Quentin’s hands are even more secluded, similar to the “hybrids” of short spears and daggers, and the front blades are intertwined with several random movements. Red and black two kinds of lightning, it is this kind of hybrid that helped Mrs. Quentin to resist Augustine’s unexpected blow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young magician still keeps his hands condensed with big element balls, red fire element balls, black water element balls, fire and water are not single elements. It is one of the best states that are presented after the integration of many cumbersome basic elements. Like the lightning, it belongs to the Gabriel sequence. It is a golden form that allows a single element to be superimposed and exerts maximum energy, and some oysters are included. And gamma can condense metal out of thin air, even dark gold, but it requires quite complicated singing and hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine bowed his head and looked at the two spheres created by his hands with his gloves. The diameter of the two spheres reached 40 centimeters, four times the peak of the previous peak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is a masterpiece of his reliance on the Titan Longan Staff, amazing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Quentin rushed forward, not straight, but the s-shaped sleek forward, like a fierce wild cat with a light footstep, the hybrid weapon finally faded away from the residual lightning Influence, revealing sharp edges. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knights, samurai or bounty hunters, and a magician who is not powerful to invincible, pulling a distance of one meter is equal to the victory at your fingertips. Close one meter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin didn’t have the chance to give her a melee, the red and black spheres sputtered two dazzling lightnings of the thickness of one arm, one of which greeted the rushing Kun Mrs. Ding, the location of the pre-judgment is extremely accurate, almost equal to seeing the seemingly chaotic and forwardful route of Mrs. Quentin’s, and another red lightning madly and violently ascends into the dome of the hall, then suddenly slams down and slams into the shape of black lightning. Mrs. Quentin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our final salvation, from the Queen of Dorothy who is in charge of the death and the tomb. I chose to surrender to you and give the servant a break from the spear of San Carlo. Source."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin, who insisted on not exposing heresy, looked at the black lightning that crashed like a giant, frowning, quickly recitation, right hand The dark golden rune of the thumb bursts brightly, and seven ancient books that are nearly transparent are presented to her. It is the seven undead books of the Irish Undead Book, and the seven undead books contain two great destructions. The lightning flashed to the front of Mrs. Quentin, and surrounded her in the center of the circle, from flat to erect, each sacred sacred undead book spread out one page, successfully blocking the rapid flash of two lightning Crash. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the spiritualized Irish undead books were bombarded with lightning, and the remaining five books of the undead were swirling behind Mrs. Quentin, and she continued Rushing, trying to kill the dead magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the colorful bombing, it seems that the pair of heavy chests on her chest is the most attractive sight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sinking? Not tired? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine's mouth sneered a sneer, waiting for the poetry brother castle, into the cosmo that the empire's dignitaries were scorned, he felt the need to liberate and comfort the toy that must be excellent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin has only four meters away from Augustine after the second sprint, plus the unknown hybrid cold weapon, she is already alert and confident. After pulling the distance of two meters this time, I will no longer be attacked by the unreasonable guy. The style like her assassin and bounty hunter is very good for distance and control. Although I don’t understand The reason for Augustine’s standing origin is that Mrs. Quentin is not willing to give up this opportunity. The intuition tells her that the young consuls who have improved nuclear capacity but are not too exaggerated are supplementing the nuclear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the deadly weakness of the magician who has been seriously criticized by the other major occupations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the support of ample nuclear power, a physical stamina is a strong magician in front of the assassin and bounty hunter’s butcher’s knife, a mouse that is being slaughtered. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only 3 meters left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin narrowed her eyes, waiting for a fatal blow to Augustine and his dying struggle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, she does not want this child to die prematurely, but does not exclude him from dying in her hands. After all, this dark giant mind bag in infancy can There are countless Caesar gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 meters! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin came to a beautiful and gorgeous 90-degree turn with instinctiveness. Sure enough, Augustine was flying in front of the lightning bolt that reached the diameter of two meters. Directly draw the ground with the map of the southeastern part of the Holy Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning, Mrs. Quentin was about to harvest the skull a second before retracting the weapon that was about to be stabbed, one side rolling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second lightning bolt of the same size slammed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat Mrs. Quentin was scared and didn’t give her the time to speculate on the extent to which Augustine’s nuclear capacity was expanded, Articles 3 and 4. The lightning column was almost at the same time at her feet, and each one was a poor one. It was a thrilling, and the map hall of the art was opened by the four large lightning bolts of Augustine. Mrs. Quentin retired as if she were forced to play a cat-catching game. Finally, she was completely provoked with anger. She kept her half-squatting posture, looked up and stared at the calm-looking guy in the distance. Her right hand with a dark golden rune on her thumb suddenly clung to the ground, 5 Irish undead books with mysterious power. Protecting the top of the head, because she knows that the 5th lightning column will inevitably turn to this position, silently recite the spell, and pray to the Queen of Gama, Holy Dorothy: "The great Queen of the Undead, the servant Quentin - Florence begged you for me. Raise the tombstone of the sinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightning was actually blown to the book of the undead in her expectation, and after the roar of the eardrum, an energy wave radiated in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost simultaneously, Augustine erected five tombstone-like stones, 3 meters high and 2 meters wide, full of spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful hall was completely devastated at this moment and almost became a ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Quentin looked to the center of the five dead stone tombs in the center, closed her eyes, added gravity, the arm that clung to the ground fell deep One inch, Shen Sheng: "Accept the sigh of the undead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five tombstones are piled up together, and they are blasted into powder in an instant, and they are still clean in the first few minutes. Gorgeous hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dust settled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not the bloody body of Augustine, but a young, consul-in-chief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The observers hiding behind the scenes can't help but make a slight or heavy exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Naughty kitten, it's time to go home." Augustine smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin was in a hurry, but she was not angry and laughed. She stood up and patted the dust, and the voice was flattering. "I can’t catch you, your lightning bolt is also I can't attack me, we just use it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kitty, your master is running very fast." Augustine sneered, blink of an eye Then, the agility that the big knight can break out jumps to Mrs. Quentin, and the latter retreats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that her retreat is not as good as Augustine’s physical strength, like the explosion, and her back is in awkward time. Several lightning bolts were smashed, and her space was completely sealed. The two people were pulled to two meters in an instant. This is really a funny picture, a young man who is considered a pure magician. In front of a small gamma singer who was close to a professional close to an assassin or bounty hunter at a stunned speed, he was affixed to the abdomen by two super-sized magic balls. Augustine looked at the erroneous angel face and smiled: " Obedient."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two black and black magic balls sizzle, entangle and bloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin’s pupils shrink, but they can’t resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;砰! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the White Elephant Castle, the symbolic and powerful Lady Quentin was bombarded by Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most horrifying thing is that before Mrs. Quentin’s landing, there is another extraordinarily thick lightning chain that descends from the sky, just a beautiful woman who would have hit the hall wall. Give it directly to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not only the time when the tenacious Lady Quentin wants to struggle to get up, the lightning bolts that follow one after another, the only remaining Irish undead book "Helen's Graveyard Notes" is also smouldering. The little dress that is not cheap is the only one that can cover some sensitive parts. The two slender thighs exposed to the field of vision and a part of the plump chest are so white that people can swallow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the scenes, some of the black aristocrats who watched the whole drama were involuntarily scalp tingling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bloody means, only the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of Health can do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dew estate will certainly not let the situation worsen without a lower limit, immediately rushing out a group of about 20 Greenspan’s high-order 扈 from the knight , headed by two powerful court dragon knights, watching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a row of stained glass windows on the wall near the cliff, which was suddenly crushed by a huge head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white giant python with an estimated length of at least ten meters vomits a scarlet tongue, and the head and a torso are thrown into the hall in a destructive manner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the white scorpion sits a little girl who is more delicate than any doll princess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glass slag of a place, squatting on the ground floor of the hall, is a gorgeous and thrilling and memorable scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of knights with big eyes open their mouths and dare not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
