			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little song didn’t have a name at first, but was later named by Elizabeth as "The Song of Little Muse", when she taught Augustine Red Gama Equestrian After asking for the reward, Augustin, who was ashamed of the bag, had to bite the scalp. According to some of the gorse ballad passages that he had heard from his mother and the shards of the Principality of the Principality of the Principality, with his acquaintance with a flash of light, he finally put this little tune. I gave it to me, but Elizabeth always liked to tamper with the lyrics and turn all the protagonists into her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complete "Little Muse" should be:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lost the black rose thorn It’s a cute little shaman; who sent the coffin music box, is the timid Augustine, oh ah?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is hiding the pink lipstick jar, It’s a pure little Loli; who throws a long sword and a shield, is poor Augustine, oh Lala?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is throwing a plasma crystal bottle, is Elegant little lady; who owes the candy cross, is Augustin who has no money, oh Lala?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who smeared the gorse foundation, it was beautiful Little Queen; who wears a sable flower pocket watch, is a funny Augustine, oh Lala?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great Elizabeth, with a small Augustine, tired Look at the stars in the thorns. When you are sleepy, you will rest your feet in the smoke. When you die, you will cuddle each other on the battlefield. Oh, Lala?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You sing It’s really ugly.” Elizabeth finally stopped crying. , He complained. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Rarely sing once, don't know the implicit praise." Augustine snarled, gently helping the little housekeeper wipe the tears and the dust on his body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Loli" that is occupied by the big shaman and is actually a little princess who was left two hundred years ago and deposited in the Muse mainland. Because Elizabeth's shaman is not an ordinary meaning of encroachment on the level of martial arts, her soul must be fully integrated with this legendary innocent body. Augustine has been fighting with her to this day. She has no longer regarded her as a bloody shaman, but a little housekeeper who deserves his care regardless of the cost. She may be angry for no reason, and she will be unreasonably unreasonable. Spoiled, but Augustine is very impatient on the surface, in fact, I hope that she can always be simple and easy to go simple, every day is to read the "fairy flowers and blood" such a no-frills best-selling books, rather than calculating the Vatican's Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she is really just a sly ghost that Augustine owes her a few bourbon silver coins, it is impossible to take the risk of interrupting the key stage of the evolution of a gold subspecies pet. This risk is by no means a pile of hills like Caesar gold coins. Can be simply estimated, and in fact she has done so, the Nile white nicknamed "Little Girl" in her hands is like a "little boy" black Mamba snake into the early "hibernation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to clean the battlefield, and said yes, except for the two great knights who were cleared by the nephew, two alchemists and the wicked duke-level division. It’s my personal trophy. They have the ownership, research and domination rights of the big knight Descartes. Only the last right to use can be divided into a little bit for you!” Elizabeth put the Nile small white scorpion close to the pocket After jumping up, I crossed my waist, with faintly visible tear marks, and my face returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin laughed, but his heart was full of distress, one could hard The three Nash's cards, the Nile River, were so sleepy as the Prince Dimit, and they felt distressed for Elizabeth, and there was also a concern that the number of cards in the hands was reduced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level setting of the epic sergeant is very unique and very interesting. Similar to the human aristocracy, it has a total of 7 levels. The Green Baron, Huang Zijue, Black Earl, Blue Marquis, Red Duke, and the last top prince, as for the world's most sacred priests, will have a special name, epic mainland generally every half century There will be a singular emperor with the same talent and luck, like the recent one who almost independently supported a kingdom of the Principality who was not annexed by the Titans. In addition to his strength, he also had the luck to let the rest of the division collapse. Because in his hands, in addition to controlling a young Caroline dragon captured from the Muse mainland, there is also a rumor that the body is a big taboo for angels and human descendants. It is this old guy who is so lucky that it is in the Caucasus. In the region, the weak Sala Principality can calm down in the gaze of the Titan Empire and become a commercial paradise that rejects the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who can let old Rome get out of the Caucasus, I will give him half a Sarah Principality." This is a complaint of Prince Titan, the Prince of Titan, at a military conference. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that in a Caucasus battlefield full of unknowns, the three old priests who are impossible to defeat, who have the strength to go with the baby dragon and The co-owner of half an angel is called a board? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old monster’s response to Prince William was a sinister speech that made historians fall through the glasses: “Which bastard can teach William’s daughter Barbara as a female slave, and I send him a dragon.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard of the various versions of the civilians have to be so emotional, absurd perverted high society. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was young, I dreamed of catching a dragon. When I was riding, the young Augustine was eager to try, but for now, his most important thing is to hurry and meet at any time. The next wave of offensives, because of the imperial power that can go to the table to try to kill [order], must be an old fox with deep and well-calculated family, knowing how to give a "fatal shot" after flirting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Augustine got up and let Hera and Ares help to drag the bodies that are good for Elizabeth and the horns back to the underground of the castle. It seems that the horn will be very busy next, because its new owner will throw the bodies of two great knights and five great mages in one breath. The ground part of the poetry castle, which was flattened after the end of the battle, is golden. The cost of destruction is expected in Augustine. The only dissatisfaction may be that the young knights have survived and witnessed the power of Elizabeth and the nephew. This is a good thing and a bad thing. The entangled Augustine has only a few The cronies went back to the ground, ignored the shocked horns laboratory, and returned to the study room to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth has told Ares to move fresh toys to her private lair on the 8th floor, at the Alpha Dunkee Market she left Augustine I bought a lot of materials, enough to let her vent anger at the three poor worms who didn’t die enough for 10,000 times. Augustine didn’t want to imagine what monsters they would become in the hands of Little Loli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herrah, who is obviously faster than Augustine, once again became a maid to help him massage, but this time she is willing to do a lot, experienced this setback, Hera The [family loyalty] has risen geometrically, although scholars have been trying to quantify the source of belief in the eight main systems, but no one has been able to give sufficient theoretical data. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are you going to do next?" Hera asked softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have no cards to shoot, and then a wave of opponents of the same size can seduce the underground castle to fight the streets, but unfortunately that [Sjiati Soul Elegy] I spent half of my time in this period, and most of the rest were drawing detailed maps of these floors. In addition to the study and the labyrinth of the 3rd floor, some small magic arrays were created, which only allowed the enemy to pass unimpeded."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine regrets, closing his eyes, he likes the feeling of being full again after every time he is ruthless, although it is so painful and painful, but it is very fulfilling, and many paranoid magicians who pursue efficiency also like to use this way. Expanding the nuclear capacity, like a spring, must be stretched enough to get a satisfactory range, of course, if you don't break the spring, he is relieved. "Now we can wait for the horns to give me two excellent bones. Knight, the Cavaliers above level 10 make awkward undead, it is a pity, the skeleton knight is the best choice, increase the strength but retain a certain IQ, this is a qualified weapon. As for the 5 tulip magicians and big arcane Home may also be in the hands of nuclear weapons, Master dolls have not been the mainstream of the real battlefield, only their fancy performances will appear in the arena, there is no practical reference value."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin indicated that Hera helped him to lick his temples and continued to talk to himself. "It seems that no matter how the children understand the drawing, they must pull to the ground. The squad is involved in the construction of the 12 martial arts magic array. You must pay attention to this point, that is, don't let anyone touch the drawings of the whole magic circle. I will give you the pattern, you will split it, and each person will have a copy. And each one has to disrupt the order, and strive to achieve the speed of a sub-magic array for two and a half days. The rough is rough, and then fill and plump later, there is no time to squander. You are not only supervising the Knights and the Magic Array. In my free time, I will help you to make some magical arrays that you are familiar with on the first floor of the underground. The principle is only one point. You must have low requirements for nuclear weapons, but the destructive power is enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay." Hera nodded, and instead of facing a male master alone and uneasy all day, it was better to join the heavy work day and night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If possible, there will be a large number of institutions in the future [order], and there will be some changes in the sacramental department. I intend to let you be responsible for the Knights and the Olympics in the future. Two of the labs, you can now prepare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin whispered, drawing a rough cosmo structure and handing it to Hera," I must remind you that the Knights are listed as the three organizations that I attach the most to the strategic reserve room and the Garden of Eden, but now the Knights are not the ones I recognize, so you should not be on the low-end potential of the group. The Cavaliers are betting too much. In my ideals, the number of knights in cosmo should be around a thousand, and the lowest should be high-ranking knights. The base is around 900. The 50 knights, 16 or above. There are 10 knights and at least two to three sacred knights. Only such a knight can compete with the top ten knights outside the Empire’s two main knights. It’s crazy, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera nodded gently, with her rare gentleness: "But it's ridiculous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I haven't created [order], the northernmost land One of his peers has already begun to control an empire, and tried to reverse the head of a red Junker giant bear, and this guy is still a woman, it is so frustrating to think about it." Augustine laughed. His so-called peers, together with the great emperor of Judit, became the latest emperor's playing card symbolizing the power of the [square] head card. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can she succeed?" Because everyone is a woman who is regarded as a heresy by their respective churches, Hera is not disgusted with the unattainable Queen of Wonders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know. She is on the toughest path, changing the trend of an empire from the most fundamental beliefs and institutions, she also said, 50 In the year, one country can adapt to this change at most. The next 150 years is the key to the success of this change. What she has to do is to live to 100 years old and train a successor to let Junker’s giant bear follow her plan. The huge inertia that came out rushed forward.” Augustine said with emotion. “It can be seen that she is not simply a politically naive paranoia. A person may be able to usurp the rule of an empire for decades, but wants to turn the empire It is unrealistic. It really takes several generations of people to work together. If there is a chance, I must meet with the Queen of Wonders and ask her how to prevent herself from becoming a complete madman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hella shook her head helplessly, and the last sentence was a joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hera, are you a goddess in Saxon?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin suddenly asked, turn Looking at the woman who is incomprehensible, she gives an explanation, "It is the kind of woman who can make a man mad by showing a courtesy smile."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hera closed her mouth and did not intend to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One day, maybe you will become the knight of the Holy Empire." Augustine laughed and then laughed at himself, it seems that he himself is also very Look at this wonderful idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hella is indifferent to this, too far away. As always, the little Augustine-style "crazy but not laughable" joke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
