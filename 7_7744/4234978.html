			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests in the train are very interesting and talkative, and there is no such thing as the boring arrogance of all the foreign county people in the county, but from the northern part of the empire. The two ladies in the county did not have the inferiority of the small aristocratic family, so the next conversation was easy and enjoyable. The young priest who claimed to have only been to the emperor three or four times said a lot of anecdotes, and the Mena family lady also I took the initiative to talk about the customs of the province of Richelieu, and the gentle pride in the words. Finally, under the reminder that the butler could not conceal the excitement, the mother and daughter of the nobles opened the curtains and looked at the majestic city of Jupiter. The main city wall, inevitably can see the tallest building in the city, the Edward III chapel, stands a huge sculpture only known to the theologians and senior believers, called St. Urban, and the lady sitting back to pick up a carry-on Poetry collection, reading low, quiet and patient, exuding the radiant radiance of intellectual women, Miss T. Lisi also took the time to review a magical official textbook, reporting that there will be a scene immediately after enrollment Written test grid, and she did not want to hometown high hopes for her magic union humiliated, she was determined to get a good graduation, determined to become a woman tulip magician. The priest inadvertently glimpsed the title of the thick poetry collection in his wife's hand, "The Eyes of the Blind", very interesting, hesitated and asked: "Mrs, can you read it for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The lady hesitated a moment and handed her a priest who had always been impressed by her. She smiled and said: "This collection of poems was only secretly circulated in our province of Richelieu, and was brought from the side of the Kay Empire. Our Chief Executive of Richelieu is having a headache whether to list this collection of poems as a banned book, because the protagonist of the poetry collection is the honorary knight of the Rotongschild family, but it is said that the sir is actually the collector of this collection of poems. , so it is a headache."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest took the poetry collection and was amazed and asked: "Is it an epic to praise the heroic deeds of the Cavaliers?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady shook her head and said softly: "The author of the poetry is a blind, unknown bard, only known as Homer, and our readers like to call the collection of poems Homer. Epic. This poem is not about how the protagonist made it. The feat of man, on the contrary, is just a trivial little thing. The poems are divided into two volumes, a total of 12,000 lines. The scroll tells the story of a white-browed dynasty who was born in the Gregory province of Gregory. After that, I have been in exile in a few kingdoms for 20 years. I believe that if you can patiently read the scroll, you will be touched. Maybe this poor and shabby can only be worn by the protagonist who wears the old armor and rides the old Hummer. A great thing, but he is indeed a knight with a firm belief. The next volume is even more exciting. When he met the young heirs of the Rotundchild family in the capital of Fetukohna, he did not Enjoy a restful life under the protection of sable flowers, but leave alone, walk on the epic continent, and try to help every poor and victim with his unique knight rules. He persisted for ten years until he died. Old and sick. Before the dying of the knight, the last blind man, Homer, who was helped by him, was a lonely bard. After listening to this name, he did not insult the two families of Frederick and Rotonchild. The well-known old knight’s serene complaints, so he wrote this touching "Blind Eyes". Oh, forgot to say that the knight who still remembers to wipe the sable flower badge before death is called Don Quixote. It is an ordinary but never mediocre great knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priests held a thick but not heavy collection of poems, and their hands trembled slightly. Showing a dignified emotion that makes the lady puzzled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That year, he was just a nobleman who had just left Augsburg to meet a new chapter, and there was the godfather Iyta, who was still the Archbishop of Red at the time. The accompanying care, in the faint memory, the surviving knight who was afraid of insulting the glory of the Frederick family and flowing into the sacred empire, is a funny robber riding a rusted short spear with a rusty iron spear, a huge helmet, a fat armor, It’s so ridiculous, the only thing that can’t be laughed at is the old knight’s obstinacy, so he chose to include him in the ranks of Rothschild’s honorary knight. It’s just an insignificant little move, not even expecting this to be someone else. An axe easily pulls the helmet out of a hole and the knight is really loyal to the aster flower. But it was this old-aged knight who escorted a nobleman to the monastery of Oyola, and left silently. With the rest of his life, countless adventures and dedications, he won the defeat for Luo Tong. The sacred sense of imagination proves the true meaning of the aster flower and the first flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a veteran and I refuse to leave the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers are not thankful. The veteran is not dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk looking out the window at the sunset opened his lips and turned to ask: "Mrs, do you know where the knight is buried? Is this book of poetry?" Have you documented?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady of the Mena family regrets: "No. But at the end of the collection, the Cavaliers borrowed from the blind poet Homer's goose indirect The heir to the Rothschild family said, 'Master Augustine, you said that there is a fool in the world who also called Don Quixote, who regards the windmill as a dragon and will record the horse. The book is the Bible, and the kind girl in the small village will be regarded as a princess. This is the most touching story that the old man Ji Jinde has ever heard. He likes to read the book, Master Augustine, good night.'"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Liss, who has read the "Blind Eyes" word by word, every time she sees the end, she has to face tears, and today is no exception, he whimpered: "The original we Li The province of Sereu County is very hated by the treason of the Rotongschild family, but now we all believe A family with Don Quixote will never be treasonable! I also believe that the original Augustine, who was always smashed into a swaying aristocrat, is the noblest aristocrat, the most devout priest!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady sighed softly, her eyes were wet, and nodded: "Everyone who has read the poetry of the Richelieu County believes this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richelieu is the poorest county in the empire. The land is poor and resources are scarce. This has led many high-ranking priests to go to the east as an archbishop and not to be a bishop in Richelieu. And generally speaking, the chief executives of a county are all fat and fat, but the two southern counties of the Titans’ iron hoofs, and the province of Richelieu, which requires a lot of financial support from the empire every year, are Recognized chore. At the annual meeting of the Imperial Governors, the chief executive of the province of Richelieu, who had no borders and no gold coins, was always the least able to speak. Even a small middle-level official of the Imperial Capital Department dared to sneer at him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting in the corner of the carriage, try to give most of the position to the two ladies' priests to say a strange word that they didn't hear clearly or didn't put it in their hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up to ten years, I will bring to the rich province of Richelieu."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compartment The slightly crowded but neat and refreshing carriage drove into Jupiter. This is the sixth largest city on the epic continent, with a population of one million. This is much more than the entire population of some small Principality cities. Any emperor is the face of the kingdom. As a sacred empire that almost jumped into the continent's richest. The main road of Jupiter City is spacious and striking, and the two ladies who came back to the Imperial Hub are stunned. All kinds of luxury carriages with the noble family badges pass by. At first, the lady also interested her daughter. Interpretation "Brillis, this carriage is the Cleef family, this family is rich in famous magicians", "Look, this is the carriage of the Margaret family, the winter coral badge is very beautiful, very artistic, Isn't it?" Later, the husband's population was dry, stopped to introduce, realized that some of the gaffes, a little embarrassed to look at the real master of the carriage, saw that he did not notice this behavior that did not meet the aristocratic identity, loose Tone. When the lady rested, Tirlis, who had been keeping her eyes open for all sorts of new things, couldn’t help but swear: "Mother, Caesars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caesar door. It is the landmark of the glory of the Empire. Only the heroes who triumphed for the Empire can pass through Caesar. The men who have passed through here are all heroes who have entered the history of the empire. The family of the Rotongschild who passed down the thirteenth generation, who passed through seven places, including the imperial army in history as a dragon slayer, has a handful of numbers within the empire, both in proportion and in number. Therefore, the Luotongzilder family, whose branches and leaves are not flourishing, was able to settle in the empire's first-line family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two men who have recently won such honors in the history of the Empire are Prince Odis. And discover Napoleon of the Gospel continent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former life was full of inconspicuous thoughts. It was once the greatest warrior of the empire. He rode his arms across Caesar's Gate and was the biggest traitor of the empire. His head was hung up with the highest statue of St. Urban. The latter is all the way to the road, the future is bright, just like the warm smile of the sun on the face of the big priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage is automatically detoured with all the vehicles. Who dares to drive straight in? Do you want to be cut off from the big Mary guillotine by the executioner of the Dongsong family? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the greatest joy of the upper class of the Imperial Capital, the young Nero of the Pompeii family. The big family's inflection heirs were drunk shortly before, and bet with a group of Jupiter City aristocrats. As a result, the Nero Master who has been making a chat to the Emperor for the last three years has won a dinner with a little princess. Right, then the white robe shepherd dog of the Holy Spirit ruling court went to the door that night, asked to bring it back to torture, passed a field, and then directly sent to the guillotine according to a special law of the empire. Fortunately, there was an nickname behind the young Master Nero. The empire family of the empire has a general father who holds the real power. A row of high-level 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 龙 龙 龙 龙 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 佩戴 龙 佩戴 佩戴 龙 龙 佩戴 龙 龙 龙 龙 龙 龙 龙 龙 龙 龙 龙 龙 龙 龙 龙<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hot and overly violent incident almost directly led to a large-scale direct conflict between the military and the Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hawkish generals who commanded the jihad and southern border wars later hand-held the helmet and went to the palace to plead guilty to Jupiter, but when the wrathful emperor It is preparing to obey the public opinion, especially the emergency moment when some conservative ministers will take over the military power of Pompey’s family. Another ridiculous thing happened. The cute Nero master who is the most famous poet in the epic mainland. I went to Caesar's Gate again, read aloud the confession of my own work, listened to many tens of thousands of people, and thundered, because his words were very interesting, using six-step poetry, without the rhyme, but the rhythm was unexpected. Extremely strong. This kind of poem is clearly created by the young Master Nero for reading or singing. When playing the song, he played the harp to strengthen the rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repentance, to be precise, is a confession that praises all the soldiers, heroes, dragons, and wizards who are qualified to walk through Caesars. The fun reveals the tragic and majestic stocks. The audience and listeners on the Empire Street keep applauding. The vendors selling flowers are grateful for the feat of the great aristocratic master, because his business has skyrocketed ten times. At that moment, Caesar's Grand Gate Square is the ocean of flowers and applause. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
