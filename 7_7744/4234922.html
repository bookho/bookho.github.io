			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I hope that a friend with plenty of time can list the various settings in "God", I will top it.)<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Massaro County is located in the heart of the Empire. In addition to providing entertainment and entertainment to the Emperor's dignitaries, the greatest political responsibility is to defend the empire's central city of Judit, but since the creation of the Holy Empire, Jubitt The city has not ignited a sporadic war, so most of the castles of the Maso County manor show the power and wealth of the castle are pursuing the gorgeous grace of the gorse dynasty, or the delicateness of the Principality of the White Rose, not like the Titan Empire. The military base of Dongdong constitutes a fortress net. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only exception to a castle is that it is like a military fort standing at the apex of the Bayford Mountain Range in the northwest corner of the Marceau County, like a war giant overlooking Marceau In the northwestern part of the county, on the side of the mountain is the beautiful Maso Plain, on one side is the vast Forest of Flensa, and the Black Swan Lake Manor is on the edge of the Maso Plain, also within the vision of the giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majestic castle is built according to the most famous cliffs in the Bayford Mountains. It is easy to defend and difficult to attack. A large balcony on the top of the castle stretches out over the cliff, in this sunny In the days, a young woman wearing a luxurious and bright dress sits in front of a large amethyst table. The chair is a standard Gothic style, with a tall chair back, a candle-shaped spire, a dense and delicate embossed chair back, inlaid with A large number of precious stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table has a character piece similar to the Paya Wars, a magician, an arcaneist, a knight riding a gun, a sword Scholars, etc., all 9 major professional roles, even a large number of heretical characters such as the Dark Sorcerer, the Red Gama Warlock, etc., are all about two centimeters in height, and they are meticulously detailed to each level of the magician. Grade badges or Knight medals are clear, all carved from ivory, together with more than two hundred pieces, such a rare luxury, is not a collection of ordinary nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman is picking up her heels and focusing on 10 grand masters, 7 big knights and 3 heresy chess pieces on the table. The scene, even in line with the original Black Swan Lake, she first divided the team into two batches, said to herself: "According to the information provided by the confidential documents, the poetry brothers are not adequately equipped, so I intend to start again. I doubled the disadvantages of the other party, and the soldiers split the two ways, forcing the poetry brother to accept the facts of the two-line battle. Therefore, I put the Red Duke of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Holy Division plus two high-ranking alchemists to the poetry knight. In the direction of the regiment, the great knights dispatched by the two churches of the Holy See and half of the mages provided by Helen cooperated to create a group of undead knights for the first time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The woman moved the ten pieces in her hand to the position of a group of low-ranking knight characters. The remaining pieces moved to the castle of Shizige, frowning: "According to my plan, this battlefield should be avoided near the poetry brother. To proceed, it must be drawn beyond the circle with a radius of 50 meters centered on Shizige. Unfortunately, this group of chess pieces from the southern big family is not obedient. They choose to step into this circle, and there is no such thing as it seems. The enemy can face the confrontation. If you choose the wrong battlefield location, the correct tactics will become a fatal mistake, and the established delaying tactics will become the fuse of the entire army."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Asa, I told you to make the golden 傀儡 and the 缪斯萨满棋 finished?" The woman stopped her hand and turned her head and smiled at the old butler in the tuxedo behind her. The old man was very strong. The same blonde, if the golden lion's Helen is a young male lion from Gordon, then this savvy butler is a mature but not too late lion, more experienced, his claws More dangerous. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The butler smiled and handed out two beautiful pieces made by the private craftsman who ordered the family, one is a golden 傀儡 character slightly higher than the ordinary chess piece, one cent. The piece is a small shaman that is one centimeter shorter than the ordinary character. After the woman takes the piece, they are placed on two battlefields, staring for a moment, saying: "Old Carver, this magic that is taken away from the entire ground above the poetry brothers castle. What is the name?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Opposite the crystal table, is a royal magician wearing a gold clover medal, he meditates: "It should be uncommon [Sega The Soul Elegy], this magical array is too cumbersome, and it needs to have too many preconditions, and there is no chance to appear on the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But that The young big sergeant still did it, didn't he?" The woman smiled and looked good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Miss Alice." The old magician sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team of this size wants to enter the Black Swan Lake, and must not escape the eyes of the Greenspan family, but Augustine in the underground castle of Poetry is the most vengeful. The indifference between Greenspan and Todd's two families, but they could not think of the specific details of the attack, but Greenspan, a female heir to whom he is very fond of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sect of the sacred ministry, the bishop of the Holy See, or the leadership of the 2nd and 8th leadership, the cardinal knight, plus the tulip magician of the Shanghai Lun family and the south The big knights of several families, it seems that our neighbor Augustine has provoked many great people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice made a "砰" in her mouth, first removed all the pieces that died in [Sketi soul elegy], then smoothed the sand sculpture of the poetry brother, and looked down at the symbolic dark governor Augustine. The chess piece, the ordinary robes, the only thing that may be different is the sable flower badge on the chest of the character's chess piece. In addition to staying at home, trying to create a war game that is more systematic than the Paya war chess, the greatest fun. It’s just a simple woman who looks at some girl books and muttered: “Aunt Quentin really found me a good private magic teacher, I’m afraid I can’t afford it.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "If the lady can stop the retreat of the weakest aristocrats at the last minute, encourage them to push the second force into the hinterland, I want to cooperate with the deployment of the lady, or to be able to take the poetry brother castle." Laughing, not putting all the eggs in one basket is a fine tradition of Greenspan that has been exchanged for countless lives, so the first pieces of chess that were killed in the castle of Poetry, and a hidden secret. The troops used to deal with emergencies, perhaps a [Sgardy Soul Elegy] and an unidentified subspecies dragon that frightened the aristocrats who were watching the balcony at that time, one by one requesting the retraction of the command from Miss Alice. right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I say Greenspan will send troops, they will definitely change their minds, but why should I take the "barbarians" who will only suffer in the eyes of the emperor? 'Drag into the chariot? They want to save their strength and let them save it. I am curious whether they are growing fast or cosmo's growth is fast, etc. [order] is really a day to compete with the trilogy of the sacrament, these obsessions Gambling and those who dare not take risks will taste a big bitter fruit.” Miss Alice chuckled and jumped to the balcony and looked at the Black Swan Lake. “I want him to be my private magic anyway. Teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler looks kind and seems to be very fond of Miss's childishness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Little Alice, even if Mrs. Quentin recommended, the master will not agree." Greenspan chief private magician Carver laughed, because he I have to stay in the Imperial Torch Organization for a long time, so I don't have much time to teach Alice's magic knowledge. In fact, this distinctive Greenspan heir is not a magical genius. The nuclear capacity is not outstanding, but Old Carver likes to follow. The little girl explored some of the tricks about the character setting of the war chess character. Any military strategist understands that the popular Paia in the south of the epic continent and the more extensive dragon warrior in the north mean the perfect combination strategy for the war. And tactics, so simply Miss Alice is doing something that big ambitious homes are afraid to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because he is a consul from Rotong Childe? Is it the public enemy of the empire?" Alice wondered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this not enough?" Old Carver said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, the Empire regards Greenspan as an uncivilized barbarian and has a little friendship with a heir from the most pure ancient family. What is the relationship?" Alice whispered, she might be a clever conductor who was involved in a military deployment to send out one flash after another, but on politics, she was not qualified, and this may also be a military with Greenspan. Inheritance is related to the “barbarians” without too much arduous political cognition, and only one has been consistently implemented in all battlefields – “the Greenspan family is only loyal to the emperor and the next.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is a lady who is so relaxed, there will not be so many nobles coming to our white elephant castle, counted in the eyes of Miss Alice, the handsome governor, after all, after all, Most of the conspirators are not the same as Alice who has seen him. Many of them may not even have seen Augustine, or even just want to step on Luotong Childe." Old Carver smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is really handsome!" Miss Alice said seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, yes." Old Carver joked. "It’s just that the body robe is so bitter."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not like a nobleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice smiled brightly, went to the crystal table, messed up all the pieces, and took out my arms. The ivory sculpture, which is extraordinarily exquisite and luxurious, symbolizes her own, is placed on the castle of Poetry, standing with Augustine. "It’s more like a nobleman than a nobleman. It’s what we do in Greenspan. Anyway, I have to fight for him to be a partner at my Marceau traditional dance. If the family does not agree to pay him to be a family magic teacher, I will save myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The old housekeeper Asa smiled and gratified, the pure lady finally stepped into the threshold of love, the only trick is that the man who took the flower of Greenspan is too sensitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since Little Alice is so persistent, I am also happy to recommend General Augustine to Augustine - Alice's private magic teacher, not Greenspan's family Magician." Old Carver smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
