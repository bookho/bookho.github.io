"Eye" is different from the horns that focus on living experiments on various types of organisms. The sheep's eye is more proficient in various texts and symbols. However, the eye of the sheep has not been able to completely solve the first layer in the poetry. The taboo circle is only to decipher the first six palaces in the 12th ecliptic palace. The mother of the ewe who has never been patient has finally withdrawn the sheep's eye. The Black Swan Lake has also become a secret forbidden place for the Holy See to read. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is a madman, but he has not lost his basic reason. He still hasn’t taken a step forward, just staying on the 9th floor every day, burying his head Measuring the drawing, it is more troublesome than completing the homework of the beautiful private family teacher in childhood, and then let Ares go to the Black Swan Lake to catch some small animals abandoned by the goddess of fate, and bring them to this level to throw into the magic array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being lost, it was torn into pieces by the most peripheral zodiac magic circle, and the flesh and blood was directly pulled into the blood stone monument representing the dark wisdom of the Judah Conference. The weak soul is pulled into the black huge shaman stone. If you throw it a little further, the high-level shaman that will emerge in the spirit state is exactly the same as the entity. Some of them are old shamans. More conservatives with the dwarf Aobei, the conservative younger shaman, were thrown into the magical array of the Necromancer, Elizabeth is also shocking, because many of them have had an intersection with her. There is even no shortage of crazy pursuers who have launched a fierce offensive against her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the 'Little Ram' Krupp, a talented anthropologist on our land, one of the students of the Grand Duke of Maja Black Sheep, determined The anti-racist, who has always publicly confronted the revenge of the dwarf Aobei, did not expect to eventually fall to the point of becoming a puppet."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth has been with Augustine recently Staying on the ground floor, in addition to explaining the details of the three magical arrays to Augustine, and then looking forward to the appearance of the next undead puppet, "Right, why do you call our land "Muse" continent? Which historian is like this? Black humor, the uncultivated land is called Muse, it is the biggest comic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no historical record, maybe it is a certain A bard with complex feelings.” Augustine just copied the last zodiac sign of the Scorpio Palace on the sheepskin roll. In the era when printing was strictly controlled by the upper levels of the empire, expensive paper was not common, and sheepskin Volume is also more suitable for storing important letters Interesting, he sat cross-legged at the bottom of the ladder, and Elizabeth sat in the middle, blonde scorpion Ares just lost a gold cane that can only sell a lot of copper into the magic array, he stood at the top of the ladder, looking at the spirit state The little ram Krupp gradually faded, and finally disappeared into the magic array, the light shines on the boy's stereotyped face, shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My 'order' consul, now we have found the jewel in the crown of this treasure, it has been two weeks, I want to know how to compare the two sacrament giants, the biggest advantage of using your madness is also unique The advantage to break the 'God's left eye'?" Elizabeth sneered ironically, her patience may not be better than that of Haiji adults. It seems that they are such powerful and horrible female creatures that they don't like to fight for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you care most about when you first saw me?" Augustine laughed, picking up the staff lying under his feet and picking it up. A stack of sheepskin rolls, stepped up the ladder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The titan longan wand in your hand, I recognized it at a glance. You later told me that it is a monastery of the Ola Monastery. The gift left by the old royal astrologer, God knows if it is one of the stolen goods that Luo Tongchaide obtained through the dirty channel. I don’t care, I wonder how you can use it. After all, this dragon The eyeball comes from the Titan family, the closest to the gods in the history of the dragon. It is no danger to hold it as an ordinary black crystal. It is necessary to trigger its pupil, not to mention you, I am afraid that any magician below level 20 Or the arcaneists have to be countered, it is definitely not a wonderful disaster." Elizabeth wondered, I am afraid that there are very few characters in the empire that can recognize Augustine's epic magic wand, and the sacrament is high. The giants above the altar should know that some of the Holy See’s old antiques that do not appear easily may be known. In addition, the Rachel’s tiger in the mouth of Haiji’s adult, the second Secretary of State’s “Little Sadi” has nothing to do. know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For me, the meaning of leverage is to let me not do a strong miracle. Miss Elizabeth, you obviously didn't read my last time. The VIII grade document of the National Library of Judit City that was handed over to you, you were studying how to maintain youth in "Flowers and Blood" at the time." Augustine, who is already looking at the scum, is the first to walk out of the "sacred" The bottom layer of inviolability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What did you say above?" Elizabeth asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This was the biggest cancer in the middle of the empire, using countless gold coins and manpower to search for all kinds of longan, Miss Elizabeth, who is both smart and beautiful, you Said, may the dwarf Aobei be an avid longan collector?" Augustine laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth’s eyes turned around, and when she was with Augustine, she became more and more lazy and brainstormed, she exclaimed: “Even if your hypothesis is not wrong, you can Really crazy to jump into the round hole from the top? In case your longan staff can't support the impact of the earth's pulse, Augustine, you will completely disappear from this world! Even the greatest and most versatile Alchemy can't save you from God's left eye!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't I have to squint at you with your eyes, keep the treasure, wait for the enemies in the nobility and the Holy See to launch a round of conspiracy against me? You know, when I arrive at the Black Swan Lake, it means Zhu. The refuge of the great emperor of Beit has been suspended. Then the Emperor’s Majesty no longer cares about my life and death. The behind-the-scenes enemies of the Rotong Chald family do not want me to become the sect of the ruling, and to feel the balance of the ministry. The top executives, as well as the speculators who bet on me to die early, should start to move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stopped and turned to see Elizabeth A face resisted and worried, my heart warmed, gently picking up her little hand, softly said: "Do not worry, I can not easily die, that is too cheap, I have to slowly revenge the guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth shook his head, speechless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't say that I was going to take risks soon." Augustine comforted. "Don't say this, take you to see my prince-level servant. It’s your second meeting.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the study, let Ares stay at the door, Augustine opens the gorgeous quaint coffin, and Elizabeth picks up the heels in the coffin Next to her, her eyes widened. She did not see an middle-aged man who was as elegant as a human aristocrat. It was not the vicissitudes of the old man, the prince-class of the most striking family in the leech13 race, and Gorgeous and classical missed, showing only a dry skeleton in front of Elizabeth's eyes, the flesh and blood torso is severely shrunk, and it can clearly see its protruding bones. The only thing that differs from the corpse is only two points. It is covered with tiny red lines. It flows slowly and regularly, which proves that it is indeed a leech in sleep. The second point is most surprising to Elizabeth. It has competed with the wolves for the hegemonic members of the underground dynasty for thousands of years, and was divided into the chest. Two remain implanted deep red beating heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth has a natural sense of rejection of this heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is the heart of two saints, one is the ancient jewel of the Monastery of Ola, from Saint John and the other is the godfather Leave me a second legacy." Augustine speaks deep and deep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, who can send a bloody prince with two hearts of two saints to sleep?! During the time I was away, you experienced What kind of catastrophe?” Elizabeth shocked. When she met Augustine for the first time, if the guy who was not lying in the coffin was waiting around, Augustine had long been a delicious food for her two odd-sized pets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The more difficult ones among the many enemies." Augustine sneered, re-capped the coffin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When can Timothy wake up?" Elizabeth took a deep breath and she seemed to have to reassess Augustine’s luck, even when she was in perfect condition. Do not dare to say that it can be defeated by Dimit, can it be said that the last time in the Judit City, Haiji adults "courtesy" shot is not his first personal confrontation with the Golden Trident? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unknown." Augustine smiled bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have almost 7 levels of magicians, 5th level knights, 6 arcane artists, and the overall strength of mid-range gamma." Eliza Whiteboard with fingers Calculated, like her usual calculations, Augustine owes her how many silver coins, which makes people feel that the ranks in these fields are as cheap as the bread and vegetables sold by the vendors. She ignores the stagnation of Augustine and says: "Sneakly sneak Going to the shofar, I will make up some of the little skills that I was not interested in before. If Dimitt can wake up at a crucial moment, then the poetry brothers castle and the two cards of me and the little scorpion can still resist. One next call for the intruder's offensive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you sure you are not talking about a joke?" Augustine looked incredulous, "except for gamma, I remember that you only have 5 level magicians, 4 level knights and 4 arcane artists before the Black Swan Lake!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't use your humans Childish cognition comes to Queen Elizabeth Limits to Growth. "Elizabeth squinted split mouth smiled, a Bai Cancan teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affected Augustine slammed down the box that the Duchess had left for him, a bunch of valuable empire top sorcerers hand-drawn scrolls, about 15 volumes, both It is a precious scroll that allows Augustine to easily make 50 levels + even 70+ magic. According to the basic theory of magic, the magic level that he can use increases by 5 levels for each level of the magician level. However, according to the damn marginal degressive efficiency, the 20th-level Royal Society Wizard, in the absence of a top-level scroll or an epic-like staff like Augustine, often controls a level 80 magic is his limit, so these scrolls for Augustine It doesn't just mean that it can be converted into a hill-like Caesar gold coin, but a bundle of life-saving straws, except for the rare scrolls that have been preserved for hundreds of years, and a set of "sigh" levels that a magician dreams of.
