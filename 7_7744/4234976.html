			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin surprises: "Do you know?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man laughed at himself: "Niberon - Root of the heart, of course, know. In the field of magic, in addition to some large ancient magic arrays have not been cracked beyond the posterity of others, in general, the more novel, the more powerful. This is a very normal natural law, whether it is a wizard or a knight This is the case. There are very few giants and peaks that cannot be surpassed. The magical array that you draw is the peak of the last two hundred years. It was written by a young friend of my old age, but it has not been circulated, according to her. It is the work before the Mayan Snow Mountain Temple. It is clearly forbidden to be opened up by the favorite cover, because it is too taboo. Anyone who is close to the gods has always been regarded as a true heresy by those who are not dead. Look at the face of tobacco, I will tell you all about it, Nibelon-root heart, the core word is 'bloom', this is the two extremes with the curling of the magic book, little guy, you Didn’t you hide a dark gold plaque? It is the best explanation of 'collapse', compressing the density of both the material and the spirit of the object to the extreme, and 'blooming' is the maximization of dilution. This special dilution does not reduce the original density. Terrible, right? The various elements in alchemy cracked and exploded, follow this rule, oh, it seems that this is not accurate enough, I said that the explanation is not suitable for me, forget it, you just listen, it is probably such a meaning, small Augustine, your nuclear capacity has actually reached a good scale. Once you're 'blooming', you can at least reach the level of most of the gold clover magicians in your empire. Your holy empire is really a dog, the magician and the magic. The gods eat the bad belly and pull it like a pull. It’s a big piece, it’s eye-catching, hey, little guy, don’t look at me with that kind of look, I’m not talking about the purpose of the stool.”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sorrow for the Viscount who lowered the normal IQ because he became a beggar. Is this the sinister king who was madly worshipped in that year? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world has collapsed and the spiritual pillar has collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man suddenly panicked, "Little guy, don't tell you with a Nibelon-root heart?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin bitterly said: "Unfortunately."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My old friend explained that the name was Nibelon-root, Among the many dragons, only the heart of the frosty dragon Niebo is a natural chaotic container. It has the opportunity to create history. It is also the only dragon that will not wither immediately after being slaughtered by human warriors. Only the Mayan temple is preserved. Half of the heart, inlaid in the eye "will" of the magical gods in the statues of the three gods, she seems to have mentioned that only those who have been known as the "Niebolong paradox" of the jewel of the magic crown can Have that half heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man who looked at the old man looked back at the slim drawings and looked at Augustine again. He tentatively asked: "St. Artemis, have you heard of this name?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin flashed a smack of eyes, hesitated and said: "If there is no accident, she is my childhood magic teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time it was the turn of the old Roman Grand Duke's face, a look of sadness, and whispered: "My goddess of crush."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man began to be mad, his eyes were hot Road: "Have you ever held her hand? Have you been lying on a bed? Have you ever had dinner with her? Have you seen her smiling face?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Augustine rolled his eyes and ignored the unreasonable madness of the old man. This is the "bloom" of human nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hemel’s “Little Princess” after the Roman Grand Slam coughed a little, and the old man converges a bit, touches the dry chin, and finally recovers After a few minutes, he was so poor that he was a poor man. He slowly got up. "I should go back. Prince William, who is mourning the grandson who made me go out of the Caucasus, began to feel restless. It seems that he really lost the last. With a little patience, I sent three holy knights and a sword saint to ask me to enter the coffin. Oh, I am not saying who will send his daughter to a female slave to send a dragon. I really don't understand. Humorous old-fashioned man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Rome said he got up, but did not move his feet, his eyes kept licking the residual tobacco on the table. The half-god behind him has closed his eyes. It is really sad to have such an unspoken master. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looked helplessly and ordered Dimit to go to the bookstore owner to come to all the tobacco, to provoke and ridicule the old man of the Titans, holding the box, laughing Flowers, but the words on the mouth are sincere: "Little guy, I am not your enemy, nor your friend. But in the Caucasus, you are always welcome to such an interesting young man."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, who got up together, smiled and said: "Old Rome, do I need to send you away from Alpha City?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man shook his head, Refused this kindness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, Augustine, who is more than a businessman, is not arrogant, saying: "Then you quietly understand the structure of the new species of the Lich King, Shouldn't it be?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Roman skin is one of the oldest guys that Augustine has ever seen. "This is a rush, and I will meet again next time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Roman Grand Duke has never been Too much Augustine was annoyed: "Next time? Do you want to be in the next few decades?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man did not give Augustine the opportunity to cruel his despicable acts, he took a haha, softly Road: "Go, little guy. I am very glad to meet you. If you can teach Princess Barbara to be a slave girl, Old Rome must give you the Ekarin baby dragon as promised."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin reluctantly said: "Besides you, who is willing to go against the Titans who are wearing Odin's big brother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since appearing in Augustine The vision has never been a majestic Roman grandfather laughs, I do not know whether it is a joy to praise, or joy in the hands of good tobacco, habitually hit a ring, in an instant, the second floor of the bookstore emerged more than a dozen fist size "Satan's Inverse" - the gray nest, which hangs to form a similar star Graphics. This group of beautiful but terrible gadgets is the core of the division. The prince of the Lich was a fanatic. Only the sorcerer who stepped into the high threshold knew the horror of these gray nests. When the great von Pierre Charlemagne opened up a lonely path of a single gray nest, he died after the Holy See hunt. There are countless descendants of the descendants who follow his footsteps, admiring the ultimate in a single gray nest, judging the strength of the puppet pull line, but there is a freak in the world to pick up the earliest 傀儡 Bible, which can simultaneously control several even More than a dozen gray nests, this neuropathy is the Roman Grand Duke who was abandoned by the Magic Guild and accidentally chose to be a professional. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man stood in the middle of the gray nest and made a snap. The tall, burly female half-dead, Heimer, went down halfway, pressed one hand on the floor, and then slowly lifted it up, pulling out a holy white light with a high density and an amazingly real form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulse point! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine is amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic teacher Artemis said that only half-god can pass half an epic continent through the pulse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Rome and his noble maid disappeared mysteriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a dozen gray nests that built the mysterious magic array did not disappear immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine immediately took the pen and paper and recorded it. This is the biggest gift from the old man. The ash nest slowly retreated, and Augustine put the drawings together and put them together with the Gabriel silver box. Sitting in the window position, smashing out the gods, he saw many powerful people beyond the imagination in the past few years, the spiritual leader of the imperial white magic, the Teutonic priest; the night watchman known as the war mad Butcher, Earl of Juggernaut; the emergence of one of the Kepler gallows battles, killing a golden subspecies of the Pope's Hall, the second priest, St. Pierre; then a little joke with Augustine in Jupiter City The great man of Hai Ji created the "mother of the black sheep" with countless new black magic. Almost so sublime to St. Jerome, which historians think can't be surpassed by future generations; but just because of the lack of two front teeth, anyone at first glance seems inevitable to have some funny and ridiculous old man, Roman Grand Duke, except his Powerful without doubt, and the only human who personally proved the existence of the pulse, he went too fast, so that Augustine had no time to ask him more information about the childhood magic teacher. But no matter what, whether they are enemies or friends, Augustine thank them, because it is they who let him not dare to despise the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, in a secluded bookstore on the Witch Street, the black tea on the desk is already cold, and the strong tobacco smell is blown away by the breeze. A young monk bowed down to a long-standing playing card, the material is a precious and unparalleled dragon, when the black dragon Dandong, who was away from the lair 120 years ago, fell in the white dynasty dynasty, the apostolic playing card that year. There was only one pair of dragons playing cards. Augustine earned a lot of faith points in the night watchers, but most of them were used to read the heretical books and find confidential information. This, even the priests expressed their confusion. Solution, Augustine finally learned that the playing cards given by the magic teacher in his hand were the "black emperor" of that year, drawing a goddess with a crown in the crown, and the back is a black magic in the top ten in the taboo magical "Forbidden Zone" In the dark sun, there is a beautiful arc of arcs in the dark sun, but Augustine did not find this pattern of apostolic playing cards in the historical materials, but its material is indeed a true dragon, all this can not Reasonable explanation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin slammed up, collected the cards, burned the book with the Nibelon-root heart, and then took the Viscount and Di Mitt left the bookstore, and the boss who was hiding in the corner never dared to go out. Now in Maso County, there is hardly any news about the fourth governor of the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice related to the good words of gentleness, kindness and friendliness. The West Coast Arena and the search for the city of Lancôme Castle, killing the cruelty of the Count of Heber, collecting confession books and swindling the treacherousness of the gold coins, demonstrating the conceit to the Condit family in the Villa, and the bloody hands in the near future. Stretched to Champs, where does the bookstore owner dare to expect such a devil to repay the dozens of Caesar gold coins? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came to the Pope’s antique shop where Mrs. Quentin was, it was as expected for the first time in the antique shop. Mrs. Quentin created a small dark room to place her beloved baby, although there was no Augustine that Augustine had. Grade hot springs and Vulcan saliva are rare and rare, but they are superb quality on the Witch Street, and after inquiry, it is known that Mrs. Quentin is a magical craftsman with no certificate, and those in the antique shop who have two or more levels of praise. The semi-finished crystal rod is the result of her boring pastime, which made Augustine feel a little shocked, but did not show it, just asked for a few bottles of high-quality expensive magic liquid "Athena Flame", used to raise the darkness to be fed Jin Hao, when Augustine was very upstart, poured a whole bottle of green "flame" into Gabriel silver box, the dark yellow cockroach immediately trembled, expanded, contracted, and kept looping. After a few minutes, the whole 傀儡 appeared Full of golden yellow, Mrs. Quentin, who had some distressed feelings, witnessed the wonderful eating of Dark Gold, and her mood was barely better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is very rude: "The ownership of the 'Pope" belongs to me, and the right to operate is Mrs. Fiona. You have no right to buy or sell in addition to the store. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin looked unhappy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled and said: "But you can use the materials of the Chantilly Monopoly store to create magical items that you think are interesting. After you sell, you can get A certain percentage of dividends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin is still weak, looking at the eyes of a house full of sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin couldn’t care for a woman’s resentment, and picked a sigh-level black crystal wand, sighing at the tenth level, lower than the epic level, but It is higher than the singer level. His Titan Longan is the core of the magic circle of God's left eye. He can't leave the cemetery of poetry songs for a long time. For the magician, no one can easily control the magic props that are too much beyond their own strength. Certainty is a crucial point of magic. For example, a sword daisy magician, it is impossible to use an epic or sigh level staff, not easy, and not safe, no one wants a docile one. Magic skills become violent wild horses that cannot be tamed. This type of meaningless casualty is a shame to the magician, so the imperial official expressly stipulates that the level of the magician's props matches the level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, who holds the sigh of blacksmiths, walks out of the antique shop and enters the carriage with the gold balance badge that was first published in the new institutional order of the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
