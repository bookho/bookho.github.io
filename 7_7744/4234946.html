			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Tomorrow for early upload, red ticket detonated "癞蛤蟆"!)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is full of rewards Going back to the Poetry Castle, I was loaded with a full two carriages by Elizabeth, and there were jewels, some of which were taken from the neck and wrist of the Mississippi lady. There are jewels that are buckled from the handle of the knight's sword, and there are famous paintings that are pulled down from the wall. There are shipping satins that are too late to make fashionable gifts, as well as a large number of Caesar vouchers found in the secret room. Bundle a bundle and pile it on the carriage like waste paper. Seeing Augustine stunned and asked: "Are you planning to let the Ascott Manor economy go back ten years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I don't care, your governor who is not sensitive to money is too shabby. As a personal butler, I have an obligation to make the poetry brothers rich, this is the killing of the rich in your mouth." Little Loli sat on a jewelry box and smiled brightly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you estimate how much Caesar gold you have harvested." Augustine is curious, it is impossible to connect the beautiful little princess with the blood-sucking bloodsucker. Together, the Marquis of England, holding the head of the Viscount of Heber, left the manor, and it was tantamount to conveying a clear message, a castle symbolizing the shame of the Lion King. You are now searching for it, and sooner or later you will return to the Todd family. Augustine has been analyzing the source of the lion's self-confidence along the way, and he can't understand it. The Marquis does not fight in the most dominant situation. Is it because he wants to join the Marceau nobles to come to cosmo for a wave of offensive? Wouldn't it be the slap in the face of the emperor of the entire county? Is the political mind of the Marquis of England so mentally retarded? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jewelry and satin, find an honest auction house that can sell 1.8 million to 2.2 million Caesar gold coins, those earned through Mississippi and slave trade The number of Caesar tickets that come is 600,000. I believe this is only a small part. Most of them are taken to the snowball by Hebera’s poor ghosts. The money is rolled out, the profits are rolled, and the nobles of the human aristocrats are best at it.” Ramp, pulling his fingers, suddenly stared at the unexpected Augustin, solemnly proved, "Before you say, except for Caesars, you are my personal belongings, and the oil painting satin is the sacred and inviolable." The wealth, even if you have given me the Garden of Eden, I will not promise to give it to you, never!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine smiled, then couldn't help but frown and frown. "But I have a small problem, butler, why do I declare that I want to keep the portrait murals of the suites properly, but finally every woman's chest and ass are not smeared. Ink, is it a hole?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Loli is surprised, a look of sorrow and sincerity, "Oh, that must be me accidentally I came across the ink bottles, and they are very troublesome to carry them. It is definitely inevitable that they will be bumped and damaged. It’s not surprising.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The helpless Augustin shook his head. Relying on the car window to close the eyes, the driver of the carriage is Mrs. Quentin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is not a conceited fool. When he waits for the Red Lions Knights to ask for sin in the room, he creates a transmission magic that is only mastered by the Mayan temple in this world. Array, because this involves the core of the mainland pulse point field, is an immature dark technology, with the abundant nuclear capacity of Augustine, the transfer of the trophy of Elizabeth and Fiona Louis to the castle of Poetry is quite laborious. Witch Artemis said that only half-god, it is possible to instantly "go down" from the Arctic Bell Cathedral in the northernmost place to the Temple of War in the Titan Empire. In fact, Augustine has no confidence in the Nile River. And the black Mamba king summoned to Lancôme Castle, as to why the adventure, specifically want to get the degree of interest, Elizabeth is too lazy to ask, since occupying the little princess to save almost perfect body and soul, she More and more lazy, peace of mind to be a carefree little housekeeper. Mrs. Quentin did not enter the transmission array and had been hiding in the bedroom of the suite. Augustine did not trust that Sayuri could withstand all the unexpected situations. She was gradually away from the Ascott Manor, and Augustin closed her eyes and said: "Thousand Knights The regiment is really pleasing to the eye, but unfortunately it is someone else's."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Envy gives me money to make money." Elizabeth rolled her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’m already making money, are these confession books in my hands plus those oil paintings, aren’t they all Caesar gold coins?” Augustine’s mouth twitched, 睁Open your eyes and stretch out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought you were going to drag each of them into the ministry." Elizabeth disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The stability of the Marceau County is the stability of the city of Judit. Whoever destroys it is tantamount to the heart of the empire. I don't have that courage now." Augustine Self-deprecating, "But the clever shepherd knows to put a shepherd dog into the flock, otherwise the dead sheep will get sick."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Commend the omnipotent Almighty of Judah the Great and the Patriarch." Elizabeth dismissed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't praise, omnipotent, all gods." Augustine sneered, if the average person said this, I am afraid that he would squat with the one. The child whose absolute power leads to absolute corruption is dragged into the sacrament. It is necessary to know that the guy was originally a heir to the emperor. As a result, he lost his words at the dinner party, and the emperor never saw this wisdom again. The young "thinker". Of course, Augustine does not worry about someone coming to his theoretical doctrine. As long as he has the only legacy of the godfather, "Teaching," as long as "Teaching" is a Vatican's Holy See, he does not have to worry, Augustine thinks of the godfather, a bit Sentimental, take a deep breath, pick up the curtains, have entered the Black Swan Lake, turned to look at Elizabeth, who is busy stroking a string of sapphire necklaces, said: "If we have money, we have to spend it, and then there are several needs in Alpha City. I went to the 'probationary' Mississippi customer, so Miss Elizabeth can go to the Raven or Lolita to buy what you bought last time but not willing to buy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Augustin, I love you, love you as much as I love the Muse." Little Loli flew to Augustine, apparently wanting to take the opportunity to smash the oil, and Augustine, who had been prepared, stretched his ankle to the side, looking sad, but Turned a blind eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poetry castle is finally a little bit of fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the addition of a lot of interest value that can be squeezed by the Louis Butler and Mrs. Fiona, the transmission array of the Poetry Castle is a square on the 8th floor. Centrally, for the first time to enter the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice, Junmei’s youth was desperate and numb, especially when two large and amazing black and white “great dragons” poured into the square and entangled in the transmission array. He finally understood why the lover and the owner were dual. As soon as the Viscount Heber heard "Augustin Rothschild", he scared the big thing he could often "meet". The woman’s nerves are stronger than men’s, and it’s true. Mrs. Fiona is very curious to walk in the underground square. She is careful, and the pair of peach blossoms that have seduce many nobles are very relaxed. I don’t know why, intuition tells her to evaluate The big ruling officer who wrote the confession letter and did not want to deliberately target her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth returns to the poem, and the black Mamba king snake is driven back to the Black Swan Lake. This pet of more than ten meters still wants to be spoiled, and the result is Little Loli was beaten, and Luis and Mrs. Fiona were scared. The black Mamba king sneaked back and forth in three steps. The Nile River was in the Eden upstairs because of the nest, so stay On the 8th floor, swimming in the square, very happy, even with Mrs. Fiona "seeing the same", sticking out her tongue and licking her face, fortunately this "little girl" is not saliva with dissolution function Black Mamba king snake, otherwise Mrs. Fiona is completely disfigured countless times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let's stay away from her, and be careful to become a slut." Finally, Elizabeth, who had lost a lot of private wealth into the No. 1 nest, saw this scene and was angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother White’s eyes are resentful, like the master of the time when Augustine was flying. Mrs. Fiona looked innocent and embarrassed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin didn’t have time to pay attention to the two tragic guests’ fights with Elizabeth. He came to the Horns Lab with three skeleton knights and called the three responsible persons. A conference room dedicated to discussion and rebuttal, the chief research officer, Miss Yi Yi, Professor Shirley, and the latest top-ranking but outstanding assistant Eugene. This is also a small pioneering work of Augustine. The horns hold a weekly exchange of ideas every week. Any strange ideas of the Arabian Nights can be put forward. It is best to come up with a planning book and a rough test plan. The members of the horns negate and criticize. If a plan or a certain idea is not overthrown, then the lucky one will be able to obtain invaluable points of thought. If you get a few points, it will be judged by the Dark Archon Augustin. If there is any result, You can also discuss additional points with the three responsible persons. Because cosmo implements a cruel final elimination system, even a single point means the continuation of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shofar, the number of thought points is the weight of your life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very intuitive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17-level dragon knight, lily, 16th-level knight, 15th-level knight rose, standing behind the "hereic artist" who created them, still look Indifferent Miss Yi, the assistant teacher of Kim, and the Professor Shirley who finally had no charming smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin whispered: "The same great knight, 5% deviation, but created three levels of undead knight, Eugene, Professor Shirley, can give My reason?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim's assistant has no expression and slowly bows his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Shirley frowned and sighed: "I lost this competition, I am willing to accept your punishment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shook his head: "Professor Shirley, punishment must be implemented, but this is not the most important thing. If you don't reflect, the punishment will continue until your hands are all eliminated. You I don't want to see this situation, I don't want it either. Well, I don't want to pursue your dereliction of duty here. All I can do is put the competitions of your three laboratories in a fair and just framework, so from the very beginning Privately complaining that Professor Shirley, whose comprehensive strength is too weak, I decided to give you a young magician whose name is Hall. I hope that you can make good use of his mind. Also, this time the eliminated person will experiment with you. The room was chosen as a punishment for his unfortunate follow with a less intelligent leader. Professor Shirley, do you have any objections? For me, I arranged Hall into the Rose Lab, Miss Yi, Kim Assistant, you Do you have any objections?"<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
