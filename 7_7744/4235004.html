Decided to live a few more days, which made the wife who returned to Alpha City today a headache, and was so entangled by Zusili that she had to stay one more day. When Augustine was sitting in the study room and knew that Uz had left the Black Swan Lake, leaving only a rare armor "leader will" made by the dragon, it was somewhat inexplicable. Ulysse said: "Augustin, let me use the bourbon silver coins in your pocket."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin handed him the silver coin, the one-eyed dragon threw the front, and then surrendered two A copy of the answer sheet, a true full-volume answer, a forgery, is in line with the normal intelligence of Us, Ulysse took back the carefully forged answer, sighed: "Your luck is always good." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looked at the real answer and smiled and said: "My cousin is a very good performer."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse shrugged: "Who said no?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin asked: "If you throw the opposite?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysses said: "Then you can only hope that you are the illegitimate of the goddess of fate. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stretched out his finger and knocked on the table and asked, "I wake up Dimit, can I 'retain' the next one from Constantine?" Cousin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse shook his head and said: "No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looks a little Regrettably, but soon calmly smiled: "I guess he is also a competitor, and the ranking is not low, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is very close to the truth, But Ulysse hardly said: "These things, you need to dig yourself. My main business is to play chess, hobby is to help you repair the poetry song castle. Augustine, for this you have paid for a piece of equipment for me in the Garden of Eden The price of the rosebud, do you still want to pay more?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin laughed and said: "If the price is to give you a rose, I don't mind much. Do a few transactions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulyssey smiled and pointed at the head on his neck and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin reluctantly said: "Only Miss Elisabeth is willing to be your friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; turned and looked at the answer sheet with a slightly different handwriting. One word and one word looked at the past. Augustine’s thumb and index finger rubbed the bourbon silver coin and said to himself: “Constant, Dragon Museum, Dragon Dissector The madman cursed by the dragon, the insulted one of the ten gold families, the dirty blood, the madman. Oh, remember, schizophrenic, Ues cousin, are you the Turing? I am too optimistic I thought that if I made a small feat, I could be seen by Constance and Fermoth. Thank you for coming, this time I sent a leader of the armor, I will see you next time, I will treat you with hospitality. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulse, who has been leaning against the wall of the corridor outside the study, quietly left, came to his rosebuds in the Garden of Eden, and took the knife to be gentle and gentle. Tailored, it’s hard to imagine that this strong one-eyed man has just finished two dangers. Conversation, no one knows why a lonely dragon will love the most colorful and the most fragile of red roses, the impression, that he is more than the devil devil man should love vitality and more glamorous carnivorous grass lantern fishes. At the beginning of the night, the giants of the Teutonic priests, in addition to being strong, seem to have their own distinct flaws. The king of the hills loves Haiji adults, and the leaders of several major branches also have the same The weakness, the only secluded Ulysses, the most silent, except for those who can't answer the answer, are left a part of the body of the joke, the man with the holy spear to stab the right eye has been in the Lucifer lab and the undead The clock tower went back and forth. At this time, he was lying on the wet soil of the flowerbed, closing his left eye, sniffing the fragrance of the rose, holding an unknown folk song, and extending a hand to pat the beat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the afternoon of his wife’s departure from the poem, she specially found Augustine in the study, borrowed tea and tea sets, and cooked a pot of black tea for Augustine. Alcohol is more skillful than Professor Shirley, who pursues the quality of life. This chat is more unscrupulous than the previous two, and directly takes the Holy Empire to open the knife. Augustine is perhaps the reason for the poetry song, not too Many concerns, many arguments are directly thrown out nakedly: "The empire is different from the Gorse dynasty and the Oguja with three governments. Our empire may not be pure in the narrow sense, but it is the only one. The empire that quickly caused the aristocratic group to collectively lose violent habits, only took two generations of time. The big lords used to live in the big cities where the family was entangled. They used to move closer to the emperor and the court. This process is destined to be later history. The family is called the most wonderful power migration."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The power of the sacred empire lies in the external seal, the openness to the inside, the empire in the central and western parts of the epic continent. Once the war is opened, it is often found that there are countless brothers and relatives in the enemy army, such wars, unless It is the time when the country is in a state of survival. Otherwise, it is only an amusement game for the superstructure, or the immature sergeants are tempering in their temper, often not serving the long-term service of the country. The war is easy to become a personal interest. Our openness, Those who have experienced fierce criticism, forced default and quiet approval, most notably military upstarts and merchant honors, these two roads are very rough, which requires two aspects to support, one is that the emperor consciously away from the nobility Open a sufficient distance and finally have a strong voice. This is an imaginary empire that is controlled by one or more gold families. Only the Holy Empire, Titan and Kaly have a chance. Second, the Empire does not. To the core circle of ten people, you can form a high tacit agreement with the emperor, now it seems that The country has been arduously successful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This may be very abstract, then I am looking for a very small cut: the Emperor’s majesty led the aristocratic circle to ceramics. The wave of silverware and tea, these fresh things first became the darling of the court. Next, it was naturally adopted as a fashionable hobby by the ministers and local aristocrats who tried to integrate into the court life. Then, the middle aristocrats were afraid of being laughed at by the big nobility. His own style is not elegant enough. Even if he can't afford the expensive things, he still buys the scalp. As for the small aristocrats and the wealthy families, they will be more depressed. So the two results are born. One is to stimulate the empire to the maritime industry. The development is no longer the emperor's next person to bear the astronomical figures of the gold coins, the second is relatively hidden, part of the bankrupt little aristocrats, began to join the battlefield, relying on medals to support the family's honor, some speculators saw the loan Bringing huge profits, the latter has ripened the seedlings of the banking industry, and the war broke out with the continuation of the holy war and the red Gogol plain The fortunate banking industry has become a big tree independent of the ordinary business world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This directly led many nobles to start the land, this was the ancestors A distressed child is only a happy accessory to other more important incomes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The Emperor’s Majesty moved the great nobles into the city but encouraged them to build in the suburbs. Country houses, even the suburbs that don’t mind the nobility are more brilliant than the royal palace, but under the circumstance, every house needs to lay roads, cut waterways, build fountains and ensuing countless numbers for magicians and architects to earn. Take the extra-complex machine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other emperors and kings ascended the throne, all need to be worshipped by the Pope or the Archbishop of Red, from the senior priest The crown has been taken in his hand, adding brilliance to the sacredness of the monarchy. Does the Holy Empire need it? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okuja, what is the future of an empire that is mobilized in 18 languages? The gorse, a lord of the Olympian red daring dare to dismiss the dynasty advocated by the emperor, is really as powerful as we think. Titan, the eleven-year-old red Gogol war does not cross the son of this strong war, then once every five years? Once every three years? The one who quietly put "The Wealth of Nations" on the desk of the last emperor, Is he the hero of the empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The young emperor of the sacred empire defined the exploration council of the largest dragon vein St. Megan and the affiliation of the Senate Islands They all showed superhuman vision, but no one thought that he was a great strategist. Even the old emperor of Bai Weiwei also ridiculed the phrase 'a housewife who only accounts for the immediate interests'. The result is very clear. White Rose is regulated. Therefore, silence does not mean incompetence. All beautiful scenery will only appear in the vision of the person standing at the highest point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" The sacred empire is not falling The sun is still a shining meteor. The answer is only in the hands of Jupiter the Great, but I think it is the former."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon, Augustine calms The tone said a lot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady who went to the Ministry of the Holy See but made tea to the Grand Executive instead of drinking tea was the first listener. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lady left, there was a lot of trouble, Augustine sent to the edge of the Black Swan Lake. The lady sat in the carriage of Fermoth and drove far away. Through the dust, she saw that he was always at the origin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zusili joked: "Madam, you have picked up the curtains for the fourth time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The lady did not show shyness, just touched: "Maybe I should not come to the poem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zusley is shaking her lady's arm, Spoiled: "Mrs, I have never revealed your secret from the Rudolf family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady smiled and said: "I believe that the string of black pearl necklaces has been given His best clue, this is my own negligence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Zusili naively said: "The necklace is not taken when leaving Alpha City. Got it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady sighed: "For some people, you may only need to look at a riddle to solve a series of mysteries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not a smart ancestor Miss Sili asked tentatively: "Madam, are you praising my mediocrity to a relative who can't be more ordinary?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mediocrity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the distance, Augustine finally turned around and sneered at the corner of his mouth: "Goodbye, conquered the woman of the Imperial Wolf King, Mrs. Ekaterina. I hope you can be in the emperor. I explained some lies that I would never be convinced when I said it myself."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin took the marble path under Quebec Sugar Maple and went to the Gemini statue. Sis stayed here, this is the cousin's subconscious behavior? Still a hint of "full of family"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is Byzantine or Vatican, the two Holy Sees have always followed unspeakable and unspeakable words for any miracle and holy fall. The principle of unpredictable, the ancient literature that has been recorded and preserved, is the private behavior of some atheists. These kinds of confidential files are sealed in the most secretive places, especially those that have been proved to bring disaster to the mainland. The holy drop, its recorded text, even a thin sheepskin roll, will be sealed on a layer-by-layer basis. Each time it opens regardless of the destination, it has to go through numerous approvals, such as the first song of poetry. Sheng Sheng, even if the chief research officer Miss Yi Yi was strictly loyal to the mother of the Black Sheep at that time, she explained to Augustine that she did not disclose anything to Hai Ji adults, but explained the luckyness of the poetry song with a series of extremely vague words. In fact, the Holy Spirit and the Ewe have not known the details of St. Urban today* until St. Urban turned back to the hell of Tartalos, and Augustine told the Emperor that there was a middle-level angel who was magically divorced by God. Summoned out, and it finally left the poetry song and returned to heaven. As for why it appeared in the ancestral ritual temple of the wild land, Augustine simply used the word "unknown" and believed that Zhu Di, who has been the largest atheist of the empire for many years, believes The great emperor will not give too much curiosity to this. When the truth comes to the surface, it is almost the “ten years” that Augustine presupposes. At that time, there is no need to weave more lies for this lie. The biggest question now is, even if Jupiter can wait patiently until that day, can Augustine's life hourglass stick to that day? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal life expectancy of human beings is fifty years. The nobles could have increased their precious twenty years because of their excellent living conditions, but the greed for meat and the vegetables. Abandonment, excessive overdraft on the bed, and many other privilege that have adverse effects, so that the nobility only lived ten years longer than the civilians, the knight, unless it is a sacred knight, the trauma of war makes this group and the length of life of the general aristocracy no different, the only The exception is the magician. Except for the purely theoretical magicians who “theoretically act as a gnome in the giants”, most of the magicians are able to get the favor and care of the goddess of life because of their physical training and the theory of shackles. It often means that the young age of the first time into the magical hall and even the childhood era began to adhere to the rules of restraint and restraint. The magician is the vulgar endorsement? This is definitely the evil scorpion of the knights. Just think about it with your buttocks and knees. There is not enough healthy body, how to think about the headaches, how to persist in the long-term shackles, the annual assessment of the magic guild, every year. There are special spells that take more than fifteen minutes, which makes the physical fitness of many intermediate magicians generally comparable to or even beyond the lazy low-ranking knights, the preferred knight profession, often habitually extreme rejection of the magician, but the preferred magician occupation However, it is very interesting to like the minors, but even if a magician reaches the level of a great knight, he often does not receive a medal. Augustine is a different kind of alien. According to common sense, living to 60 years is definitely not a problem. It is hard to say now. As long as there is any war that requires a hole, Augustine can be sure that he will not live for the next decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine suddenly wanted to accompany Pandora to the star of the astrological hall Dracula to see the starry sky. Usually, he could accompany Lori butler to the crow market to buy some luxury items that ladies would like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some tired Augustine returned to the study, squatting on the desk and falling asleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the confusion was completely blurred, there was no reason to remember a childhood conversation:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, Do you like to travel?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world is a book, you don't travel, just open a page."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's like traveling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, who was still a child, ate a strong chestnut, she said softly: "No People know that this book is a comedy or a tragedy. It doesn't open the next page. There is no absolute good or bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin squinting at his head, looking up The private magic teacher wearing a black robe all year round, asked pitifully: "Which page is that teacher? Is it a tragedy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine feels that there may be no chance to get a real answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asleep in the past, frowning, still can not be like a carefree baby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hinterland of the Muse, half a year ago, experienced sobbing in two wars Plain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A black robe appeared on the plain, draped in a cloak with a dark magical pattern, a few black hair hanging down, blending with the black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She just stood in Augustine and grabbed a spot of khaki gravel, squatting down, like him, still slipping from the fingers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After less than a piece of gravel fell to the ground, the whole earth began to violently tumbling like boiling water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
