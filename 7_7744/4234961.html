			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Glory of the aster flower.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majestic fennel vista is like a sleepy The dragon has a military fortress like the White Elephant Castle on the torso, and a forest villa like the Bliss Bird. The former belongs to the Barbarian Greenspan, the empire upstart with hands and blood, and the latter is the industry of the old aristocratic Condid family. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The luxury carriages on the wide road at the foot of the fensberg mountain range are endless, half of which are the middle families of the Meso County province looking up to the Condi family, and half of them are the emperors Conde’s partner, Condit’s partner, is a term that needs to be written into the Imperial Encyclopedia to explain it separately, to prove that the Condit family has a wide network of contacts, and Conduit has never been At the top of the imperial power pyramid, there was no empire prime minister, not even a general or secretary of state. It only produced the chief tax collector and the county chief executive. It is possible to add an empire or even a new plaque that is about to spread throughout the continent. Occupation - the colonial governor, so Conti has never left the core of the empire. In Maso County, Condit is the shadow chief. The dispute between the local families is not to go to the county administrative department. Instead, he finds the old owner of the Condid family and sits down to have a drink at the top of the Conti private winery. White wine, contradictions can often be easily resolved in a sunny afternoon tea time. It is rare that Conti, who is a native of the Marceau County, is not annoying. The heads of the previous counties and provinces have maintained good relations with Conti. This may be the survival wisdom of an ancient family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foot of the fennel mountain, a wide road leading to the group of bliss birds, the continuous carriage of horses on the road, without exception, carved a family badge, Ma More than aristocratic families in the county of Somalia have arrived. Unfortunately, the Todd family who did not see the red lion flag, Maso County only vaguely knew that a young sacramental giant who lost the nobility title went to the Ascott Manor and collected a lot of confession books at the Mississippi Arena, but then Silently and silently, the audience of the arena who had been forced to write down the confession book in the first place had a sigh of relief and came to the conclusion that the elegant villain who was not like a priest nor a knight was afraid to go to the whole small Marceau County. Provocative, even more afraid to compete with the righteous Lion King, several private estates near the Black Swan Lake can clearly remember the shocking scene of the roaring of the Red Lions and thousands of Knights, more people even speculate the little poetry brother Castle Has it been crushed by the iron hoof of the lions? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage of the Blue Griffin badge in the Mian Chang team is particularly eye-catching, and the road is large enough to accommodate two side-by-side carriages. This is true of many well-connected families. This carriage, which was followed by a large number of squatters from the Cavaliers, seemed to be alone and conceited, not to mention side by side. There were no carriages within a hundred feet of the front and rear. This is the arrogance of the Marceau County alone in Greenspan. The carriage is huge and spacious. It is towed by a Hazel horse and three fennel horses. The horse farm under the fennel mountain is rich in imperial horses. Although it is not the tallest horse, it has excellent endurance. In a knight war, the resilience of a horse is as important as its explosiveness. As for the Haize pure blood horse-drawn carriage, I am afraid that only the upstart barbarians can do things. To know this well-deserved horse queen, the Jupiter City aristocrats still need to wait for several years to take care of them home. Many gorse dynasties like the arty first-line aristocrats who are proud of owning a Hai Ze pure blood horse, and only want to sleep in the stables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the carriage, there is a monk dressed in a robe, a lady dressed in a gorgeous and unique style, and a maid who is better than the hostess. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our empire's 'Gospel' and Kami's exploration fleet have discovered two new continents at the same time, this is the most sensational news on this epic continent, Jinque The Flower Dynasty and the Titan Empire demanded that the summit be held for the first time to discuss related issues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-informed socialite whispered, "Undoubtedly a replica of the island of Qincha, The same is a group of people lying in bed to enjoy the cake to a poor trekdy, the only difference is that the last defined Qincha Islands because of the weakness of the founder Jones Principality, plus the Qincha Islands is only a small mining island The forces did not turn their faces on the negotiating table. This time, the empire 'Gospel' led by Napoleon's priest found a region that was comparable to the New World in the eastern part of the empire, and the card was almost at the same time. The island chain on the west side of the New World is named the British Island chain. The three great powers led by the Gorse and the White Rose and the Titan Empire are the first to present information to our empire and Kamen Enjoy, but Queen Catherine directly issued a statement that Britain belongs to the card, and our emperor’s Majesty remains consistently silent. Now even our mortal enemy, the Titan Empire sent a mission to Jupiter, which makes the southern border of the empire The dozens of Knights are at a loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Funny." The priest whispered, then sighed, "The politicians moved their mouths, on horseback The generals will have a headache."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Augustine, are you not a good politician?" The devil's maid smiled and filled with tone. Taunted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful lady who is the most touching pearl of the barbarian quietly sighed, but fortunately, Aunt Quentin still looks like a little spiky gorse in the elegant The descendants of the aristocracy did not change their style because of a humiliating way. The castle of Baixiang, there are still dozens of craftsmen who have repaired the map of the mainland under the auspices of the old butler Asa. The nobility marveled at the ground of the most magnificent hall of the empire in the race of the two men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the barbarian, Miss Alice’s father, Douglas-Greenspan heard that his gift to Little Alice’s tenth birthday was almost destroyed. Furious, almost to lead the ranks of the Knights of the Lionheart to go to the poetry brother, and finally, the barbarian princess gently spoiled a "tolerant warrior father, do you forget, just discovered the New World and the British Isles Chain, and I am about 20 years old, you just sent me a brand new map, this must be the Father's will." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard to imagine that the savage barbarian leader is the most devout believer. He insists on praying. Religious Day never attends a banquet. He is only loyal to a wife for life. He has never heard the affair of lovers and illegitimate children. There are very few nobles, only the Prince Odys of Oggs Song City, the Duke of Poetry's poet, but the Prince's head was hung up with the statue of St. John's Cathedral, and the Duke eventually walked to the square. The gallows, in the sight of tens of thousands of people in the emperor, went to death quietly, even without the smashing "Flower is not dead", unlike the temperamental Prince Odys, the unpopular Prince His Royal Highness was sent to the torture hall, and even cut Under the head, the empire's upper class does not deplore, but when the poet's duke goes to the gallows, the emperor has countless celebrities, artists, sculptors and ladies of the "moderate aristocrats", who are crying in front of their fiancé or husband. Red eyes, and men have moderately shown enough metrics. After all, except for the ancient enemy of Rotongschild, no nobles are unwilling to learn. Duke laughing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a small area, there is even a rumor that the Chief Secretary of State, Gosher, has pleaded with the emperor to plead with the emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The New World has not yet been named?" Augustine frowned. He didn't care about Mrs. Quentin's irony. Maybe in private, he only needed one. The saints believe in the quality of the kittens, but outside the poetry brothers, the order requires a well-prepared diplomat. In a short time, only Mrs. Quentin can play this role. Mrs. Fiona, the pet of the salon, actually has more means and eyesight. Unfortunately, her reputation is really bad. Augustine still hopes that poetry and order can have a relatively normal reputation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not yet, tentatively named "Saints" and "Gospels", but the Holy See is very hot, but the Emperor has always refused to express his position. Silk is soft, today she is sure that Augustine is willing to attend the banquet with her, let the personal butler old Asa bring the most loved evening dress from another castle, exquisite but not luxurious, stand with him, do not use Worried about the embarrassing picture that appears to be incomprehensible because of the disparity between the rich and the poor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the wisdom of the Emperor's Majesty." Augustine explained, "He is a politician with good patience and perseverance. So before the dust settles He will continue to be silent. Every silent day, the empire wins a little more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the so-called dust settled?" Mrs. Quentin looks like I started to get used to being an inquirer, but I didn’t realize it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, the epic mainland collectively posed to the spear of the card, mainly because of the moral level, because of the authority of the Olympian court, but no one is willing to provoke a bloody country with a bloody battle with the wild continent for nearly a thousand years. This time, the Holy Empire and the British Isles chain that she explored are almost a small epic continent. No one wants to fall behind this feast, and it is impossible for the card to appear on the distant virgin land. Without the most embarrassing iron ride on the epic continent, the Camry Empire is like a tiger that has lost its teeth. It is not enough to make the kings pay tribute. Our Emperor’s Majesty is waiting for the stubborn North Wolf to absorb all the firepower. The end of the underground war between the Olympian and the Vatican, and the end of the ten-person round table where he was always absent, waited for the low-key 'gospel', or the imperial darling Napoleon priest to stand firm on the New World." Augustine calmly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Imperial is not a symbolic establishment of a prison between the mainland and the British Isles chain, the empire official said to be used to detain traitors, blasphemy, etc. The sinners who are not forgiven, and today's banquet, the Condit family celebrates their heirs, the Roman Earl received the title of colonial governor jointly awarded by the Empire and the Holy See. "Alice who is proficient in Paia war chess is obviously not a competent person. Politician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a necessary means. The sacred empire remains silent. It does not mean that it can be arbitrarily exploited like the weak Principality of Jones. This is the most vivid attitude of the Emperor. But radical, but at the same time guarantee a moderate toughness. Jones's situation shows that the weak country has no diplomacy, and the diplomats of the Holy Empire prove that the stronger the powerful country, the more flexible the policy is needed." Augustine laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s the Secretary of State’s Secretary of State’s personal handling of this matter.” Alice whispered, glanced at Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No wonder the Academic Court has only sent a small-scale trial team to visit Black Swan Lake. It seems that I am still a small person who is not valued by the Chief Secretary of State. "Augustin muttered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, even Mrs. Quentin closed her mouth and dared not express her arguments easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Rothschild wrote a book "The Flowers Are Not Dead." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first person in the largest institution of the Faculty of Vatican, the former royal literature teacher, the Queen of the song, has a cover of "every flower Everyone will die, every veteran will grow old." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine, who has a great relationship with the two authors, has only one "teaching" to carry around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no outsider guessing that "flowers are not dead." No one even listened to Master Augustine’s complete reading of this little poem, and Elizabeth’s little shaman did not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say this is because Rothschild’s heirs have lost the poet’s temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that this poor and weak monk chose to loyal to the empire in exchange for the life of the traitor’s descendants who should have died. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hometown of Rothschild, Augsburg, when the young Augustine was a child, he rumored to spread his rumors that the maid played with the nun, in his veins At the stage of the practice of the Deola Theological Seminary, he tirelessly told the noble story of the aristocratic teenager in the Meita Corridor. After the darkness of Rothschild, he spared no effort to rebuke Augustine's coward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a clown young man, such a boring grey story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the works of the bard, will you be ridiculed by the lady as a third-rate story written by a second-rate poet? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that everyone has forgotten the little poem filled with dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you talking about? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flowers are not dead":<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a flower, refuse to wither<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind, heavy rain, heavy snow, barren soil<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one appreciates, I will bloom<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a veteran, refuse to leave the battlefield<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rifle is broken, the armor is broken, riding the hummer<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to hold on to my chest<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring ask me<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
