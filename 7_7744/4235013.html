			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent and farthest journey of the young king of Poetry Castle, the shadow prime minister inadvertently made something that shocked Augustine’s heart. In the name of Shishi, the one-eyed dragon has thrown out ten major problems in the whole continent, involving religious philosophies, magical alchemy, mathematics, astronomy, navigation and natural elements, and promised to solve the problem. The 100,000-empire Caesar gold coin, the amount of the redemption voucher is only lower than the black Emperor Saxon's "Dead Sea Paper" co-author, once again become the limelight of the eye-catching characters, ten conjectures and public opinion, three million Caesar's exaggerated promise, Immediately won the tide of speculation, praise and praise for the gold balance badge. In the first year, no scholar went to the Black Swan Lake in the county of Maso County to receive a huge bounty, but when a poorly fallen white astronomer came to the answer with an answer The poem brother, who became the master of the first 300,000 Caesar, immediately caused a huge repercussions. In the second year, the remaining nine Ulisse lost to the world for their own bad taste. Most of them were cracked, and the poetry brother paid all the income of the arena, the legal orange dividend and the profit of the witchcraft street. In the end, only three problems were all taken by the same person, giving a perfect argument. The process, the game ended smoothly, and the squandered Ulysse was already shy, and the final bonus even needed to borrow from the owner of the French orange, the Earl of Marseille, the chief executive of the province of Richelieu, but the one was The lady who is known as the most intelligent mathematician in the world is very vocal and refuses to pay 900,000 gold coins. Then, these eight may be the best-minded people in this era, plus six or seven of them who are eager to gold. Not a young scholar, outside the monastery library where the lady is located, a rainy evening in the dusk, dressed as a librarian at the Verdun monastery, dressed in formal gowns, sketched a collective oil painting, Most of them look old-fashioned, younger, some shy and cautious, even Ulysses was pulled in by the lady, but the tall and poetic poetry In the corner of the back row, with the average person opened for some distance obviously, this is from an unknown corner of the abbot personally dug where the artist dared to speak out in protest. The woman is in the middle and is the only scholar with a bright smile. Perhaps the painter is too cautious and careful. I can see the two naughty little fangs of this handsome lady, very charming scenery. To this end, the arrogant Zhang Li, who made the poetry brother almost become a debt, was ready to be scolded by the young governor, but unexpectedly, when the liar returned "far traveled", he saw this. It means that the paintings of two million Caesars have always been very savvy. The young giants are not angry, but they are in a good mood. They hold several manuscripts that Ulyssey thinks are the most valuable, and bow down to make Ulysses feel inexplicable. The words: "Maybe a few hundred years later, there will be countless students who want to blow up our poetry castle. Fortunately, I am not in the picture, haha, Ulysse, you will be unlucky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the orderly and serious trip to Juan County, Ulysses did not support no objection, did not personally send off, but came to the observatory of the White Elephant Castle, watching the team slowly leave, the bones in the hall of the undead were taken Walking, leaving only the knights of the Kraft family, because those scholars settled in the luxury castle with the approval of Augustin, he showed more enthusiasm and sincerity than Ulisse for those lucky people who have just won huge fortune. Not only has the language affirmed the extravagance and waste of Ulysses, but it also clearly tells Ulysser that he is "inducing". As long as there is a Caesar in the poetry brother castle, he will never only draw a waveside, and the one-eyed man stands in the open field. The observatory has a complicated mood. If he said that he played the role of a bystander for more than two years, he helped to manage the underground kingdom. At this moment, he had the idea of ​​being willing to be dragged into the order chariot for the first time. Even the empire was recognized. The most cherished old man, the Teutonic priest, did not allow a king to be monopolized by the truth, but the younger Augustine was acquiesced by actual action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysse received an apprentice, a young man who came from the Caucasus to earn living expenses, Hesper, as long as the surname does not need Mentioned that he was originally a small assistant of a magician. He finally studied some of the results and was taken away by the teacher. On the magic road, ordinary apprentices met a good tutor, and the probability was the same as seeing the gods with their own eyes. Large, qualified instructors need to have a wealth of knowledge, good morals, not to be swayed by the secular world, and the lack of any of the three will lead students to astray, and Hesper, who is of civilian origin, has encountered a character and A leader who is as bad as learning. Ulysee’s evaluation of this little guy is a low-energy child whose IQ and emotional intelligence are inversely proportional. It is not easy to survive. The Caucasus is a place where money is supreme. The god of the gods, the Roman god, said vulgarly, “The rich people here put a It’s an acceptable fact for the businessman, after all, everything is fair and fair, but for the magic apprentice, it’s a catastrophe, magic material, book scroll , the laboratory, countless pen expenditures, the individual items are not heavy, but they have to be overwhelmed. Hesper has to sell his ass to his mentor in order to climb the knowledge ladder, just to get some essential Free props, tired like a dog, live like a pig, can't stand the squeezing of the mentor, bring freshly baked research results to the sacred empire Marceau County, accidentally became the only apprentice of Ulysses, against He For Spiel, the key to being able to eat and wear warmth is that you don’t have to give up your ass. That’s enough. At this time, he handed the new tutor a cup of black tea. For Ulysses, the young apprentice is extremely awesome. The author of "The Dead Sea Instrument", the second leader of the Fourth Ministry of the Holy Sepulchre, the leader of the top ten problems, is beyond the heights of his Caucasian perverted mentor. To be honest, even if he really wants to give his ass, he also I recognized that I didn't even care about some Caucasian folk songs when I washed my butt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guide, where is the Grand Archeurgist?" Hesper asked a question that had no political sense of smell. It was obviously an idiot who had never been educated by the nobility. In exchange for the Earl of Marseille, he must definitely reward this guy with a whip. A servant, dare to ask this sensitive taboo? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Night Watchman’s Headquarters, where I was driven out." But Ulisse is obviously a mentor with an abnormal mindset, drinking modulation and apprenticeships. Black tea, which is as low-level as common sense, has a dull look and is not angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that there is an angel garden there? You mentioned in the Dead Sea Instrument that there is a large-scale fall of the Olympian angel, just like your prediction The goddess war warfare group withered in the Great Wilson Principality?" Apprentice whisper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-eyed man with a single ponytail nodded. "It is said that the Maya Snow Mountain Temple has the ultimate magical array of the personal wisdom set of the masters of the immortal king." For a thousand years, it sounds very grand, but the night watcher has an old man who said that the magical array is aggressive, and the angel garden is second only to the Golden Island. Your poetry brother, God’s left eye is 'defense and Guardian', Scarlett's soul elegy belongs to the magical '篡 position and aggression', regardless of scale or strength, it is inferior to the former three, but this is not important, the next generation, with the white elephant castle as the new core, There will be a new masterpiece, with Augustin’s madness and timidity, which will not disappoint me. Hesper, you have a good name, in the Dead Sea Instrument your name means 'the swaying tail of the comet ', is the master of the night, I hope that you can stand up to this name and my work, this is the only reason you become my apprentice, not your ass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Young man's face is red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse calmly said: "You can worship the simple but wise Miss Russell, but don't try to get close to her, whether it is physical or soul level, she is Augustine Very concerned about the characters, although I don’t know what Augustine is still thinking about her mind, but basically, what he wants to possess, can’t be occupied by others. This is probably because he has too few things. For the sake of sake, I don't want an apprentice who can sacrifice at any time to break my long run. These words, you have forgotten after hearing it, in poetry brother, who is qualified to play chess, only me, now, and later. If You want to contribute loyalty to Augustine in exchange for ideas. I advise you to give up this innocent romance. He never cares about this kind of thing. This is the first official advice given to you by the mentor. I am really a generous mentor." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweaty Hespel timidly said: "I am only loyal to you, even if you have the same loyalty as the Grand Archon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse hoarse The screaming smile: "The loyalty hanging on the lips is more untrustworthy than the prostitute saying to the customer that you are so powerful, your stuff is really big. This is the second advice. This theory is Augustine taught me, very innovative."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hespelmer silently, the palms are all cold sweat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse sat in a chair and looked at the rolling hills and gently said: "It’s a spectacular scene."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom of the confessional church, the prison of Hell than Hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the fourth dark giant Augustine, the younger but more high-ranking child, y-Meinin stood outside the cage, he? Still she? Or it was the first two years that it had collected a king of the hills and used to use the arm of the Great Sword. Now it has consumed patience to collect the second arm, Juggernaut Wilde, who was once arrogant and dare to openly talk at the giant meeting. The savage man who wants to exchange all the belief points with the one-night stand of Haiji adults has lost two arms. This bloody new collection is held in the child’s hand, and the same person is cut off by the sword arm. It is the swordsman of Oscar Wilde, one of the many cards left by the old man to the night watchman. In addition to the freak of Menuhin and the old Juggernaut who is the servant, this time there is an Eden Gaia, she has been calm and indifferent, y - Menuhin glanced at the woman who had been so calm for the past two years. Last year she even went to the Hughes and Hughes family. Prince Kuiyin went to the Judaima parliament and sucked a long-lived duke and The blood of the two Marquis, which made the family on the table closely connected with the Holy Spirit Hall and secretly inclined to order, and the deputy speaker who left Judah went straight to the Angel Garden. The old man in the long-lived species fought a battle with her. The old priest who had rumored that he hadn’t been killed for hundreds of years couldn’t help but leave a phrase “the evil spirit and the devil’s cross-puppet hybrid”, the ruin of a large number of angel statues. In the battle, the woman in this ministry who is second only to the mother of the Black Sheep does not seem to suffer from too many surface scars, but Menuhin knows that the St. Gall water in her body has begun to burst completely. It’s really a "The bad news that makes people happy," holding Wilde's broken arm in one hand and leaving the woman's hand in one hand, y-Meinin smiled: "Teacher, your patience is much better than me."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eden Gaia gently wiped out the slight yellow blood from the corners of the mouth, no sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child sighed: "Teacher, it seems that I can't wait for him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They went to the angel garden, and Eden Gaia looked grey and dark The sky is still silent. When Meinuin came to the statue of a goddess of broken arm art, he squatted down and borrowed a sword from the old swordsman. He squandered a pit in his own hands, buried the ear of the Wilde, and slowly filled it in. The Angel Garden has been The enemies were smashed into a place where a lot of good people were buried under the thick rose bushes. It was only after the Teutonic priest took over the vigil, and it seemed that after the child took over, the fine tradition was better, Menuhin Stretching one foot and stepping on the dirt, stepping on the small pit and sturdy, looking up and smiling: "Teacher, is it appropriate to bury the broken arm here? Wilde said he wants to comfort me with a big hungry axe. I thought about it. In another two years, I will cut off his big axe and bury it under the statue of an angel who loves pleasure. I think I have the potential of a poet. You Say, teacher?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child’s voice is very careless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eden Gaia frowned: "Walder's followers will choose to betray the vigil. Their patience and tolerance are limited."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y-Meinin handed the sword back to the sorrowful old Juggernaut, clapping his hands and casually saying: "Then they really chose the wrong owner."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eden Gaia took a deep breath. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child "cares": "Teacher, don't be angry, now you are already very fragile. If you take off your clothes, except for your limbs and head, body Already all the pathological golden yellow, this is a precursor to the collapse of the holy angel soul in mythology. Hey, if you forcibly left the angel garden two years ago, I am not willing to leave you, but I have to pay a small price. It’s much easier now, it’s good to have a teacher around.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child said to himself: “Teacher, if you ask me, or put that one The little white cat gave it to me, may you help me to repair the Gothic water cup?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still the child’s self-talk: "You taught me that women have more nerves than men, and the equivalent area is twice that of men. This is why twelve of the thirteen successful trials in Lucifer Laboratories are females. The pain is twice that of a man, and it is more durable. The teacher is even more amazing. The blood of long-lived species and dark species boils in the Gothic glass, burning your internal organs and souls, but it has been for nearly fifteen years. This is a miracle. It is too bad to use the word miracle. Respect your contribution! I am sad when I look at your departure. Teacher, where do you want to be buried by me? Which statue is below?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;For the teacher's non-response, Menuhin is not angry at all. It is the teacher who taught her patience and madness with countless facts. For those who are more memorable and memorable than their loved ones, the child feels that even if he is impatient, he should be more patient. One point, the child sighed again and looked up at her innocent perfect face. "Would you like to bury you in the slums of Augsburg? I am willing to open up a loneliness for me except for no one." Graveyard. I heard that you saw him for the first time, although the man did not see you last, but I think he is more or less attached to your piece because you are so powerful. As for Your brother, I can help you keep that amazing secret, but after the teacher dies, the kitten will return to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eden Gaia calmed down The black cat on the shoulders finally said, "Minin, know why I can go today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menin squinted his head: I want to know, because I am very curious teacher. What is faith?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gently said: "When you fall in love with someone, you will understand."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayin seems to have heard a cold joke that is not easy to understand, always staring in a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More strange and strange words! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayin suddenly bent down and held his stomach, nervously laughing, "parents, relatives, family, night watchers, the whole world loves me so much, I have to I was moved to tears."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing tears, I finally stopped, the child slammed coldly: "If he really comes, I will take him. I am buried with you! But is this possible? For you, he is willing to declare war to the night watcher?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half a month. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An undead army arrived at the headquarters of the night watchers at the junction of the two counties and went straight into the Angel Garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lich King of Naples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dead Sea Knight Descartes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
