			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poetry song's arena opened on the first day, there are not many customers who dare to take risks, which makes the Earl of Marseille, which is the cradle of gold coins, somewhat lost. Augustine, who had a low expectation, was relatively calm and patient, and comforted the Alpha Lord to wait for a while. At that time, the friends who had been beaten by the Piaget to participate in the fight had already left, and Augustine and the fat owner walked to the arena center. The body of a Tauren chief on the ground has just been towed away, even if it is killed, the audience who are greeted by the Muse are still made into specimens, and then take the French orange auction for a good price, Augustine is in the bloody battle. On the field land, grab a handful of soil and whisper: "Marseille, the sticky soil can grow the fruit, rest assured, the Caesar gold coins of Maso County will flow here, I will assure you as a partner. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bloated and obscure Earl of Marseille wanted to follow the big sergeant, but because of his size, he gave up the challenge and did his best. Bent over and smiled: "Augustin, I believe you, really, not only because you are in order. Marseille is not a fool, here is the only choice for the rich people of Maso County, even if there is no exciting activities, they will come in, Moreover, there is also a richer program than the Mississippi Arena. It is me, the first time out of caution, the second time hesitated, the third time, I am sure I am willing to come to Black Swan Lake to have fun. So, what more is more than a guest who has become a poetry song? Is it a character on the invitation list of the Condit family? It is out of date!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustin stood up and clap his hands and said a very jumping word: "The stakes in the Grizzlies are getting smaller and smaller."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Marseille trembles After a chin full of fat, he smiled sullenly: "After Count Dürer went to see God, our Marco nobles could worry that they were the next Dürer."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin patted the wide shoulders of Alpha Lord, reminding "The Archbishop of Ram, oh, is already a bishop. It is a good mix in Jupiter, but there are too many eyes on him. His senior priest is doubting Ram's 'poor' and wants to be red. The Archbishop is more recent and needs a lot of 'children' in your eyes. At this time, if you can show a little generosity, it is far more important than usual to reflect your concern for friendship, with a future superintendent or even red. The Archbishop is a friend. The short-term expenditure is wise and necessary. Marseille, I am a friend with Ram, and you are a friend, but this does not mean that you and Ram are already friends. This requires you. To prove."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl of Marseille thought carefully and nodded: "I understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin squinted at the count’s shoulder, and the luxurious clothes were stained with dust and smiled: "Sorry, Stained your clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl laughed and said: "This is Marseille's honor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustin hesitated and asked: "Marseille, do you want to be a county governor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpha City main eyes: "Of course ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled: "The current Chief Executive of Maso County has made a lot of friendships in the Jupiter City. This is not realistic. But if it is the province of Richelieu, I can help."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat is immediately stiff, Richelieu Province? The richest man in that county is not as good as the poor place of the middle aristocracy. It is said that every time the county governor there attends the meeting of the Imperial Governors is a sad drama. He is not regarded as a friend by the bureaucrats of the same position. Even the small officials with low salary in the financial institutions dare to give their eyes. The Earl of Marseille does not want to be like this. The empire's jokes, especially for his lord who used Caesar as a parent and Bourbon as a relative, went to the poor soils of the county to fight poverty. It was suicide. Augustine didn't have to look at the snobbish fat man's expression, he knew how reluctant he was, just sighed softly: "To become an imperial finance minister who is not criticized, there must be a qualification to become a county governor on his resume. It is the foresight of the future imperial financial steward. There is also a secret that you don’t know. There are large-scale ore underground in Marseille and Richelieu provinces, but mining is more difficult. This is only on several confidential files of the night watchman. Appeared, even the empire did not know. There is a certain risk, most of the administrators who went there to go to work are not wealthy, can not personally take the lead to dig the black gold treasures, but also can not convince the bankers to take risks, but if it is you, Difficulties are not difficult, things will be much simpler. Once the first mine is successfully mined, there will be countless followers rushing into Richelieu, holding Caesar to ask you to sign the mining agreement. At that time, your evaluation is not only An excellent aristocrat who is willing to go to the most backward county in the empire to provoke a heavy burden, and is the first chief executive to bring wealth to the province of Richelieu. Soon, the whole The country will start to pay attention to you. I am afraid that even the emperor will remember your name. At that time, there will be a referral letter on his desk. The signature is certainly not me, but a certain part of the Bourbon or Kraft family. Big nobility."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl of Marseille began to narrow his eyes and really considered the feasibility of this adventure. Augustine still did not look at his face, knowing that the fat eyes of the fat man were completely invisible at this time. This little action means that the smart Alpha owner has been tempted. The truth of Augustin’s deliberate omission is that there are indeed some precious reports about the rich minerals in the province of Richelieu, but the mining difficulty is beyond the age of at least half a century, where the geological complex surface is extremely vulnerable. The most common open field mining and filling mining are not allowed by reality. Because of this, even Jupiter has ridiculed himself that "at least, my grandson will be a richer emperor than me", so the Earl of Marseille is not lucky. It’s good to find one or two lucky ones who are very close to the ground, or can stay patiently in the province of Richelieu for 50 years, otherwise everything will be a “small regret”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Marseille tentatively asked: "Can I think about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin laughs "Of course, this is a big deal. I give you enough time to measure the pros and cons. This is a friend. Even if you finally refuse to take risks, it will not affect our friendship. To be honest, in Marceau, my friend. Too little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shifts the topic and asks: "Does your friend have a girl or a teenager who is fancy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;This is the first time that poetry swallows and crows have come out to "forage", and Augustine wants to know the record and results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Marseille smiled and said: "Yes, just don't dare to talk, afraid to annoy the order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine said widely: "It doesn't matter. If you have a fancy, you will get it back. If you don't send back a body, I can accept it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Earl of Marseille wondered: "Really?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Marseille smirked and said: "When I go back, I will convey this good news to my friends?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Augustine reached out and took some dust on the shoulders of the fat man. He smiled and said: "Marseille, your friend, my future friend, please help me with this sentence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count Marseille smiled and his eyes disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looked towards the White Elephant Castle and said with emotion: "The next time you meet, it may be there."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Marseille, who has learned that White Elephant Castle was included in the Black Swan Lake map, has always felt a constant shock. Even the barbarians have succumbed to order, and Maso County is really no one dare. Say a word to the young man around you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin did not leave, the Count of Marseille walked out of the Black Swan Lake in a difficult way according to the rules, and panted and hurriedly boarded the carriage with the help of the servant. The mood was hot and cold, and half was Because the good vision of becoming the empire's finance minister from the middle lord to the county governor, half is the instinctive reason for temptation, the mind of Marseille's mind is directly proportional to his body shape, knowing that the governor with that expression will always be warm and warm forever. Trading, there is never a free lunch. In the subconscious, he is proud to be the father of the spiritual mother of Maso County, but he is afraid of being the son of the young traitor. Maybe he will be drawn into hell one day, and he will work hard. Countless lovers Caesar can't save themselves. The Alpha city lord who was in deep contradiction was ecstatic at once, and suddenly he was horrified. With the wobble of the carriage, the trembling fat was intertwined with a wonderful picture. Finally, the count picked up the curtains and looked at the already empty mountains. White Elephant Castle, the barbarian heart building that is about to usher in a new owner, muttered to himself: "Is it a big bet? Is it dragged into the abyss by this madman or goes straight to heaven?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the good friend of Count Marseille, the good news is of course the majestic White Elephant Castle becoming the newest jurisdiction, and the emperor behind him is clearly and unambiguously demonstrating the high hopes for order and the moderate trust in Augustine. Political morals, as for bad news, because Augustine received a secret letter from Old Clough and was psychologically prepared for the ugly behavior of the Vatican's Holy See. Although the new pastor refused to expel the large-scale expulsion from him. The senior priests collectively requested, but it seems that there is some dissatisfaction with Augustine’s personal identity with the entire Holy See’s "teaching" interpreter. After a few years of patience, it is probably obedient. The willingness to do so has finally begun to write a decree. In this regard, the Academic Dean has a firm support for the Chief Secretary of State, Princess Rochelle, and the Rachel Tiger, who has been dealing with the Gospel of the mainland for nearly a year. Clearly showing extraordinary enthusiasm, these years have always been in the first day of the reform of the imperial paradox of the imperial controversy.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the front line of wonders, Augustine wrote a humorous letter to the old Clough, "The Academic Affairs Council should thank me with the behind-the-scenes operators of the Grizzlies." Old Clough hinted that he needs to contact Pompey to oppose this. The order was ordered, Augustine refused to use it, and then told the old guy that it might have to disappear for a while, and the old Clough did not ask. After all, there are too many uncertainties in the correspondence, no matter how private the channel is, there are risks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine, like the little Queen Elizabeth, didn’t show up in this room. In the room that was nearly filled with 500,000 dominoes, Augustine created a miniature magical array with memory, saying that it was miniature and The number of times a single magical array appears in the mysterious God's left eye in the tomb, and in the vast, heavy magical classics of this magical array, is often directly proportional to its degree of danger and structural difficulty. The fewer the number, the deeper the forbidden zone, Augustine paid 20 kilograms of blood for a whole month, regardless of brain power consumption or physical cost, than the two greatest achievements of his magical copy of the magical array "Sgarti soul elegy "To summon the mother with the Titan border, to be bigger and darker, the magic array is generally divided into three types, linear, powder and solid. The first one requires two magic wands, one material real wand, one It is the second wand of the magician - the spell, this kind of magical array, the simplest, but the best to reflect the strength of the magician, of course, the most suitable The second type requires the use of all kinds of expensive and precious magic elements to support. There are twenty-four metal elements that have been confirmed by the Maya Snow Mountain Temple, and thirty-one non-metallic elements. The "chaotic and inferior" dark gold There are six kinds of elements, their different hardness, rarity, melting point, live wave, closeness, flammability and cross-twisting degree are all serious and complex academic topics, the arrangement of various elements, full of gorgeous unknowns. So far, no magician has dared to say that he really mastered the most systematic element theory. Like Scarlett's soul elegy, it is the beautiful intersection of these two magical arrays. As for the physical magic array, God's left eye is the best example, and Augustine's quiet behavior, some wandering on the edge of the three, is black magic. The embarrassed and lonely queen, known as the "Winter Crown", alias "St. Carlo's Grave", may make many Imperial Gold Shamrock magicians unable to access these two strange words for life, even if this ancient dark magic is recorded. On the sedge paper, in addition to the rough magical pattern, the description of this magical array often has some writers' fear and hatred: "Human dialogue with dragons, evil spirits, fallen angels, and even Pluto. "There is only theoretical feasibility, but this is to challenge the bottom line of the biggest magical god of Saint-Carroll." Augustine was a naughty child to ask a question to the family magic teacher - "Mrs., you think the most dangerous magic." What is the array?” Then she gave this and explained the principle of the magic array in detail, but the conversation ended frowning. “This is a dangerous thing. Take the soul to exchange for life, even the most inspiring Holy See Saints do not dare to try. The key is that this exchange does not follow the principle of equivalence, it is more and less, the problem is that the human soul is recognized as thin, some creatures will hibernate Bringing trauma to memory is an example. You better forget this pattern immediately. It used to make a man fall into an eternal hibernation. He still sleeps in the depths of a dragon's nest because he is with an ancient dragon. In the dialogue, I lost to the wisdom of the other side. I must tell you that it is never a human strength to compete with the elements of higher organisms. It is like even a strong person who is known as a demigod, still dare not override the Holy See. Above the empire, politics, and faith, the power of strength will always be conquered and trampled by the next powerful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But out of childhood curiosity, Augustine still roughly recorded the crown, and then seized a sketch from an unknown undead wizard in the Kepler Gallow War. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is not a habitual person, but in the process of understanding Nibel's paradox, he caught some possibilities that even the two ladies did not ponder. Covert details, this taught him how to talk to the dragon. As for how to talk to the gods and the devil, St. Urban is in the summoned gods, and Augustine knows the experience of the period, but these wonderful feelings. It is more important than the Holy Ghost to abide by the principle of "cannot speak, can not be written", but this is still a gamble, open God's left eye, is the poor and crazy Augustine lucky, this time? Augustine, who bleeds blood every day to create a taboo magical array, hopes that his luck is not wasted. In the deepest part of his heart, he trusts St. Urban's last gift before returning to the hell of Tartalos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin asked Ulysse to host an underground tunnel from the poetry song to the white elephant castle. The one-eyed dragon has always been willing to pay for this kind of crazy behavior. The unpaid pay is like the larger singer's soul elegy that made the entire poetry castle ruin. After the white elephant castle was placed in order, Augustine was not prepared to move the members of the underground world there. Just let a hundred or so skeleton knights go to the White Elephant Castle and let the castle hall over there become a veritable "dead hall". I believe that the unlucky ones who sneak into the castle and try to steal valuable oil paintings or jewelry will receive a grand reception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This secret passage was named "Sunshine Promenade" by the excited Ulysses. It is really a deputy commander who is good at irony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excavation work was handed over to the most loyal and secretive Dead Sea Knight Descartes, the Titan St. Knight, made into hell, even the Lich King, Naples No one can survive, Augustine stood in the tunnel, watching the three most powerful courage in history, working hard, standing tall with a single ponytail, Augustin asked: "When did this have to be dug?"乌 /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse explained: "At least it takes two years, it didn't take so long, but at the beginning, the deputy speaker of Quinn and the masterpiece of the dwarf Aube, God's left eye changed dramatically. The geological structure of this area has made this a typical ridiculous place. The density and hardness have increased several times and can withstand the huge pressure. But in the same way, it brings great trouble to the excavation. A dog will be tired like a dog."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine said: "The next step is to go a long way. You will create a retreat during this time to give a heretical place for the heretical scholars who are going to poetry songs."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysse is curious: "Traveling?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin chuckles: "This is definitely not for you." The bad news, I hope that when I come back, the poetry song has not become your personal belongings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse dismissed: "If I didn't guess wrong, you Has the shaman’s approval been made to me?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin did not answer this question positively, just said: “You can find her to play chess. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse said with a headache: "Although I am the maker of this chess player, I will help you improve the details and rules, but I really have no confidence." It’s not a pleasant thing to win her on the board.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin honestly: “Without her You play chess, I worry how to travel "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Xiupao of Wu Lise hands into silence, face rigid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the "going away", Augustine officially received the "Stans Order" from the Vatican’s Tent, declaring his interpreter’s identity deprived Attached to a "private letter" of the Supreme Court, the end of the clarification of Augustine's right to lodge a complaint with the Holy See, Augustin burned this letter with a little magic in the study, not a smug letter, even the desire to save No, after some discretion, I just told the emperor to voluntarily leave the interpreter of the "teaching", and hope that the emperor can help to convey his gratitude to the Greenspan family, very official wording, than the big aristocrats to the court The year-end summary submitted is more sincere. After writing the letter, Augustine brings the scorpion boy out of the poem. He is going to see the long-lived pheasant. Miss Russell, who is already a librarian at Verdun Monastery. After meeting, the lady got a small box full of crystal bottle gifts. She picked up one of the bottles of "red wine" and took a sip of it. It tastes much better and is more delicious than the original one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustin breathed a sigh of relief and said: "I am very glad that Miss Russell no longer complains about the host of this host." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these are not Augustine's blood. He has no remaining blood to give Miss Russell food. Six bottles of wine are flowing from the blond boy's body. Augustine just thinks that the blood of Aris is simple. Above the line, but looking at Miss Russell's intoxicating expression, it seems that not only qualified, but also very sweet, which makes Augustine somewhat confused, it is reasonable to say that the youngster Aris was a descendant of the wolf and human beings, blood has no reason to be close to delicious, Augustine I have to re-chew the sacred spear with the golden spear. What are the two families that the giant is sorry for? Is one of them not the expected Apodi wolves? Augustine, who was thinking, was suddenly brought back to her thoughts by Miss Russell’s sudden violation of common sense. Her eyes gave off a faint golden color, but this thick-lined lady who was not responsible for the substitution of the parents into the world of longevity was just intoxicated. Without a moment of jumping to become the sensation of the long-lived female jazz, Augustine reached out and licked the hair of the teenager around him. It was really interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aris’s growth is full of irrationality, neither as human beings who are forced to go from old to middle age to old age Unlike the former dark night ruler, the wolf family has always stayed at a fixed stage of formation. On the contrary, it is more like a natural enemy of the wolf. The longevity that will erupt with the awakening will only begin when it is qualitatively grown. At the new critical point, it matures instantly. According to Gu Lige’s remarks, the child changed from a child to a teenager before he challenged him. That night, it happened to be a long-lived species that entered the collective sleep according to the new moon and ethnic restrictions. "Red eclipse", Augustine thought for a long time without a reasonable answer, so he didn't bother to wait for God to wait for him to return to God. He saw Russell's face horrified and looked at Ares, who was always awkward. It was an inexplicable instinct. Acts, like human beings seeing the gods coming from the Holy Land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin frowns: "Miss Russell, do you hate this child?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just got the leap Miss Leung Russell did not know the reason, but she said: "I don't know..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she immediately started vomiting and spit out The blood of the big beach, the whole person began to distort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire desk is scarlet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin frowned again. This is not a simple rejection. It turned out to be the rejection of the first parent’s “feedback”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine hesitated, picked up the half bottle of blood and poured it into Miss Russell's mouth. Soon, almost drowned, she quickly revived, more vigorous and embarrassing than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine relieved and concealed: "For long-lived species, it is a normal reaction after eating different wines."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only Miss Russell’s “children” who have become long-lived species, combined with her innate optimism, will believe in this kind of lie that is completely unstable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Russell looked at the messy desk and showed some face as a noble lady, which was like being at an banquet with an elegant knight. When I talked about the poetry, I suddenly put a fart, and any lady would be embarrassed. Augustine didn't want this long-loving socialite who loves mathematics to continue to be embarrassed, saying that he would leave Maso County for a while, but the wine would be offered regularly, and then handed her a notebook about mathematics and astronomical conjectures and problems. Ares, who has never had any expression, said goodbye to leave. Out of the Verdun Abbey Library, Augustine touched the boy's head and smiled: "Aris, I haven't watched the stars for a long time. I didn't know why you like to observe them. Now I understand a bit. For humans, the naked eye. The limit is 6 stars, the magician can only improve one to a half-level, like my teacher, you may see the scenery with only 3 brightness, but in your eyes, that is the most beautiful flowing picture, is it not? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that I heard the stars together, and the blonde teenager nodded happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin took the boy to the top of a mountain, sat on the grass, looked up together, the top of the head was a silvery ocean, because the climb was a little tired of Augustine gently Breathing: "In the hemisphere we are in, it is not the best season to watch this river, but I believe you can still see the pictures that many people can't see, Ares, in the myth of Olympia, the river It is the milk-juice that Hella accidentally sprinkles in the air after feeding the baby. You see, humans even have the awe of the sky and the gods in the romantic imagination. In the legend of some ice and snow countries in the northern continent, this The river is a guide to migratory birds, but in my hometown, a place far away to be far away, there is a story, you look at the two brightest stars, one in Aquila and one in Lyra There is a pair of lovers who are deeply in love with each other. They are separated and have a chance to meet each other in a year. Is it a sad story? But they are still happy after all, because they can exchange for one year. Reunion. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
