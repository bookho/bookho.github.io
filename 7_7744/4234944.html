			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Fiona and Louis Butler, together with Sister Branchi, who is returning to the "devout", sit outside the suite and write a private confession. They are surrounded by two The undead sorcerer and a skeleton knight who is comparable to the court dragon ride, before getting the quill and paper, and the sergeant and the pro-governor have pointed out the direction of everyone’s remorse, Fiona is responsible for exposing the words of the book Disrespectful to the Holy See, such as the Sisters of the Sabbath, and the unfair service of women in violation of the canon, the only thing that made Augustine dissatisfied was that the civilian stunner did not want to take some time to study the empire, even if he entered the upper class. The letters are too lame and the sentences are not fluent. It is estimated that the Holy See will be very troublesome to send linguists to study the report of the "晦涩"; the priest of the Earl of Heber, Louis, uneasily lists all the crimes in Mississippi. As for the nuns who had a good education in the Blanche Abbey, they used the fine words to sue the temptation of Viscount Heber, and cited the classics. A large number of religious books on the metaphor of the devil, the Countess of the Marceau County women's recognized lover, the incarnation of the book, the incarnation of the Satan in the Bible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stood in the window, dusty in the distance, and the 200-member Knights stationed in the north of the castle rushed over. He said to himself: "Let me know." Seeing the proud Red Heart Lion Knights, this is also a bit of selfishness that I cut Herber’s head.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On any epic continent, buy a knight and Not difficult, the luxury is to support a knight, especially in a peaceful country far from the flames of war, because peace often means that the Cavaliers have lost the opportunity to take advantage of the spoils for the owner, they are like the male peacocks kept in the cage, need every day The family spent their time trying to maintain their most beautiful state. The sacred empire removed the military aristocracy in the south and southeast, and the large family eligible to participate in the jihad. They could have a knight of more than a thousand people. The general aristocracy would not impulsive at all. The land is blindly expanding the family knights, because the resources of the territory may not be able to feed, and there are many gray mercenaries in the underground world that are not officially approved. It is really troublesome, as long as A sum of money, they basically can help settle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian Greenspan was able to ride on the head of the Lion King several times to pee, not because of the Black Knights who were slightly inferior to the Red Lions. It is the solid friendship between the barbarian and the second largest mercenary of the empire. Augustine secretly counted that the inner knights of the empire were about 37, and the red lion was in the middle of the game. It was already very strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin is still doing her duty to carry the bloody squad of the Earl of Heber, and I don’t know what it means. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This beautiful vase is worth 40 gold coins. It is my private property. I have to move back to the nest to hold fresh blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This cabinet Wine is the best vintage of the last ten years, and it belongs to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, this jewelry box has many pearl necklaces, so large, a string How to get a hundred gold coins, Augustine, don't rob me, they are mine, because I saw it first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The miser of Elizabeth in the suite Wandering in the search, and soon smashed countless things, not too tired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled and said: "I will give it to you, just leave the painting to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "What do you want these things to do? Take back the poetry brother's study, and then slowly admire our cognac nudes?" Elizabeth is sour, in fact, this group of women in the Marceau County and nearby counties has a faceless female nude. Dry, but very rich, obviously Viscount Heber is a guy with a mild love-mother complex, and even if he is not a noble lady, some young ladies are full of body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They are not only valuable, but they may bring me some unexpected surprises in the future." Augustine was too lazy to eat Elizabeth, who had a big sour grape. Of course, I really want to appreciate them in an artistically beautiful way. I don't deny this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin sneered, this man is not only The treacherous politician, or the knight who believes in malformation, is more like a priest than the old aristocracy, and is a ruthless and unreasonable governor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She carried a head and looked down at the Viscounts of Heber, who had wide eyes, and there was a sadness in her chest, even after being chased by the Pope's Chamber Rattlesnake. In the years, she was not so nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elizabeth, you went to Mississippi to collect the confession of the scum, the 200-member Knights have arrived at the gate of Lancôme Castle, it seems that they do not intend to directly enter Come, you should wait for half an hour or so to enter the manor of the Marquis of Todd." Augustine commanded, seeing Lolita butler reluctantly look like, can not help but laugh, said: "Okay, I promised that these are your private Wealth will definitely make you move back to the poetry brother castle. You will go to Mississippi with Louis. After you get your hand, let the little boy of the Viscount Heber take you to the secret room of the castle. There are a lot of treasures that you have to sneak in. Just hurry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth - ran out with two new species, the Lich King, who was still in its infancy, and commanded one of the toys to slap Louis, who had just finished repenting, on his shoulders, and couldn't wait to run to the underground arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can the Marquis of Todd with a huge red heart, the Lion Knights, come from the main territory for half an hour?" Mrs. Quentin shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, because I left Black Swan Lake, someone kindly conveyed the secret information that cosmo wanted to start with Viscount Heber." Augustine turned his head and smiled. It is very irritating to Mrs. Quentin, but it is also very charming, because her father who inherits the title of Count of Florence is at the peak of his time, his face is always habitually hung with this confident smile, but unfortunately with the attachment of Florence Flowers are stubborn, and the family has not risen, but has fallen even more. After that, Mrs. Quentin will never see her father showing this self-confidence and almost proud smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin frowned, this action is very secretive, she I have seen Augustine’s strict control over the castle of Shi’s brother. It is almost impossible for a fly to fly out of the underground castle. It is simply a cage that can only enter and exit. She suddenly looked strange, staring at Augustine, tentatively asked: "Is it you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin nodded, squinting at the Florence little Persian cat The chest, jokingly said: "Is it incredible again, you see, I said that the woman's chest and mind are asymmetrical."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin A cold cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin half explained half-throwing smoke trajectory: "A judge sneaked into the neighbor's house and caught a child with many unethical handles, but this judge did not like Like the ordinary aristocrat who can sit down and talk about it, open his mouth to Caesar gold coins, and don’t take the opportunity to say to the child, I let you go this time, you are friends with me. This kind of judge with a little brain is just normal The child grabbed it and beat him. He did not forget to send someone to remind the child's father. He said to him, "Go home soon, someone is playing your child. Then the judge sits on the bench and waits for the parent." With a large number of beaters to use the fist to reason. Do not recognize the chest than the head 'fullness' Mrs. Quentin, you talk about it, what should the judge take with the fist to reason? Is the code in hand? Or send him Beautiful and delicious female assistant?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Quentin’s face is blue, if it is not a disparity in strength, she will be happy to have a left hand with a head of the Earl of Heber’s head, a Augustine’s head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of time is only a little slower than the blood flowing from the headless body of Viscount Heber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin said in the direction of the open door: "Mrs. Fiona, Sister Blanche, come in and let me see your confession."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved a chair to the table next to the wine cabinet, and the two women who were trembling and trembling came to him and handed the record of two extreme cultural confession to the young darkness. The governor, the nun's writing is beautiful, mixed with many saints' famous words, swaying four or five thousand words, Mrs. Fiona's then twisting seven or eight hundred words, Augustine holding two documents, carefully browsing again, looking up at Blanche The nun seems to have no intention: "According to your statement, the prince Heber is purely a cruel devil, how can you easily give up your faith? The first sentence of this Sardinian teaching is What? It is the test of the devil, which can only make the heart of the righteous person more stable. Are you saying that you were a nun who was not determined at the beginning? Then what is the difference between you and the vases, because you Is there a nun's robe? Lamb Do you know how many nobles in the empire are playing with the nuns who are willing to fall? Do you think the Holy See will believe in your seemingly gorgeous report letter?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blanc The nun was pale, and Augustin’s stereotyped face showed a smile, saying: “It’s no problem, rewrite a confession, remember, Viscount Heber is a devil, but a treacherous devil wearing a human skin. He is very gentle and very handsome. The first time you appear in front of you is the image of a stalwart aristocratic stalwart. Your focus is on how he drags you into hell step by step, so that you are innocent, he is guilty, right? Now you still have 20 minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Blanche nodded hard, sincerely thanked the handsome wise man for the instructions, and spent so many years in the nuns, the age may be Her young 20-year-old man was the first to let her give birth to the sacred feeling of "I am a lost lamb, my father is a shepherd." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin turned and smiled at Mrs. Fiona: "Mrs, you are very touching."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Fiona is so weeping and infinitely grateful: "Thanks to the approval of the Archon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine looked to the middle-aged nun and asked a question, "Sister, did you indicate when you were repenting?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Blanche shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I didn't ask you this, but the Archbishop of Ram, or the Chief Executive of the County of Maso, can you still insist?" Augustine continued. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Blanche apparently hesitated and replied: "I will say, no one has instructed me, even the hints are not."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin admired, opened a bottle of wine, poured two glasses, one of them Let Mrs. Fiona send her to Mrs. Quentin, the kitten, and leave a cup to taste. This stuff can’t be eaten in the poetry castle. He looks at the determined nun and smiles. The bishop or chief executive is at most threatening to send you to the gallows, or to insult you before, but it is a small physical injury, isn't it? I introduced myself, I am the great governor of the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice, Who knows who is equal to me? It is Leshidun, it is Teutonic, it is Haiji, the great Prince Odis entered the torture room. What is the result? I can guarantee that you will never die 10 times. I hope to enter the torture room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Blanche collapses again, covering her mouth Afraid to cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of you is a big man who dares to speak directly to the name of the Holy Trident giant in the Ministry of the Sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Fiona, who was not well-dressed, stood aside and her legs were still shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For her in the bones or the civilians, the Ministry of the Sacrament is equal to hell, and the giant of the Ministry of the Sacred is equal to Satan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin interrupted Fiona’s fear and whispered: “The red heart lion is coming.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; A Knights, only sheep-like leaders will pursue the quantity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family training of the Todd family is that a lion can kill a hundred sheep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
