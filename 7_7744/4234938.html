			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the teachings of the Vatican’s Holy See, except for the jihad of “defending the authority of God and fighting the devil”, any killing is not recognized morally. Not allowed, it can be like a cumbersome religious ritual that requires a believer to abstain from 221 days a year, 365 days a year. The empire does not have a few nobles who will really abide by the rules, and even some of the great aristocrats like to go from the Cathedral on the Virgin Mary. Picking some mature nuns to play, so the Teutonic giant cursed at the time of youth that "all male aristocrats are not as good as a haired boar", which was speculated by the Empire that the Marquis of Windsor gave up family inheritance and eventually entered the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mississippi Arena is hidden under the Lancome Castle Dressage, with a downwardly sloping passage leading directly to the arena. The passage is not as hanged as a normal corridor. Arty landscape oil painting, the left hand stands with all the naked women, the right hand is the male gymnast of the male gladiator, everyone wears a Gothic mask symbolizing the Olympian deity, the Pantheon Olympia 16 God and 8 women The main god and the eight muse goddesses, the pure white mask with peacock feathers, are gorgeous, standing in two rows of corridors with many moon fluorites, which are spectacular. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin walked in the front, Augustine was half a step behind, like her squatting, and the scorpion teenager brought a cloak to cover his head like the sun. Dazzling blonde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lancome Castle has a beautiful young butler who serves them individually. This is not the treatment that any audience and gamblers can enjoy. Can please please the young lady who is close to Greenspan, charming and humble, explain to her that men and women wearing gothic masks on both sides of the corridor can choose at will, only need to pull out 99 Caesar gold coins, Lancome will be in competition The venue provides a special taste and elegance, both to enjoy bloody athletics with eyes and to not soothe the lonely body. The teenager even quietly hints that he can also provide services for Mrs. Quentin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin is expressionless and full of disgusting good hatred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Marceau rich or the Imperial nobles who came to the Mississippi Arena are mostly wealthy, they are very broad-minded and can take 50,000 Caesars tickets in one go. The rich are rare, and the tens of thousands of Caesar gold coins can be regarded as one of the top lords in the county. It is extravagant to spend tens of thousands of gold coins in the Colosseum and the arena than to buy pets in the slave market. It is easy to get the attention of the Holy See, so a nobleman who has no * dare to spend a lot of money in the Colosseum cursed by the Holy See is like shouting at the Ministry of the Sacred: "Grandfather is enough, come and pull me into the torture room." ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Madam, don't you pick one?" Augustine whispered, smiled and smacked, squinting at the row of naked men on the right hand side. Some key parts of "God" started after seeing Mrs. Quentin. The expansion is huge and spectacular, proving that they rarely see the lady of the nobles like Mrs. Quentin. Take off the robe and play the role of the knight, the Augustine "goodwill" from the identity reminds the Persian cat who does not squint.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then please pick one, I believe in your vision. "Mrs. Quentin sneered, and there was an uncontrollable annoyance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let her desperately be Augustine actually went to a fake Olympia god, the gods Father Zeus, took off the majestic mask made according to the sculpture of the Byzantine Owan temple, and then took off the classical mask of the mother of the earth, Gaia, the body of the strong "Zeus" and the face of Peugeot's "Gaya" Full of panic.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young butler explained with some embarrassment: "Noble knights, if you look at them, just explain it to me, once you take off the mask, They will be driven out of the Mississippi Arena. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will not be put into the arena. "Augustin played the pride of a big family knight, wearing a Zeus mask and leaving one to Mrs. Quentin.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The helpless teenager The housekeeper did not dare to speak out, but had to tell the servant to take the pair of men and women away. In fact, it was irrelevant for the two slaves to be expelled from Mississippi. The headache is that these masks are genuine masterpieces and there is no spare imitation. He can only Pray that the knight should not damage them. If it is an ordinary aristocrat, he can ask for a mask, but I heard that the young lady holds the glorious coat of arms of Greenspan, and the Todd family has been barbarians in Maso County. The death and death are under the pressure, of course, I dare not act rashly.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading the lady and the knight to the private room set up for the low-key big nobility, a floor-to-ceiling glass window is facing The Mississippi Arena is the most famous double-layered cage. This special glass was popular in the epic continent in the last 20 years. It has only one-way vision. It was originally a small invention of a heresy alchemist, unintentional, by Hu Fogong. A savvy businessman monopolizes technology and becomes the foremost rich man in the Principality. This glass has also become the new national symbol of the small Principality of Hoover. The biggest purpose of the Mississippi box is to bring a similarity to the distinguished guests. The thrill of sneaking in the crowd, the blood on the arena is splashing in the arena, but the inside of the box is the Yan Yanyan spring, many wealthy people who are not interested in the competition of Maso County are directed at this glass. Mississippi recruits, it is said that under the stimuli, it can erupt beyond the average level of stamina and combat effectiveness.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Junmei’s teenager repeatedly hinted at no fruit. The lady who made all Mississippi men willing to pay for it freely did not agree to let him stay in the room. He had to smile with regret and leave, and his pace was slow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bow body covers the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lost young butler's vicious belly: "What is elegant and pure, ladies and ladies will come to Mississippi? At night, isn't it the same to be crushed by a man?" At that time, it was a man or two men. Hey, madam, you are full of chests, two heavy plump-peach, sure enough to feed two extremely horny nobles at one time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Luo Tong Chaid, nicknamed the scorpion of the little god of war, Ares kept outside the door. For the slain of the Todd family's higher servants, there was no report at all, and it did not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, who has a mechanical fly in the handsome young boy, smiles in the room to Mrs. Quentin, her gloomy face, deep family education and necessary Hidden strength made her not rush out. The mechanical fly is a gadget from the Pope's research room. It is not a purely magical product, but it requires a rare spar to provide it with the energy to fly and monitor, so it also produces a certain frequency of magical fluctuations. Can be hidden in the members of the illegal division, the monitoring range of mechanical flies is also very limited, and the distance is also demanding. Augustine has always maintained a spirit of exploration for such fresh things, specially let Mrs. Quentin draw a pattern, let the horns lab work Two mechanical flies, which are still very rough, came out and I heard this wonderful speech. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This Todd housekeeper is more vicious than the woman's tongue." Augustine said with a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get used to it." Mrs. Quentin has returned to calm and her tone is slightly self-deprecating. Sitting in a chair and looking out at the bloody arena outside the window. A woman who just shows her face, even if she is a prominent woman like Princess Barbara, I am afraid that she can avoid the horrible malicious slander. An empire celebrity, without ridiculous cynicism, can only be the kind of embarrassing edge role. But the biggest difference between Mrs. Quentin and Princess Titan Barbara is that men dare to go to the front without a few steps, but for the latter, they dare to complain in the most intimate big bed in the family. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it very disappointing that I didn't rush out, fan his slap in the face, or throw him into the Horns Lab for a living anatomy?" Augustine laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't dare to look forward to it." Mrs. Quentin sneered, staring at the huge iron cage standing outside the glass window in the middle of the arena, seemingly unwilling to face up to Augustine who would never really be serious in front of her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hot hope? Can I understand it as a hope?" Augustine caught a small loophole in Mrs. Quentin’s statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"boring word game." Mrs. Quentin turned completely and planned to launch a cold war. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, in addition to a row of tables and chairs arranged for the audience, the center of the circle is the Mississippi Arena. It consists of double-layer iron cages, covering an area of ​​400 square meters. The first iron cage stands at 4 corners and is close to the strength of the big knight. Todd is from the knight, the giant sword is inserted into the ground, and his hands are placed on the hilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second iron cage is surrounded by magicians, arcans, sorcerers and alchemists, forming a response with the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with such a rigorous defense, the Mississippi Arena, which was not long before, had a Gladiator injury incident, enough to see the strength of the Mississippi fighters. , an arena, whether the scale is grand, whether the decoration is beautiful, or even some additional sexual services, are very second things, the most important thing is to see whether the arena itself can buy a superb game of competitive level. Whether it is a two-headed polar bear captured from the Kami Empire, or a high-ranking slave knight from the Titan Empire, it is only powerful enough to bring pleasing pleasing to the audience and gamblers to ensure the profitability of the arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mississippi is doing a special job because the Todd family is one of Lolita’s biggest slave traders. It can get a lot of good first time. The goods, together with Todd's close relationship with several heavyweight bounty associations of the empire, can take advantage of the relationship priority or even private bidding for half-orcs and dark species hunting from the outer continent, just like today, a short anesthesia with 5 kg of alchemy The head of the bullhead was smashed into the cage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of this half-orc family is the 7 mid-level Titan knights crowded in the corner, and the "Baibu, Hoover and Caucasus regions" "collect" 4 low-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Orcs, first as humans and orcs, were paired with "inferior hybrids" and lived on the bottom of the Muse continent, not only by humans and orcs. Cursed and spurned, it has been crowned with many horrible titles such as “plague communicator” and “disaster box”. In fact, they inherit most of human wisdom and fertility, and they have the strong body and some skills of the orcs. Originally, according to common sense, it can be the master of the epic continent and the mainland of the Muse, but it has been suppressed by other ethnic groups in the dust. This head of the cow head today became the finale of the Colosseum, and Mississippi used it to 5 The kilogram of anesthetic medicine makes it sleep, and in normal humans, 80 grams is fatal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An archer outside the field shot a feather arrow and nailed it into the head of the bullhead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tip of the arrow was stained with antidote, and soon the head of the head of the cow swayed and stood up, nearly 3 meters tall, because of shame and pain, it screamed Tragic and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole of Mississippi, but no fear, but excited to scream, especially the female aristocrats who are squirting, at this moment is more sexy than men, even a little high - Signs of squatting in the tide. They looked tired of the official knight war of the orthodox stereotypes, and the aunts of the winners’ knights became more and more numb. Most of them went to the wolf-like lady who was sadly discovering that those knights who were alive and kicking in the arena jumped off the horses. They took off their armor, climbed their well-arranged battlefields, and rode their mares, but they were often far from fighting. They were all blitzes of dissatisfaction, so more and more Marceau grievances would rather Come to Mississippi and watch a tyrannical male game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin took off the Gothic mask of the Father of the Gods, and moved the high-end tea food that Mississippi prepared for the guests, so that Mrs. Quentin would take The quill and ink will be spread out in the dusty "Sardinian Doctrine". This is a very popular book in the Imperial Aristocratic Circle for the first two years. It is almost a hand, and Mississippi is here. Each room is put on a book. It is said that after a certain archbishop discussed the teachings with a blonde big wave prostitute in a room here, he was in a good mood. He said that there should be one or two books of the Holy See. To offset and eliminate all evils, Lancome Castle did it. From then on, there was no church in Meso County to intervene in Mississippi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin picked up the quill and patted the thigh, indicating that Mrs. Quentin sat down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin certainly did not bother, wearing a Gaia mask, glanced at it, but did not dare to really anger Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More like a little Persian cat who was teased by the owner's tail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you come over, I will consider letting the guy who privately praises you to feed two old nobles into the cosmo, how? If you don't want to see it." My trial of Mississippi?" Augustine was carrying a quill, a bargaining merchant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin hesitated, still did not get up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No more, I am here to fight you." Augustine threatened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war between him and Mrs. Quentin has always been an epic-scale battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the kitten succumbed and got up from the chair and walked to Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin pulled her to the thigh, and the perfect peach-shaped rounded buttocks pressed against his lap, and immediately there was the male's most primitive physiological reaction. Mrs. Ding wants to struggle to escape, but Augustine has a hand around her waist, the other hand began to write characters in the blank space of Sardinian teachings, and Mrs. Quentin, who is ashamed and angry, can not help but stop rebelling, staring at the only one. As if she could shed the clear spring's quill pen, she saw the writing of the young consul in the poetry brother's study, elegant but sharp, like a blossoming aster flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two words made Mrs. Quentin frightened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"渎神". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, let naked men and women wear masks of the gods of Olympia, from a certain point of view, it is a god. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this kind of crime is most likely to be seen as a painless joke by the aristocrats who have the right to have money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin suddenly screamed, her face flushed, and her face was like a wall full of emotions - Ivy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because someone has got rid of the two people’s clothes constraints, the technique is skillful and fast, and finally, Mrs. Quentin’s resistance is not allowed, but the calmness of the action is madly piercing her. body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a wasp, piercing the honey-peach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shake the swing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daring wasp continues to sue the Mississippi Arena in the blank of Sardinian teachings, and the masked nectar-peach Breathing, the chest trembled violently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father of the gods lay flat on the table, seemingly silently mocking the mask of the mother of the earth that covered a flushed face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
