			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Saxon heresy, these years are the most spectacular period of time for the fire, when the empire’s jihad is getting bigger and bigger, the forest is not lost. The vast territory of some pessimistic leaders, even when the Empire first used the maritime landing to cause a huge panic, was still saved by a hero, the knight, ignoring the ridicule and indifference of his father and some elders. The two old masters who persuaded the soil, the March Elf and the Druid priests, annihilated the Imperial Knights who raided the rear, ushered in the greatest glory in the history of jihad, in several inferior battles in the frontal battlefield. This knight wearing a mask of gods is as brave and good at strategy, and has won the greatest victory for Saxon, maximizing the strength of the perfect combination of the knight and the war elves and oak priests. Before that, the two ally I have been reluctant to personally invest in the war. It is this knight who has won the respect of these two nature "close neighbors", not mutual hatred. She is Hera Bolsefele, no Fortunately, the knight who returned to the forest after being captured and rescued the returning female leader showed a more overall view than before. Of course, her strength made an explosive leap in three years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A piece of land burned by war smoke, the horsewoman who took off the mask took a group of children to plant the saplings. For Saxon heresy, every child should learn to walk. It is necessary to be educated on how to dedicate to the jihad. The tender hands are going to pick wild fruits, grow food, carry trees, blend herbs, or strip anything from dead enemies. Even if it is Andre's daughter, Hera Borsefler grows up like this, so on this soil, there are no women with white hands and smooth faces, all without exception. In addition to Hera and the unfortunate children born in Saxon, there are also March elves and oak priests who are helping to restore the vitality of the forest. When the forest becomes plain, it is the day that Saxon is destroyed. Everyone knows this truth. The children who have to learn to be positive and optimistic are relatively carefree to sing an ancient folk song of the Elves. "The Song of the Earth": "How many vicissitudes have you branded on this once pale green road? In your old age On the top, how many winds and frosts have been carved? The spears destroyed the village, the sword stabbed the earth, the smoke covered the moon, our homeland was covered with scars..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the night, the female knight sees that there are not many saplings left, let the children go home to eat, watching these clothes are used to the barefoot walking jungle, the children step on the dexterous pace, smashed, laughed and left She picked up a sapling and screamed at her. She was surrounded by a talented young oak priest. The priest looked at the knight’s eyes with subtlety and gentleness. He still clearly remembered the scene when she first saw her. Voluntarily accepting the moonlight test of the oak altar, she bathed in the glory, he felt that she was her own goddess, and later heard that she also passed the holy interrogation of the war elves, she with a clean body and selfless soul, and Great potential for war, to be worshiped Mars in March and sincere spirit of acceptance. In the past, the Druid priests and war elves who had taken refuge in Saxon generally only appeared in the case of man-made forest fires. They used their talents to extinguish the fire. For the war between Saxon heresy and the imperial knight, they did not care, and remained neutral. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The druids, which are called the Oak priests by the Imperial officials, are a group of lonely individuals who inherit the ancient wisdom. They respect the laws of nature more than the orthodox elves. They use the oak tree as the holy tree. The sacredness is second only to the Ursula tree eye. A priest must go to the ancient tree pilgrimage twice in his life. The second time is before the life fire is extinguished. Go to the tree of life and turn it into soil. It becomes the fertilizer of the earth. This group is the "special product" of the sacred empire. They are proficient in medical treatment. Sacrifices, history, and prophecy, but the number is very small, only four hundred people, even more racially than the March elves of nearly 800 people, the latter is the "tumor" on the elf family tree, not only betray the moon and the goddess of hunting And turned into a god of war, the reason why I chose to inhabit Saxon Forest is because the legendary Olympian foothills of the gods bathed in a lake in this land, staring at a white bull on the shore, self-sufficient The only son born, dominates the god of war in March and Mars. The war elves are not good at bows and arrows, but they belong to the natural "breaker" - the assassin, the strong joining of these two comrades, making the jihad of the victory of the balance of the balance began to slowly reverse. At this time, the oak priest Ninuta, accompanied by the female knight Hera, and the elf prince Duran, who sits on a hemlock, are the important contractors who signed the covenant on behalf of the race and Saxon heresy. Ninuta loves Hera But unlike Duran, he is not eager to respond. For the oak priest who came to the roots of the tree when he was born, the farther away the soul of the goddess in the centrifuge, the more pure the happiness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elf Prince on the hemlock has a pair of silver eyes, leaning against the trunk, looking at the moon in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duran has both physical and mental cleanliness and has always felt uncomfortable with Hera Bolsefele’s captured experience, with a thorn in her heart. He does not believe that the human aristocracy will let go of this female knight who is most suitable for the offspring, but the news from the oak altar shows that Hera is still the virgin. What makes the Elf Prince angry is Hera’s father, the nominal owner of Saxon Forest, and the great heresy Andre actually tried to arrange a marriage between his son and his daughter, just to bring more outstanding fighters to Saxon. This farce is quiet. Quiet, it is said that the female knight defeated the powerful and arrogant father, and threw the leader to the oak altar, and carried out a castration ceremony. The elf prince, surrounded by the crystal clear and small tree spirit, sighed, she was still too weak, and she seemed too strong. Every time she fought side by side, she did not reveal all the hidden strength. During the capture, did she get it? What secret gift? How much difference is she from the holy knight in humans? In the past few years, the big knight who died in her hands has more than one hand. It is a very horrible fact. The most embarrassing thing for the March Elf and the Druid is that this female knight who once knew only mere combat has now mastered it. A lot of knowledge: the canopy of the forest and the width of the crown projection, the deep influence of a war on the forest, the familiarity of the canopy fire and the underground fire, and the width of the crown projection. As a temporary ally, this is good news, but as a common Saxon forest dweller, this is not good news. Once human beings gain extra strength, they often have to wage war against their friends. In the far history, the sky will be The dragons in the annihilation, and soon the human smelters began to savage the elves and the savage of many races. In recent history, the longevity of the wolf race with human beings has paid a huge price. Instead of expanding, it has been occupied by humans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the knight goddess Hera is silent, planting the saplings, bidding farewell to the oak priests and the March elves, and walking alone into the depths of the forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glorious hills and a "Thirteen" only allowed the female loyalty of the female lord to gain a small increase, because she had too much presence on Rheinhatten More hatred, but soon, as the black aster flower came in and out of the Mayan Snow Mountain Temple, and a rainbow descended from the sky in the two continents, she stepped on it almost overnight. On the threshold of the Knights of the Knights, the current imperial knight, for her double professional master, has not constituted a threat, but the rise of this strength, the glory of a battle, does not seem to bring the goddess of the Knights More excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera-Borsefolf never admits her loneliness, but she repeats her dreams of calmness again and again, and she will see the waving hand He is quiet and farewell to the vague figure, in the dream, he is really lonely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight who has become the number one enemy of the Imperial Jihad jumped on a towering tree, holding the branches and looking into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elegant Duke of Elsie’s face is hung with a smile. But in fact, it is about to collapse. I cursed myself as a self-restraint and educated such a very unreasonable baby daughter. Although I was somewhat dissatisfied with the political marriage arranged by my father, who made Zusili a descendant of Fermoth? Moreover, the marriage object chosen by her grandfather to help her granddaughter is far more than the medium happiness level. It is far more than the medium happiness level. At least the young aristocrat of the gorse dynasty is not incompetent, not growing up. The slobber idiot is not a sadist. Even the young man was born in the gorse royal family and the qiaomena family. According to the precise calculations of the thinker Fermoth, the probability of his inheritance of the gorse crown is 100%. Sixth, this is negligible, but the position of the owner of the Qomena family is as high as 26%, 26 is very low? Not too low, the Qomena family is the fourth golden blood in the top ten holy families! This family is a simplified version of the sacred empire, rich in genius magicians. When the families of Fermoth are complacent because they have one or more old men who walk out of the Mayan temple, Jomena will surely disdain: Sorry, Our family has eight people, and that is dead, this number is multiplied by ten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Yilesha looked at her daughter’s graffiti on the drawing board, and had to bear the temper to comfort her: “My cutest, beautiful, gentle, elegant and elegant ancestors Miss Sally, I assure you that your future husband is not the same as his ancestors, not the kind of quirky magician who likes to turn a living person into a giant cockroach, nor will he make some perfumes made from feces, not even Do some boring experiments to change the gender. As for the rumors that the Qomena magicians like to be intimately contact with the beasts, it is too mean. On the contrary, this temperamental young man, like you, loves painting and loves food. He said that he likes some good things and believes that the biggest hobby he has in his life is you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a tragic grand aristocratic father who talks with his daughter and has to use countless “you”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zusili turned and licked a precious brush full of dyes. The Duke of Elsera was escaping, her smile was unchanged, her expression was unchanged, and her heart was somewhat proud. The prediction of the crisis by our children of Fermoth is strong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zusili yelled: "Father, I already have a handsome fiance!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The Duke explained helplessly: "Miss Zusili, that is just a moment when your great-grandfather was young and could not be taken seriously."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master of the Guizhi Crown, Miss Zusili’s great-grandfather was already over eighty years old, young? Fortunately, Zusili did not care about this, because she always likes to tell the old man when he is spoiled, you are still young, it seems to be the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Fairchild is most loved by the elders who loved and cares: "I don't care!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke sullenly said: "Zhu Sili, this does not meet your usual ladylike style."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been the home of Fermoth Praise "the princess in the lady", and the old master is also so told to the gorse royal family and the Jomena family. What is even more rare is that the old man was very confident when he painted it. Later he came to the White Rose Fermos family. The guests were more or less surprised, but they were quickly melted by the “motiveness” of the Fermoth family. The replies used the words “live and cheerful” and “good and pure”. Miss Zusili stood up and akimbo: "Father, my etiquette is taught by the chef. My arcane is taught by a magic teacher. My painting is taught by the Cavaliers, so you can't expect to be a lady!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Ilesha was shrouded in the sorrow of a brain, speechless. This daughter, when she is in a good mood, how cute and how cute she is, she will say to her great-grandfather who is old because of her age. "Oh, don’t be sad, you just hit the waist for youth." The moon is moving. "This kind of nonsense that makes the old people feel happy, but when she is in a bad mood, she has some depression. She will hide in the attic and talk to the oil painting. It is a charming childhood. Habits, often do not go to the Ken floor to eat, of course, this is based on the premise of countless snacks in the attic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zusili stared at her father. She seemed to see that the duke was quietly climbed up by the two whites. She sat back on the stool and pointed at the drawing board. She said, "I can bring the picture after I marry." Painting? After all, he is my fiancé."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Elssa said softly: "No, the fiancé who died will be more important than the legal husband?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hesitated for a moment, the Duke said with a distressed explanation: "Zhu Sili, your future husband will be jealous, maybe you will secretly burn your paintings." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zhu Sili calmly said: "Then I secretly kill my husband."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yilesha The Duke was in a tragic and incompetent state. "This is not right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zusili "considered": "Of course. I know it is wrong." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She quickly added: "It’s not like the gorse burning my paintings."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke He said: "I try to help you achieve this aspiration." <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Miss Zu Sili back to his father nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke reminded with care: "Is there a little wish? Daughter, in fact, you can ask for more, Fermoth will not grieve you. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shook her head: "Nothing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke quietly stepped out of the painting room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orphan Casimodo always stands in the corner of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zusley changed a brush and asked, "Is my fiancé handsome?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The clock tower geeks shouted: "Very handsome!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Zusili smiled and looked up and asked: "I was a child, or grew up." Later?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
