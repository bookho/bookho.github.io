			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the luxury fleet of Green Patty Harbour anchored, a large consul from the Black Swan Lake Manor walked to the border of the county of Juan County, behind him Did not follow any squats, like a headless fly, walking in the most religious atmosphere of the St. Russ Cathedral in the county, the cathedral is open to the end of the evening prayer, but this humble tourist hides in the darkness of the library Sitting on the ground and reading a book written by an ancient philosopher, "The Dress of Destiny Goddess", also known as "Compensation Paradox", the church's gates have been closed, and most of the clergymen have returned to their residences to read the philosophical works of the scholastics. A few high-ranking priests are qualified to go to the aristocratic banquet salon outside the church to talk about it. As for the bishops who are of high quality and do not need any supervision, they can of course carry out theological studies with the devout female believers in the cathedral. The temporary role of the role of the visitor - the 13th orthodox official badge of the Vatican, the founder of the Golden Balance, gave the greatest degree of understanding and tolerance to this kind of sacred god in the Holy See. Severe punishments involving physical desires, such as being handed over once, are to be confined for three years, but the fact is that many bishops who are good deaf children are happy to be sentenced to 30 years in one night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small monk of St. Russ, so hard? What book to read?" A sweet voice rang on the top of Augustin’s head, it was very head-high, because it disturbed the ruling The officer's guy was not standing, but sitting on the top of a bookshelf, swaying his feet, because of the bending, she was wearing a dress and she was exposed to a large chest. Not the official language of the fluent empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately Augustine ignored it, because I saw an interesting argument in "The Skirt", I hope that this long-lived lady can forgive her rudeness. The lady with a light and dark atmosphere on her head is just a lost low-level genus. She has just become a child of a small parent. This kind of prey, I am afraid that only the low-level red gloves in the night watch will be poorly half-faith. Point to drive to kill. Blood, vampires, lecch, descendants of Judah, all vocabulary not in the official classics, are contempt for this race, but naively think that eternal life is at your fingertips, they all like to live on longevity, calling humans a small and vulnerable short-lived species. Simplely regarded as a source of food, the Teutonic priest who guarded the empire’s darkness for forty years said a very philosophical saying: This race is like a businessman who enters heaven after death like a camel through a needle eye, a shameful upstart. But turned around to despise the poor and forget their original identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seems to be angry at the silence of the young monk of this St. Ruth Church, all species are like this, and suddenly it gets extra strength, it’s hard Keeping respect and pity for the weak, she jumped off the bookshelf and squatted in front of Augustine, her eyes staying on Augustine's neck. She was just a "baby" who had not experienced the first time, and could not smell like a strong blood. When you smell the breath of human beings, you can determine whether the food is delicious. Generally speaking, the monks and monks will always be more delicious and tempting than the civilians. Her unfortunate parents have said the deliciousness of this natural enemy, showing a parabolic upwards. The bishop's archbishop at the bottom of the valley, although the blood is conducive to the advancement of the longevity species, but the taste is really bad, it is simply nausea, far less than the ordinary monks without social pollution, in the eyes of this long-lived lady, this focus on knowledge Young priests must have a good taste, and her first singer can be very valuable. Since I can’t challenge the taste of those great people in the Holy See, I have to pick A clean point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine waited for a long time, watching her still hesitating to observe there, feeling funny, looked up: "My blood is definitely not good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term breeding 雏A moment, angry said: "You are not worried about your own destiny?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, she deliberately opened her mouth slightly, revealing two still fangs, Solemnly declare: "I am a long-lived species that has eternal life! I will absorb your blood soon, poor little priest, do you know how much weight human blood has?! They will soon become my red wine. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled at the pale but beautiful face and said: "According to common sense, blood accounts for eight percent of the body's weight, but experienced. Lecch generally only selects one-eighth of the essence, from the heart and the mind. For the priest, it also adds the right hand to hold the classics and gestures, so this long-lived lady, let me take the liberty to guess, you are red wine Tasting seems to be a layman?"<br /><b r />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She screamed amazedly, thoughtfully, staring at Augustine and asking: "Is this statement? You didn't lie to me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin nodded and said seriously: "I never deceive you such a frank lady."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is convinced, but On the surface, he still whispered: "You are just a little monk of St. Russ, how can you understand the secrets of our longevity? Are you afraid of being dragged into the Ministry of the Ministry?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inadvertently mentioning the Sunshine Department of the Sun, she immediately regretted it, snorted a few times and gently tapped her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin did not answer this very shocking question, but was curious and asked: "The Gunder Hughes family led by Prince Quinn has never been in Juan County and Lusang County arranges any level of dark lord, Miss, is your parent a courageous alien?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a frank lady. Worried sighingly: "Brave? No, it’s just a self-sufficient Xi Tuo idiot. After saving me from the family cemetery, I said that I need a witness to see him killing your empire. The presiding judge gave him a testimony and became proof that he was promoted to the family count. Unfortunately, he entered Hu’an County. Even the public enemy of the long-lived species did not see it. He was dragged into the sun by several red gloves. Fortunately, I sneaked out to buy it. A best-selling book, he and two wolf servants are killed together. I am very grateful to your empire's dwarf priest. His "Reeds of Thought" saved me. I will have a chance. I must face it. expression ! & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp thanks "<br <br /> & nbsp />;Augustine smiled. The Xi Tuo was once the favorite pet of the Bai Wei Dynasty. The pet also likes to raise the werewolf. It is the most degraded and despicable race among the 13 species of the longevity, even the crazy Maca. Weiwei and the ugly Luo Xizhen are not ashamed. The lady who just got a rebirth, luck is not too good. For the young blood genus, it is too important to have a strong family backing. Without adequate shelter, it is easy to die. And the unfortunate Viscount of the Xi Tuo does not seem to be generous enough. The crucial back-feeding process after blood-sucking is very embarrassing. Only the young lady is given a poor power, no accident, not to mention the sun, just a little more intense light. It will cause her to burn the skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin because of the experience of the night watcher, plus the dark servant of Dimit, the understanding of the blood family is beyond imagination, if Dimit now wants to collect A scorpion, after feeding back, can easily reach the Piaget class, and feeding back is a kind of higher and lower charity and giving back. It is not a lecch to suck human blood into a terrible vampire, and it is too fragile. The body, often unable to withstand excessive back-feeding, collapsed on the spot, for example, in the case of Prince Dimit, according to the principle, the child can become the Duke, but it is difficult to find such a superior container, unless the genus was a physique before his death. The great knights, and the long-lived species, have a lot of rules and regulations for the creation of the genus. The higher the level, the more cumbersome. The white Rose Aristocrat in front of her eyes is really a delicate flower. She can't stand any wind and frost. She can shuttle half of the sacred empire to this day. It must be that the goddess of life is fighting, or busy with the Olympian male gods. /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love is lingering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss seems to have forgotten to absorb Augustine’s blood, see the books in his hands, and yells: “Compensation Paradox? I have seen oh, holy ru Priest, I am very knowledgeable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin laughed and asked: "The question in the book: If the coin has been facing up five times in a row, then The sixth time it is more likely to be the reverse side? Miss, what is your answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire lady next to Augustine just wants to take it for granted, But I feel that there may be traps inside, and he tentatively said: "Of course, maybe, maybe...not!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin applauded: "You are really learned." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss was smug, not at all out of the irony of the big executive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine stood up and put this "fate skirt", which is often only seen in the eloquence of the scholasticism, back to the bookshelf, but did not expect the lady to mutter her own self-satisfaction: "If The average law is generated by compensation, then the answer is certainly yes, but I think that some special sacred objects have no memory. The balance of fate is not based on compensation, but is caused by destruction. I have listened. My father and a Domingo monk had a conversation. My father asked: What was God doing before the creation? The monk replied: He is preparing for the people who ask such questions. Hey, I am holding this. Skeptical, I think God, the old man must study my favorite pure mathematics before the creation of the world, and then the elderly feel that doing some application may be a very pleasant adjustment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is only immersed in self-indulgence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Augustine’s ear, it’s a unique charm, and even deliberately thought about it for a few minutes, originally intended to make this lady into a painful The big sergeant of the dusty dust dismissed the thought and smiled: "Miss from the distance, aren't you ready to have a meal? You should be hungry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She bitterly said: "I am really hungry, but I feel that I should continue to keep my precious first time. When will I meet my prince and give it out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled out a crystal bottle containing blood, and said with pride: "It’s enough for me to stick to it for a month."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin’s emotion is really a Sensual girl full of romanticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But an uninvited guest interrupted the warm conversation between the young priest and the vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He broke into the window and he looked like a wretched middle-aged man, but normal humans could not guarantee that he would jump from a height of more than ten meters. The moonlight through the glass of the church fell on the marble floor, watching the young man's body began to twist, the clothes were instantly broken, and a series of squeaky sounds of bone collision, the original 160 cm high or it became a head Up to two meters in the dark creatures weighing three hundred pounds, Sen green eyes, filled with the desire of the beast, the inferior wolf can not completely control their various bloody desires, such as tyrannical tearing the enemy body, still There is a hot and invasive nature of the Pentium. It is said that the royal royals who used to be punished by the royal family are throwing him or her into the cage where the lower-level werewolves are located. In this case, it does not mind whether the other is male or female. Moreover, out of the natural hostility to the longevity species, the werewolf is most willing to use the huge gadgets beyond the limits of imagination to penetrate the body of the female blood family. This scene is also a glimpse of the white rose. The most loved pictures of the perverted royalty, the bloody oil paintings of the werewolves who fought in the blood, mostly from the private painters of the White Rose royal family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the miserable young lady screamed: "You didn't fight with the master?! Van Bass, you coward!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select for selfish desires The hiding werewolf sneered and laughed: "I thought of Miss Russell's pure flesh, I would not want to die. I can only hide in the stinking ditch of the underground waterway these days. If you can't find you, you really To be crazy, I miss you, don't you be touched?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Miss Russell, the parents are not responsible for the initial embrace, but let her ignore the Holy See The sacred atmosphere of the library, but the werewolves who rushed into the church were thoroughly inspired by the wild animal nature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no strength to compete against the Werewolf Van Bass’s subconsciously standing in front of Augustine, in the subconscious, probably thinking that this hard human priest needs more than himself. Protected, and did not want him to be harassed by his own bad luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the cleric’s words almost made the optimistic Miss Russell cry: “Two powerful night masters, can I leave your battlefield?” <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf on the edge of the runaway whispered: "You don't even want to appreciate my 'loving' to Miss Russell, this is the scene that the White Rose Royals are fortunate to see. However, then, as a price to watch the show, I will eat your head, limbs, torso, sputum, human brain, really a sweet spring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin Lightly laughed: "Is there such a literary accomplishment in Tacitus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly knocked Miss Russell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, who has not had much patience with heresy, asks: "Have you heard of Werewolf Berkeley?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp When the young priests were questioning, the werewolf Van Bass suddenly found that he could not move. In fact, he was dragged, and he lifted his left paw, inserted it into his abdomen, and pulled out a string of intestines. Stuffed into his mouth, began to chew, oh, in the ethereal church library, exceptionally crisp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkeley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A violent man who has defeated the longevity of Prince Tacitus, has invaded the powerful Werewolf of many Tacitus females, that is the idol of Van Bass, sorry The unbeatable Berkeley died in the Kepler Gallow Battle. I heard that a human butcher wearing a red glove was driven by a shaman, swallowed himself, and finally had a skull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The werewolf with his body part filled his mouth and mourned: "You are Augustine, Kepler Gallows!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The space of the library was stagnated by Arcane The outside world will not realize that the wonderful one-man show is self-harming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin made a snap and smiled: "Bingo!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too long The feast is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin used a small gathering of flame elements to destroy a human wolf's head and a pool of blood. From the bookshelf, I took out a copy of the Holy Scriptures and put them on the hands of the long-lived lady. I went down and took a shot and took a picture of Miss Russell’s beautiful cheeks. When she woke up slowly, she explained: “The wolf is too big, and it is attracted. The chasing of the church knight, your luck is good, this classic covers up the noble atmosphere of your longevity, and I explained to a bishop that you are just a noble lady who has forgotten to read in the sea of ​​knowledge. I don't doubt your identity, but I think it's better to leave St. Russ earlier, otherwise the red gloves will come to the question tomorrow, and you will show up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The stupid Miss Russell resentfully said: "I can only stay in St. Russ, the outside world is too dangerous, there are disgusting Van Bass, and the ghosts of the night watchers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin laughed: "So if you only stay in St. Russ, how can you find your prince in a month?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She deflated: "How do I know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gustin proposed: "I am going to go to a place where it is safer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She screams and swears: "I don't believe that one puts it down." The lady is a coward who just wants to escape the battlefield!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin protested: "Don't forget, I just helped you to hide your identity, or else you will become The Cathedral of St. Russ showed a gift to the night watchman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lady with a heart is thinking very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, she felt that it was wise to leave St. Russ in a so-called safer place with a weak priest. Anyway, I can't meet the prince here, go out and take a step, maybe there will be good luck. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when she saw a golden tripod of a towering church in a forest path, she immediately regretted it. God, she was ignorant and knew the most eye-catching golden sign of the night watcher’s confession church. She wanted to escape, and she was caught by the priest smiling. No matter how she punched and kicked, she even used a bite that was not so lady, she couldn’t break free. Finally she sat down on the floor and cried, she The prince is gone. The ideal of using the advantages of longevity to read a classic book after another is gone. The world is so dark, the goddess of fate is so eccentric, Miss Russell is crying, and I don’t care if such sadness will lead. Come to the night watcher's death. She hates the guy who abducts the lady around me! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Miss Russell stop crying is a group of horror ghosts appearing on the trail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six black robes, twelve red gloves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the situation, or a group of senior red gloves with no low status, any one is enough to kill Miss Russell for countless times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She desperately thought: "I haven’t experienced it at the beginning, will it be dragged into the sun that will rise tomorrow? I knew I shouldn’t let go of it. This Saint-Justish monk, he has not had more than half of his family!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine comforted: "Don't worry, those are my friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would rather believe that Van Bass has the spirit of keenly helping the weak, and does not believe that the demon of the sacrament will be his friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin walked over and patted the shoulders of the first strong man. He said a few words that Miss Russell had not able to hear her ears, and then the priest took it. Her hand passed through the forest unimpeded, into a rose garden that built numerous angel statues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deputy presiding judge, who is this kid?" A young red glove who just entered the night watchman’s headquarters asked strangely that they did not find their judge’s body. It has been stiff like a piece of iron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several red-gloves old people who are stiff with the deputy presiding judge, and some of their faces are hidden from bad convulsions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy presiding judge named Albert is a powerful knight with a dragon gun title. He has been in the night watch for more than 20 years and has participated in and led countless games. The bloody battle, watched many comrades leave, and also helped many red gloves rookie up, because with the night watcher a dark giant with the same name Albert, was nicknamed Albert, for the general red gloves, the deputy judge has It is a big man who can look up, not to mention the fact that Albert, who is dressed in a knight costume, does not despise his position. He is brave and good at war. The low casualty rate of commanding the battle and heresy has always been in front of the night watch. Some newcomers have heard of this vice. The presiding judge’s leadership will be relieved, and the probability of living will be much greater. The deputy presiding judge is the tipping point of the night watcher. Going up, standing in the throne of the ruling authority, can be called the giant, and the governor of the general institutional department is not a dark giant, only like the evil dragon Ulysses. The consul, the great man who has accumulated more than 500 faith points, is the most amazing red glove. It’s just that such a king is too difficult to see. In the Ministry of the Holy See, it’s a hundred times more difficult than meeting a great heresy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who is he?" Little Albert bitterly, not knowing how to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to swear, but he doesn’t dare, God knows if the vengeful butcher will smile and turn back. As a dragon gunner who participated in the Kepler Glyph Campaign and was still a leader, Little Albert saw the butcher who earned a lot of faith but remained the most common red glove killed six in the runaway. Famous red gloves, more than a dozen Templars, more than a dozen priests of the Holy Spirit Hall, as for the dark species, and the short ally of the Papal Hall, there are more, countless, when the battle ended, Kepler made two More than a hundred tripods, the characters that were nailed to it included almost all kinds of occupations and warriors. Even Albert was vomiting on the side, and the butcher who was broken in the robe was only sitting calmly. Under the tripod, repair a gold pocket watch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the Kepler gallows, the night watchman’s top has received detailed information, a series of assassinations in the Titans, and a feat of summoning a mother to destroy the entire harbor. And the record of letting the Titans die for the first time in ten years, is the joke of this "boy". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy presiding judge patted the shoulders of the new red gloves, and said with a heavy tone: "I will see this person later, far away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angel Garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very optimistic Miss Russell immediately lost the pessimism that entered the coffin’s hinterland and began to admire the grand or intricate angel statues, and tirelessly gave the priest Introduce the source of each angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the priest never forgets to say: "You are really profound."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Miss Russell listens After about forty-four times, "You are really profound," I finally met a human in a lonely garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a child sitting on a bench in a daze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a pair of pretty and rare golden eyes, she wants to pinch the cheeks of cute children, but they are pulled by the priests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was depressed and asked: "Why?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine reluctantly said: He is not my friend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Russell is sulking, but still sensible, remembering that it is the center of the night watchman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Holy See of the Vatican’s Holy See, even the far west, it knows its horror, not to mention she comes from the white rose adjacent to the Holy Empire. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vision of Miss Changsheng, there was a guy she felt like a prince and a prince in the imagination of a young girl, wearing a white robe, slender body and a face like an angel. Peaceful, it is simply a vulgar Olympian deity, more handsome than the Saint Russian priests around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child is finally no longer in a daze, staring at Augustine, but asking the teacher around him, "Friend of the night watcher?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled at Miss Russell’s suggestion: “You have a famous Gabriel statue on the left three hundred steps. You can enjoy the independence of Archimedes, the greatest architect in the history of White Rose. There are subtle ways."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Russell left reluctantly, because the priest’s eyes were somewhat irresistible, but I never forgot to look at the white robe several times. People, and the little black cat lying on the shoulders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White robe god said: "Mayin, this is Augustine - Rotong Child, the commander of the order, the poetry castle Master."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child’s smiling face is mature that no adult can match. “That is the friend of Ulysse, our enemy?”<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looked awkwardly: "The new priest of the empire, I am not the enemy of the night watcher, I still keep the red from the dusk castle of Casa. Gloves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menin’s teacher, Eden Gaia sneered: "If I remember correctly, the pair of gloves, in the Battle of Kepler It’s completely damaged.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child smiled brilliantly: “It’s an honest big governor.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine is not difficult to accept the praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young empire new night watchman squinted his head and asked innocently: "Is this beloved big sergeant come here to execute your highest procuratorial power? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Augustine shook his head and said: "I came to pay homage to the priests of the Teutonic. You see, except for a lecch who has nothing to know, I don't have any obedience. This is the only one that the poor eunuch can take on the countertop. Sincerity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child repeated the compliment: "It is an honest grand lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine hesitated. "I hope that you can pass the application for order. For this reason, the order is willing to hand over the original "Wei Haiwen" of Ulysse."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Menuhin smiled. "If I add a body of Ulisse, I will sign it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin sighs and looks embarrassed . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minin jumped off the bench and walked to Augustine, reaching out and smiling: "You call Augustine? I like your name. As for the application, wait for you." Return the Ulysses and the manuscript to the two things that belonged to the night watcher. I will sign it immediately. Go, I will show you the latest statue in the garden, St. Urban."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eden Gaia follows behind this magical combination and the distance is very subtle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They meet the absent-minded Miss Russell, the long-lived babies who came to the heart of the night watch, the bottom of the genus, which is a violation of common sense. Beyond the imaginary fact, the Angel Garden has not stepped on the bloodline footprint for the entire hundred years. It cannot be denied that the blood family of the long-lived species, in ancient times, was indeed the only ruler who ruled the sun and the starry sky as recorded in the dark history books, but it was only the fortunes of the first three generations of Judah's darling. The gods and angels jointly created the sacred punishment, the later taboo word "Jehader" - specifically refers to the three generations of the former blood family, such as the "ice under the sun" collective destruction, ushered in the short-lived silver age of the longevity, and soon on the land The Angels - the human race to kill, the number of dying, and finally the creator of the Bronze Age, the prince of Prince Quin, had to sign a shameful "New Moon Pass" with humans, and formulated a unilaterally harsh command for longevity. The Moses commandments signed far more than the contemporaries of humans and dragons are strict and detailed. The territorial scope of the higher blood races, the support of the descendants, and the transfer of all holy objects are clearly stipulated, and even the most noble holy places are still gold.
