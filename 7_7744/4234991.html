			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poetry song castle was instantly empty, and the order took 50 powerful knights from the Kraft family, once again awakening the dark servant Dimit With more than a dozen undead knights and skeleton knights shrouded in black robes, and even borrowed the female elf from Professor Shirley, and of course the Lich King who looks like a human magician. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, the Black Swan Lake is running in an orderly manner, and the Cannonball Group and the growing team of girls are expanding the magic circle of God’s left eye. After receiving the letter from the Grand Executive, the Countess Marseille immediately dispatched the best construction workers in the area to the Black Swan Lake to create the arena. The Yangjiao Lab has been very busy, and now no one has the time to suspect that the New Sanctuary giants can’t bring shelter. On the contrary, in the ever-mature order, everyone in the Horns can maximize their talents. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agatha and Juliet operate an antique shop and prop shop that monopolizes half a street on the Champs Elysees Street. The business is good, especially the werewolf specimens. As soon as it was purchased, White Elephant Castle was the largest customer. The specimens of each dark species were purchased. Some of the living bodies were sent to the auction house of Marseilles, and they all bid for a good price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Fiona is busy arranging a group of "crows" and "swallows" selected from the slave market, and Louise is responsible for the preparation of the private arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly, Mrs. Quentin did not follow the Grand Executive to leave the county of Maso County and lost the ownership of the Pope’s antique shop. She is now standing at the water bottle of the 12th Zodiac Palace. Under the magical array, watching the sky, the air, there are several mechanical jaundice and circling lightly. This kind of gadget is the wisdom of the Pope's Hall. Finally, after nearly a month of waiting, a mechanical bird has captured and sprinted. On Mrs. Quentin’s arm, Mrs. Quentin stretched out two fingers and pinched a little bee from the mouth of the yellow scorpion, and a sneer appeared in the corner of her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whale fortress in a cool, luxe coat stands on the empire's border, silent and tenacious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange team with a gold balance pattern embroidered on the vest’s vest is standing on the wall of the main city, and the handsome young man dressed as the first priest looks around. The red fruit Gogol plains have been stationed for a long time. Several fortress ombudsmen stood far away and were very powerless to perform supervisory duties. Who did not know that this evil strange group suddenly rushed into the Beluga Fortress and then led the young priests to go straight to the House of Representatives, who If they dare to block, they will be directly attacked. It is General Maslow who stayed in the Beluga Fortress to take charge of the logistics. Under the wrath, a whole team of Templars was mobilized to arrest the unsettled guests who seriously violated the military discipline, but the situation is very regrettable. The end result is that the rumor is that the young man of the new ministry of the sacrament has gotten a few things in violation of the rules. General Maslow sent some inspectors behind him to prevent another accident, in the fortress. After the sullen middle-aged general smashed several chairs, he lowered his voice and sang a hybrid of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monk never looked back, and the clean and simple decent robes fluttered in the wind, and the lips were tight and the edges were firm. On the red Gogol plain that stretched out of sight, the battle was fierce. It was a huge meat grinder. It was destined to be many times more cruel than the forest where the jihad was, and perhaps thousands of fresh lives would be harvested in one day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soldier who has just been awarded a six-level yellow sunflower medal, a glory war badge and a bronze badge of honor with three medals was taken to the wall, he It is one of the three squadrons. It is one of the few civilians in the Knights. Because of his flexibility and endurance, he has always been used as a errand by a fat man. He is a veteran veteran who followed the fat man in the early jihad. Genna. Wagner, who has been a gunman for many years, did not get a little honor during the holy war. Because he was familiar with the head of the regiment, he dared to complain a few words in front of the freckled fat man. The fat man told him that as long as he was alive, there would be. It turns out that the head of the fat man did not lie. Wagner stood in the wind and looked at the strange back of the stranger. The veteran who was all killed and not crying because of the Knights finally cried, because he knew that the man in front of him was the master of Augustine who was often mentioned by the head. . Although the empire arranged for a reserve of 6,000 knights to travel to the hills for a long time, there was still no assault. The official explanation was that this military operation was not strategic, and there was news that the Titans also started all the sulphur counties. The personnel and materials have moved outwards, and it seems that they are afraid of revenge from the empire. Master Augustine came to the Beluga Fortress, is he going to avenge the head of the team? Can you get it? Will the empire allow? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin turned and asked gently: "Wagner, why don't you wear a medal, that's what you deserve."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old gunmen wiped their tears and shook their heads: "The Rhein Hathad said that wearing a medal does not make sense for the soldiers, and I am not qualified to face the regiment. Growing up, there are so many comrades in arms."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin did not publish anything, just calmly said: "Can you take me there?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veteran nodded: "This is Wagner's honor!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road is unimpeded, one is Augustine has a special pass issued by the military, and secondly, the team he led is too strong and barbaric. Arriving in the hilly area, the gunman Wagner gently asked: "Master Augustine, are you going through the border to the Sulphur County?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin Point Nodded, smiled and said: "Wagner, you will go home with the medal, try not to go to the battlefield again. The Knights of Rheinhatai do not need short applause and flowers, it is better to wait for you to be old. Your children’s statements are true.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunman hesitated, rubbed his mouth, dried lips and brought some slight bloodshots, and made a standard gunmanship to raise the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wagner turned and left, turned his head and glanced at the young Augustine who stood on the top of the hill looking at the Titans. Some of them lost their eyes. He was like a dream, throwing away that Three medals that made him feel ashamed. He was just an ordinary gunman without any noble title. He was in any corner of the empire. It was inconspicuous, but this week, the aristocratic youth of the Rotunchild family, It is not the same as the imaginary Master Augustine, the new giant of the Ministry of the Ministry, the great governor, the goddess of the saints, but these days Wagner only saw a quiet priest, humble and restrained, regardless of China How can Ghana work hard to link Master Augustine to the big nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the gradual deepening, the hills occupied by the Imperial Army began to see the soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin has a dark gold dagger in his mouth, this time in addition to borrowing a wizard who is good at leaping the forest, and let Quentin The lady spit out the early trophy "Lusi Scythe", and the newly named "Bishop" Lich King not only holds a sigh-level white crystal wand in his hands, but also has three singer-level staffs in the back, because the team The only one who can be called the Master is the Duke and the Duke of the Dagger. Some taboo magic that breaks through the critical point often ruins a staff. There are six undead warriors and eight skeleton knights. The next one is the Kraff elite knight headed by the great knight Jurgen. Of course, Augustine has not forgotten to bring the blonde teenager Ares and the shadow of Prince Dimit. He did not tell anyone what to do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the Titan border, quietly, to the end of the battle, Augustine picked a brow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the top of the hill, a tall figure with indistinguishable gender is dazzling and shining, and Augustine recognizes that it was Raphael’s Armor, which should have been placed. In the Office of the Chief Secretary of State for Academic Affairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin put away the dagger and slowly walked up the hill and asked: "Is there a secret that the Empire and the Senate need to collect secretly?"<br />< Br /> /> </ br> </ br> Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine frowned: "I left the Black Swan Lake Manor, which was allowed by the Emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Cosier added: "You just submitted the application. , came here without a written affirmation, and the tolerance of your majesty is only the default of your actions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin's tone did not rise and fall, hard way: " What is the busy chief Secretary of State to come here to enjoy the scenery? Waiting for me? Since the Emperor’s Majesty does not support but does not object to my rashness, are you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp She said directly: "Under the strong request of Prince Golen, the Emperor and the court army passed a secret military operation, and this action requires your cooperation. On the way, I transferred the Rheinham Knights. The manuscript of the paper, also from the night watcher, has read your report after the end of the Kepler gallows campaign. I need your experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin continues, Pulled a succulent silver maraschine and put it In the mouth, I asked, "How many people have you brought?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of the songs replied: "The Little Queen Cardinal Knight 12 people, Gothic Dragon Sword 18 people, 4 tulip magicians and arcanists, 6 imperial bounty hunters, 2 assassins who received the highest professional honor "creed", plus me, a total of 47 people."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin chewed the silver blades of grass that are not quite the same as the empire's common lavender maroon grass. The tongue is slightly numb, which is normal and beneficial to the body. He laughed: "Then I It’s enough to leave 4 people, and 47 of you will cooperate with us.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Secretary of State did not care who led the support, only asked a very interesting question: “Would you like to cooperate?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin asked: “Why not? When you are the main cannon fodder, I can save a lot of resources, order is not as good as the teaching The hospital, there is no whole small Queens Cardinal Knights, there is no continuous supply of empire in all aspects. Since we The goal is roughly the same, and it’s normal to form an alliance.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She retells a grotesque idiom, “cannon fodder?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine did not respond, spit out the chewing plant, stood up and said: "Do you have a complete set of soldiers ready for all levels of the Titans? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Gesell nodded. Augustine smiled softly and went down the mountain to tell the great knight Jurgen to lead the human knight and the boneless undead directly back to Maso County. Jürgen didn't ask why, it was crisp and neat. In the end, only a Lich King, "Bishop" Neapolitan, and the mysterious orphan of the Adibo wolf leader Ares, and the fallen female elf, so that Augustine really did not care, really The generous academic academy immediately took out 12 cardinal knights, not to mention the 18 swordsmen from the royal group. As for the 8 mage, Augustine is not a serious matter, far less affordable than the two "creed" assassins. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed to Titan military costumes, sabre, honor badges, and reciting materials from different Titan families, the only thing that did not satisfy Augustine was the accent, except that he could Speaking of a fluent Titan voice, even the Secretary of State has been stunned by him. The Queen of the song is only an apologetic smile. He originally wanted to play a young affiliated officer. He had to change his strategy and change the second-line family badge. In a line, and wearing a Titan second-class poison dart frog war medal, turned into a noble young Titan aristocratic school official, the Queen of the song Shere can only succumb to the position of the sergeant, in the jungle On the edge of the Sulphur County Province, the Secretary of State, who was eager to ask questions on the road, asked the professional secretary again: "Why don't we just put on the dress of the Gogol statue?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustin explained: "The members of the Gogol statue enjoy many privileges in the Titans, but each has a special certification badge, which is not easy to imitate, within our empire. The seized badge is only the lowest level of the 16-level badge of God's Red Whip. If you accidentally touch the knowledge, it is easy to be dismantled."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Queen snorted, but soon returned to the taste, frowning asked: "Why is this important information, why don't you return to the Imperial Army?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine I sneered: "I took part in the Titans twice and got 72 points of faith in the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice. Did the military give me a broken badge or give me a copper plate?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female secretary of state who was ridiculed by Augustine privately to ridicule the empire’s sense of honor hesitated, and finally did not refute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Titan Sulfur County is as poor as Richelieu in the northern part of the empire, the land is barren, the boundless wilderness gullies, and even the ore is pitiful. The taxation is not going to go naturally. The Titans have sent the most proficient financial personnel in the empire to serve as the chief executive of the Sulphur County Province, but without exception, they have been unkind by the inferiority of this damn county, Sulphur County. The Taitan people inherited the militant nature of the son of war, and poverty infinitely expanded this bloodthirsty and madness. Once the famine is encountered, it will cause large-scale turmoil. When it encounters military repression, it spreads away. It is the land of martial arts, the people are popular, the young and old are always natural warriors. The strange thing is that the imperial high-level knights who go out from here, very few people are willing to give back to their hometowns, and they are not willing to live in the sulfur county. Therefore, Emperor Uranus is used to comparing this county to "a forgotten old man", and the richest aristocrats in Sulphur County may be in the second line of the city of Uranos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine squatted on a red sand gravel bag, carefully looked at the Titan administrative map on his hand, drew one circle after another, full of jumping, no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary of State Gesheer wondered: "Are we not directly inserting the heart of Titan, Uranus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustine looked up and squinted: "Is the Secretary of State not wanting to add some triumph to the next war on the Red Gogol plain?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said she was puzzled When the team began to lack water, they saw that he had created a magical manual distiller, or he explained it as a method of plant transpiration to collect rain dew. This is the expression now. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin patiently explained: "The real elite of the Titans are gathered in the Gogol plains, of course we can not assassinate. But if only to go to Uranos to kill A few wealthy aristocrats, that are useless to the sacred empires, on the contrary, it is these locusts that help the Holy Empire to win the balance of the balance, and believe that you have also seen several other unpublished papers by Rheinhatten. The role that lays the foundation for a war is, first, the strategy makers, such as Prince William, the poet Fried. Second, is a pragmatic mid-level officer. So if we copy this theory to the imperial administration, then the goal is obvious, The person we want to assassinate is best to take the 7th level to the 13th level of the salary of the backbone, this group, can not enjoy the best protection of the Titan military, the success rate is high, and the aftermath is big, the only trouble is that we will have to fight one A long-term battle, this is not to kill dozens of dozens of things can be effective, so the Chief Secretary of State, I am here to give you a sincere suggestion, you still hurry Back to the emperor, go back to the Academic Affairs Office, where you need it more. Of course, if you insist on going to Uranus to take some fruits that look very beautiful and actually very ridiculous, add a glory to your resume, I am not qualified to block You, here we can act separately, don't worry, I won't ask you for a jealousy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seems to be a very heavy topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire of the empire, not far from the inside, feels a stagnant atmosphere, and each breath is subconsciously slowing down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but our Chief Secretary of State just asked a small question: "Augustin, where did you last time you can eat the Gogol cactus? ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine smiled slightly and said gently: "Going a few hundred miles forward, it is difficult to not see it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two are the smartest guys in the empire She gave the choice of compromise, and he got a satisfactory answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hesitated, like a little girl full of curiosity, asked: "In the jungle, what kind of viscous liquid do you give me?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin gently smirked, and I took control of a red lizard that passed by the feet and said: "I have heard of eating meat that relies on bright colors to prey on insects. Lantern grass, it is it, but I took out the lantern and removed the poisonous insect residue, hoping that the Secretary of State would not let the Secretary of State drink a bad stomach."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;歌谢尔The Queen snorted and was not angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin tossed the flame of the Gogol Wilderness specialty, and the corner of his mouth squirmed quietly, thinking of "careless" in the mucus taken from the lantern grasshopper. After spitting a few saliva and then handing it over to the Chief Secretary of State, his mood was finally better. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, who had a hard time getting better, put a squirt out of the medial longitudinal groove folds of the lower jaw. The small glass dish, actively explained: "Don't look at the flame king is not very big, the venom is a cute little thing that can be arranged in front of the poison. When the other two kinds of poisonous juices are combined, they will be applied to the sword front. I have stated in advance that this time I don't want to hear any knight spirit from the cardinal knights and the Gothic swordsmen. My patience has a bottom line. I hope that the bishop of Naples will turn them into more obsessive souls. "[< /> /> </ br> <br /> <br /> Wang Xi, put it on the wasteland, watched it drill into the sand hole, smiled and said: "The war will always be accidentally injured. Maybe the night watcher file does not tell you, the allies who died in my hands, in fact, quite a lot "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and did not express her opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin put the map on the gravel and took the root branch, the first circle in the circle: "Our first target is the nearest sulfur county. South Lizard City, an over-superstitious lizard that regards it as a city of the 'Land of the Earth'. The city's Baron, the lord of the mountain, is a fanatical supporter of mountain warfare. Every year he goes to Uranus to participate in the salon of the firm's firm proponent. It is not good news for the Holy Empire. This time I am not preparing any strategy to directly pick an accurate location for assassination. I will evaluate the strength of the Little Queen Knight and the Royal Swordsman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not reject this crude and rough plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin ridiculed: "I heard that the Queens Cardinal Knights are your crazy admirers, because the Secretary of State is the youngest royal swordsman in the history of the Empire, so the Imperial There are also many followers in the Knights, let these people take risks, will you feel bad?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Kosher looks indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southern Liz Town as a first-line town in the sulphur county, but not as good as the size of the third-tier city of Maso County, and it is not a little beautiful, because of the fear of the Holy Empire at no cost The army’s pressure, the Shiliu County transfer, withdrew from most of the county’s garrisons. Many of the sensitive local aristocrats moved to the Emperor County, where the Cavaliers were guarded, or went directly to the estate of the relatives and aristocrats. Hunting fox is a good entertainment, the desolate sulphur county can not have this condition, fox hunting? There are some ugly and dirty sand foxes in the desert, but these foxes are worthless and do not conform to the mainstream aesthetic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin plays a small-scale imperial superintendent, a role that often sneaks around the border, similar to an inspector of an administrative agency, enjoying a portion The privilege of independence and recession does not overlap much with the local counties. Augustine's sharp, one-horned rhinoceros badge means that he is from the most cumbersome Maupassant family in the Titan, and the scarlet poison dart frog second-class war medal is more eye-catching. This is the only way to climb the battlefield and take down the Holy Empire. A special honor of the mage's head. Before entering the city, he bought 50 Irina horses in a small market near the South Liz Town. This is a kind of blood-stained horse of the Titan specialty, and the horse dealer has not yet hot gold coins, just in the alley. Together with the slave warrior, the Maupassant youth aristocrat who was still bargaining with him for the moment had cut his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malay Baron is a small aristocrat who does not know whether self-esteem or inferiority has always been unwilling to receive the imperial aristocracy, so the handsome young knight of the Maupassan family was rejected. Was waved and let more than twenty strong knights rushed into the baron's residence. This is in line with the style of the descendants of the Titan family, so the street where the baron's residence is located is not shocked. What shocked them was that it was only a few hours later. The city’s lord was smashed into a savage news, and at that time, the superintendent had moved away from the South Lizard City. When the officials uploaded the news layer, there were many trails similar to the secrets of the Marais’s military law. Message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bypassing the county of Apulia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the province of Melody, named after the Melody family, a grand dinner was held that night, and good military news came from the red Gogol plain. After the initial wave of battles, the empire finally ushered in the first game. In the true sense of victory, under the leadership of General Andrei, the seven hundred masters of the sacred empire were killed. For the Titans who are rich in sacred knights, the Master of the Holy Empire has always been the most worthy of hating. The stinger, the Titans who have been on the battlefield will say that at a distance of five hundred steps, the wizard of the Holy Empire is terrible, and countless magical skills will smash down like a hail, and the earth will tremble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the dinner party, a handsome young man from a strange face ate the famous Bohr barbecue and glanced at him with a face instead of his face. The woman who attracted the attention of the woman smiled and whispered: "His Secretary of State, if I can hold your waist, it will be more like a nobleman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She Indifference: "Let you down."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Songs, who disdains the title of Windsor, has the advantage that ordinary women can't match, the body is slender, but the ratio is perfect. An intellectual face, elegant temperament, so not only let the elderly of the Melody family frequently look at the eyes, even the ladies and ladies who had the privilege of attending the banquet, could not help but throw their hot eyes. In Jupiter City, she never participated in a banquet. In the impression of the empire, the chief secretary of state was always sitting at the desk of the Academic Affairs Building. It was inviolable, but no one expected to make an exception in the Titan. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of vision, a young Earl of the Melody family, who was highly hoped, met a touching lady on the stairway with sharp, delicate ears. Even with the legendary elves, just a few eyes meet, they went upstairs to go to the bedroom to talk in detail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where to wait for the young count, in addition to the big bed, there is also a stealth "creed" level assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ullanda-Melotti, the excellent example of the Titan’s radical young soldiers, the only drawback is that they are too keen on the ladies’ skirts, it seems today It takes a small price. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hall music is ringing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, who came to visit Melody County in Harvey County, asked: "I am willing to dance with one of the most popular Pafans in the Titan Court." Dance music?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Gesser did not have any action. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin made a snap and gestured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dances alone, stepping on the most intriguing intoxicating steps of the waltz, elegant and skilled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there was a strong bloody smell in the hall, and the Earl of Marquis of Melody was instantly smeared off the neck, not many people. I don’t know where to go from the knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pavan dances halfway through, and the aristocrats who were made by the Lich King Neapolitan in the hall danced with Master Augustine, and several of them did not stand. Live people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new elf named by Heman re-entered the stairs, with a charming smile on the charming face, it seems that the young and outstanding Yolanda Earl’s luck was awful, and he didn’t taste the wonderful taste of a real female elf. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skip the county of Johor, adjacent to Melody County, to Kent, and to the air monastery in his youth, he has never participated in the fox hunting of Augustine. A high-profile fox hunting game, the fox became the prey of the Kent nobles, and they became the prey of Augustine, the difference is that the big lords from the Holy Empire do not need their fur. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the circle and return to the county of Joshua, in the blue Danube slave market that is most attractive to the local aristocrats, Augustine luck is good. Latin Grand Duke, bad luck is that the Grand Duke of Latina brought a group of great knights, which led to the loss of a cardinal knight and two Gothic swordsmen, but Augustine obviously does not care about this small bump, no matter what. The dead knight or the swordsman can be immediately put into battle by the bishop as a doll, so he succeeded in using the Lusi knife to cut down the head of the Grand Duke of Latina and throw it into the stinking ditch, not forgetting from the corpse of the big body. I took off a few high-level badges as a souvenir for the trip to Johorshire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The county of Jossier is located in the northeast of the Titans, and then Augustine decided to be a rabbit who did not eat grass, and went straight to the Mitchell alluvial plain in the south. , there, I saw the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a small trophy for the Titan mid-level bureaucrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than twenty forks have been played on the map that Augustine carries with him. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Titan Empire is clearly alert and has begun to dispatch a special "King lion" composed of powerful knights to search for the sacred knight "loyalty" Ted First, because there are several Byzantine archbishops who spread the gospel in the Titans, the Pope's Office even got permission from the Titans to mobilize an ultra-high-standard referee to the Titan to investigate this series of abnormal events. Before arriving at Mitchell, Augustine met with the scented "singing lion" and once again let the Secretary of State lose fifteen people. Almost all of the Masters were killed. The Queen of the Sherlock was angry for the first time, asking whether Augustine deliberately did so. Augustin had no explanation, so the Secretary of State did not say a word to him until the beach reef. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin sits on the reef, smells the sea breeze, spreads the map, and says to himself: "There are still twelve goals to complete the task, then you are Ready to go with me to the last destination, Uranus, or return to the Holy Empire?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood on the edge of the cliff, silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin put away the map and said with emotion: "The sacred knight is really different. This 'loyalty' Ted is only the most sacred sacred in the Titans. I really don't know how powerful the 'Silver Cup' and the 'Trojan' Troy are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Rochelle turned his head and looked cold and cold: "How powerful is it? These assassinations In addition to your elf slave girl, you, and the blond teenager, plus the prince-level servant you hide behind the scenes, can you shoot? What is the meaning of your allies? Or, you are doing a consumption of Titan Lose all my strength and then plan for me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stroked a golden double-headed snake wrapped around his arm and smiled: "You tell I am the reason why you let go of the work of the Academic Affairs Institute to the Titans, and I will follow the principle of equivalence to tell you the answer you want."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is silent again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin asked: "Is it the ocean? Through the introduction of Napoleon, the dwarf who just published a personal travelogue, you also realize that the sea war will be in the next few hundred years. The truth about the fate of the empire? But this kind of thing does not seem to require a Chief Secretary of State to personally come to the Port of Apton to investigate whether the Titans really have the strength and ambition to build an ocean fleet. So it is because of the Windsor family who fled to Uranos. The only traitor? Your nominal uncle, talented strategist Vincent Windsor? For almost half a year, enough for the conservative opposition forces in the Imperial Capital to brew a new conspiracy against you. To be honest, I am looking forward to it. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Gosher has a very good-looking eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is extremely honest: "You are very beautiful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her head and looked back at Haiping line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin got up and patted his ass: "In fact, you and I know that these are all mortal, their assassination and the necessary death will become a smoke bomb." Now, my best thing is what the conspiracy is, worth the sacrifice, Master, Little Queen Cardinal Knight, plus the Royal Knight, everyone is the wealth that the Empire spent too much gold coins to cultivate. Oh, I may Understand that Vincent-Windsor has no treason. The 20-year humiliation is waiting for someone to meet him, right? This idea may be absurd, but not ridiculous, how can you deceive extradition? Titan Empire? I have not guessed wrong. In the past 20 years, Venter, who has caused great trouble to the Holy Empire, does not trust everyone, and even has the possibility of total rebellion. Therefore, the Emperor needs a very unique and sufficient person. To determine this, my old boss, the Teutonic priest is not realistic. After all, when he is old and his body is not good, he has to be your turn. Maybe you are still mixed with some Personally known factors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State did not give face, facing Augustine, who sang a one-man show, did not say a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin rolled his eyes and held the gang and looked at her back. "Is there anyone telling you that you have a beautiful curve and put on a dress?" There will be a lot of people coveting your hips, maybe I will become a new pursuer for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the Queen of Kosher made up her mind to ignore her. This dangerous and crazy and vulgar ally. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, who was boring, stalked the distant elf and waved his hand, shouted to the side, asked a few words, and took a look at her. Looking up, get an elf with a new name and leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dimmit’s figure appeared in front of him and apologized: “Master, although I erased the traces along the way, it seems that I still have clues.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin laughed: "That can only show that the friends of the Pope Hall have arrived."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
