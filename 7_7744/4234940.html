			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(After 12 o'clock, the red ticket is picked up.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter whether the Tauren Chief will eventually be Lion King Todd secretly - executed, or gained true self-contained identity, an audience came to the Mississippi Colosseum to appreciate the landscape that has been recognized by several key figures of the Empire and the Holy See, whether aristocratic or knighthood, The gladiator who won the victory in the audience was killed on the spot, and it was tantamount to a slap in the face of the Lion King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most deadly thing is that this slap in the face is not heavy, but it is very loud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dazzling aristocratic world of the epic continent, you can slap a big aristocrat behind you, he may choose to be generous for the complex big picture. Forbearance, but in terms of aristocratic authority and family honour, even if it is only a superficial surface, it can always cause an unreasonable shock due to a seemingly inconspicuous little thing, and the bloody shuffling that comes with it. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tauren Chieftain’s huge body with a lost head crashed to the ground, and the disgusting iron cage looked even more scarlet and glamorous. The young knight stood in the center, ignoring The Mississippi side, who has been eager to move, waits quietly, like an idiot politician who is stunned by the knight's faith, and does not know how to live and greet Todd's Thunder offensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladies and the lords who had already prepared to scatter were sitting back in the position, but they were tacitly ignorant of not facing the mysterious knight and chatting casually. Slightly squinting at the cute little guy, for fear of missing a little bit of detail, the food in the county of Maso is delicious, the slaves from all over the mainland are delicious, the arena is also very interesting, but because it is too far from the city of Judit Recently, it has been contaminated with too many disciples of the imperial aristocracy. This is why the nobles of the foreign counties and provinces have been screaming. The aristocrats of the Marceau County did not dare to speak loudly. Today, there are individuals who dare to make trouble in Todd’s home in Mississippi. It is too rare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Viscount of the Condid family? I heard that he grew up in the city of Judit and he has always threatened to give the Lion King a lesson." The old jazz of the smart phone said quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the Cavalier Waver Viscount should now harvest the heresy in the Saxon Forest. It is rumored that the young Viscount will soon get one." Iron Oak Medal, if true, then he replaced the fat man Rheinhard as the youngest iron oak winner in the history of the empire, what a terrible glory, I believe that the Conti family, our mais county true sense of the old family It will definitely return to the mainstream position of the city of Judit in his hand." A madman who was in the forties who had inherited the title of the prince in the forties was a face, as if the rise of the Condit family was him. The rise of the broken family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princes of the Mt. Meso County do have a special affection for the Condit family, because Conti is the only ancient family with a long history than the Lion King. It has been floating for hundreds of years. Never stood at the apex of the pyramid like Windsor, but never fell out of the empire's first-line family echelon. It is almost the face of the Marceau nobles, and as always, for the interests of Maso County, not like the Lion King to defend justice for imperial justice. Naturally, it is not as unreasonable as the barbarian who was born out of the nouveau riche. Basically, all the Maso County families have been treated by Conduit, so Maso likes the "Boss" Condit, and sincerely hopes that there will be a Marceau County. A powerful character who can speak for the county, the emergence of the genius Knight Waver Viscount is a hope seed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Viscount Waver can be taller and stronger than him." A noble widow who inherited a large territory, smiled softly, and glanced at the name without knowing it. The young knight, instigated, she "eats" the kind of knight who is used to the Viscount Viscount, although he is still full of hunger and thirst for the well-prepared Conti Knight, but sees the younger in the center and the general temperament. Man, this lady is still quite itchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not the Viscount, the young man who dares to mess up in Lancôme Castle? Is it a great aristocrat from the emperor?" Make beautiful silver crutches and squint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who doesn't know, Lancome Castle is the castle of Lancôme and Mrs. Fiona's Lancome Castle, not the territory of the Marquis of Todd, here is private property. "When I was old, I had to use a tight dress to droop the widow who was holding up the chest. She had complaints against Master Heber, because the lion’s extraordinarily noble aristocratic heir was romantic, even Mrs. Julie. Such a blind man is willing to entertain, but she turns a blind eye to her, she is even more resentful to Mrs. Fiona, a civilian scorpion who almost gave her husband a green hat almost every night, after her husband’s violent It turned out to be the special favorite of Master Heber, and it is the hostess of Lancôme Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two old aristocrats smiled and were unwilling to make a statement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God knows if their private conversation will be accidentally passed into the ear of Mrs. Fiona, who is the least cherished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Heber is a heterogeneity of the Todd family, perhaps because the mother died of dystocia when he was born, and the Marquis of Todd entrusted the heir with many expectations. And petting, and only Heber can make the Lion King close his eyes to the Mississippi Arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd, who stood at the corner of the iron cage, gathered from the knight and got surrounded by the secret instructions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mississily did not ask about the life of this arrogant knight*, and did not verify his true intentions, directly subdue him and then brought him into Mississippi. The Chamber of Secrets, in view of the size of the aristocrats who are not low in IQ, this is the correct decision made by a guy with good political wisdom. In any case, since it is necessary to get back to the Todd family or should be said to Lancome Castle Face, but also to leave a little room, you should first have an absolute upper hand on the level of force, as for what is revealed from the mouth of the young knight after the secret room, is the follow-up action. For the time being, the child who slammed into Mississippi will never be good. The high society of Maso County does not know that Master Heber is a gentleman to a pretty woman, but a famous vicious man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark, a young man who is more beautiful than the young butler who led Augustine and Queen Quentin into Mississippi stood in the corner, holding a cup for the Holy Empire. The Soviet spirits that have not yet been circulated, because of the fascinating empire from the north of the land, so it is extremely stimulating, not in line with the taste of the imperial aristocracy, and occasionally there are businessmen who want to sell Soviet wines vigorously, and they all end up like this. The empire of the wine, not the arty of the boring rich, means that this guy is not in peace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood behind him with two genuine big knights. He is not qualified for the personal protection of the two big knights. However, just as Mrs. Fiona was able to obtain a manor in the hearts of Master Heber, it was not unusual in the eyes of the young master, he was free to call these Marquis of Todd specifically assigned to the young master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intuition tells him that the daredevil is not simple, but because of some kind of malformation, he became a castle red man, he hated the handsome young man who still lacks aristocratic temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, he hates all men who are better than him, especially in appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drank a strong drink, gloomy and sullen: "Even if you want to be famous in the Marceau County, you want to live out of Lancôme Castle. You have to get rid of the skin. You choose the object of combat, not me. It is the noble Master Heber, fighting with the younger Heber, isn’t it just a war with the great justice Todd family? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight who is already surrounded by smiles and smiles: "I am from order. From the Ministry of the Sacred."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When he said the first sentence, the ladies and ladies could not help but admire the man's courage, whether he is not guilty of the world, this calm is worthy of their favor, even go to the goose down big bed to talk about the wind and snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the word "the ministry" emerged from his mouth, everyone could not help but shudder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Mississippi Arena has obtained indirect certification from both the Empire and the Holy See through secret channels, as long as the ghosts of the Ministry of the Suns are still on the empire’s territory, No one dares to shoot the chest and say that the game can be legally and legally, even the behind-the-scenes boss of the Empire’s largest arena, let alone Mississippi, but I don’t know why all the organizations and trial members of the Ministry of the Ministry left the Marceau. In the county, there is a potential vacuum circle that has its advantages and disadvantages. The downside is that the dark species and some heterosexuals in the county of Maso County are frequent. The business of the Assassin League and the Bounty Hunters Association is prosperous and has many benefits. Just like any rich person can come to Mississippi to spend money without worrying about being targeted by the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the young man said nothing about the sacrament, in fact a strange and uncommon word, order, the four who are close to the strength of the great knight immediately hesitated, among them For the first person to subconsciously look into the shadows, there is the real manager of Mississippi, the Ascott Manor, the butler, a pretty young man who is not a good talker. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Irish Undead Book 7: The gods and the devil are hidden in subtleties, hidden in the details. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, it is obvious that the knight’s guy seems to directly ignore the embarrassing stage that is praised by the magician as the “European axis threshold” and summons one end. The Medusa demon, full of water, penetrates an iron fence without any blockage and rushes out of the first iron cage. The second iron cage corner has a magician and arcane that is coordinated with the Cavaliers. Home, sorcerer and alchemist, they almost always felt unusual magical fluctuations in the first time, when the liquid state of the Medusa slut rushed out of the cage, trying to rush to the Louis Housekeeper, the high-order on the nearest route The Arcane Master has done his best to stop the attack, but he has rushed to use the spell to intensively twist the iron cage, but only slightly blocked the unstoppable Medusa, the life-like 55-level Kraken continues to steer in the air. The behind-the-scenes housekeeper who directs everything in the corner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great knights who should have guarded the Viscount of Heber, although they did not like Louis, but in a critical juncture, they still broke out the strength of the great knight. Sword, together to break the Medusa sea monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
