			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Uploading Chapter 1 of tomorrow at 12 o'clock. Red ticket picks up.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Do you like my mouth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Quentin, who was not well-dressed, suddenly smiled and flattered, sticking out a warm, moist, dexterous little tongue, adding a little lip, Alice Calling her an aunt, Quentin, not only because of her sensitive identity in the Greenspan family, but also because her age is indeed enough to be called aunty, a mature woman knows how to bring beauty and charm to the extreme. This piece of water from the tree of the Byzantine Pope's Hall - Peach hangs down the eye-blocking arm that has concealed her chest's rich landscape, letting Chun Chun leak, Mrs. Quentin smiles at a man who is almost ten years younger than her. The voice is full of temptation. "My tongue can tie the handles of the two cherries."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can Florence not bow to unofficial power?" Augustine had some doubts about Mrs. Quentin’s 180-degree attitude. He was not familiar with the Florentine family, but he had previously heard of Florence as a vigil and a member of the Pope's office in the process of chasing and killing the Principality of the White Rose. It was a lonely family of the Gorse dynasty, most of which was from power. The big family that fell into the dust at the top of the pyramid has a common arrogance. Florence is particularly stubborn. It is said that the current owner refused the marriage of the EF, the popular family of EF, and began to decline. It is not a go, but a roll. , rolling down the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a handsome young man, neither a damn lioness nor a crumpled old fur dog, although not strong enough, but since In the hall of the White Elephant Castle, the body of the great knight is shown. I believe that your muscles are as energetic as your face. You also said that you are a man who needs to liberate his physique, and I just don’t have a stereotype. The ladies and ladies, since they are destined to be tortured in the Vatican’s Holy See, it is better to show enough weight to the Augustine adults.” Mrs. Quentin laughed, the voice was not ethereal, not crisp, but That hoarseness can just provoke a male conquest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean?" Augustine looked forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin squats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a mouth that makes Augustine covet, naturally not because she can reveal how pleasing the doctrine, nor is she good at black humor or cynicism, but like She described it as a result of the flexible tongue that knotted the two cherries. She squats down and lifts the angelic face that is more pure than the glamorous girl. The overflowing seduce is more tempting than the sorcerer, and the contradiction makes the man mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squatted to the foot of Augustine, the mysterious female boss of the pope's antique shop raised her proud chin, like a beautiful Persian cat who chose to surrender to the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she reached out and picked up his robes, Augustine closed his eyes, no man would not enjoy this emperor-like treatment, a mind and body A woman who is full of maturity but has a loli face. She may have been a middle and high-level figure in the Pope's Hall. Even if she was expelled from Byzantine and the gorse, she is now a barbarian's VIP. Under the feet, stick out the small tongue and gently lick the lips of the rose petals, what a wonderful prelude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Quentin’s face is about to touch the roots of the man’s sin and desire, and there is a blushing blush on his face, but this is behind the shy red It’s a hidden gloomy, her head is not close to Augustine’s body, her little mouth is not showing up, but a short, quick spell, engraved with the right hand of dark gold “our salvation” The little finger burst into a flash of light, just before she had only a few notes to complete the key moment of praying to the Empress gamma, the man who seemed to be stunned by desire opened his eyes and pulled one hand She took care of her delicate hair and pulled her up. The other hand grabbed her mouth. The middle finger and forefinger forcibly stuffed into the beautiful mouth of Mrs. Quentin's gentleness, sandwiching her delicate tongue like a beautiful snake. Augustine pulled her into her arms and bowed her head. The handsome face that was always gentle and kind in front of the ordinary was filled with violent temper and cold, and the hands of the big sergeant plus gravity road, Mrs. Quentin’s The body pulled up a bit, and her beautiful face, which was distorted by pain and humiliation, was close at hand. Augustine gnashed his teeth and said: "Is it comfortable, a stubborn little Persian cat from Florence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin did not have the intention to speak, because her tongue has been clipped by his two long fingers - tight, strange stings bring strange enrichment and shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds her of the crazy language that the young lioness of the Pope’s Hall once whispered in her ear: "Every gorse lady They are bitches, and every woman is a potential masochist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin did not dare to move again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Proud kitten, you conquer me with the body, waiting for me to conquer the whole world, you are the queen of the world, the queen of the mainland, you see, This is a more cost-effective and more pure deal.” Augustine dropped her on the wall, her right hand still holding her mouth and imprisoning her tongue, and her left hand was unwilling to cover one of her majestic peaks. He could only The big hand that uses the quill to write the most beautiful poems of the empire, while still holding a long shot and poked into the enemy's head of the Pope, can only barely hold two-thirds of the full mountain, which is a perfect feeling of fullness. Augustine’s eyes, which were purely controlled and driven by anger, were so gentle and gentle that they could make women think that his desires could flow into the heart like a clear spring. He looked at Mrs. Quentin, who was panicked, and continued to confuse people. "I don't know what Byzantine and the Papal Hall are doing to you. I don't know what the gorse is owing to you, and why you want to appear in the Pope's antique shop on Alchemy's Witch Street. I don't know how much you have with Greenspan and Alice. I only know that you are a minor in the Irish Undead Book. It is a heresy of the Pope's Hall. I am full of Meso County. The first poor puppet in the clear position, so I can tell you clearly that Greenspan’s rescue of you is tantamount to hindering my progress. It is a war declaration of order. I don’t care what you have* and the story, you Today is a member of the poetry brother, my little cat, the mother rattlesnake of the Pope Hall did not get your body and soul, I will replace her to complete this feat."<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Quentin shook her head hard, and the tears of humiliation swirled in her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One bite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smell of blood flowing through his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still don't give up? Then I will give you a chance to die." Augustine took out the liquid that was stained with Mrs. Quentin and his fingers were bitten by flowers. Right hand, stretch out one of the index fingers and gently rub on her cheek, feel the trembling of her tenderness caused by fear and shame, and the remaining hand is still on her unusually rich but not drooping pigeon. When he was young, the feeling of playing the piano when he was young gave him a unique advantage in caressing, full of aura and movement. Even if Mrs. Quentin’s fleeting tremors were captured by him, he used it, especially when he learned After the red grape was her sensitive point, Mrs. Quentin’s pale complexion became more and more flushed, forming a pathologically fascinating face. Augustine smiled: “Now you can continue to sing, to your master gamma. The imperial power of the Queen to pray for the undead is best to be a self-destructive undead. Otherwise, it may not be able to ensure that I will die on the spot. I may tell you a message that is not pleasant to you. At the bottom is a prince-level lecch with two hearts of saints, so you don't have to worry about it. You can't drag me down to hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our ultimate redemption, ultimately from the gamma queen who is in charge of the death and the tomb, your servant, Quentin-Florence prays to open the abyss of the undead, so that a pair of ugly souls can rest forever..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin’s eyes were determined, leaving Augustin’s right hand on her upper body, closing her eyes and beginning her finale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each thumb has every ancient Latin character 诡* bleeding bleeding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the price of choosing to hand over part of the faith to the Emma of Gama, which is why the small gamma, or black alchemy, is officially judged as a heresy. In the orthodox official cognition, a god who needs a believer to contribute a part of the physical cost is a god of injustice. It is the "wolf of the sheepskin, another demon" recorded in the Bible. Quentin-Florence majored in red alchemy, minor in the Irish Undead Book, and an assassin who was one of the nine major occupations. After being expelled from the Papal Hall, she lost her right to asylum and had to come to the Holy Empire for a decade and finally Marceau County is rooted in an old-fashioned antique shop on the Champs-Elysees Street. Her knowledge of the knowledge in the Byzantine and Pope Halls has earned her the favor of Greenspan. After long-term review and temptation, she won the barbarians. The trust, become Alice's "Aunt Quentin", is also a private ceremonial officer of Greenspan's flower, as for the secrets and bloody hidden behind the Kunding-Florence shadow, I am afraid that even Greenspan is not very clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
