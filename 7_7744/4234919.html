Chapter 3 is around 30 o'clock in the morning.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold The "falling" of the embarrassing directly interrupted the skill of the Archmage, and the black flame of the body was sprayed. The huge sound and vibration after landing prevented the Knights from cutting the undead with the Temple ivory sword. The soulless souls continued to sprint forward, escaping the first two knights with their long guns broken, and directly slammed into the back three knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time they succeeded in close contact under the cover of Augustine Magic Rain, slamming on the knight’s horse, one of them successfully knocked down the big knight, another The name is relatively miserable, because the arcane man behind the big knight has a focus on care, the Arcane seal plus the Cavaliers pistol, pick it into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cockroach fed by the saliva of Vulcan is much higher than the two undead scorpions made by the horns laboratory. It is almost holy. The difference between the existence of the knight is that it has a harsh time limit. The stronger the strength, the shorter the time, and the fewer times it can be used. It is impossible for any gold plaque to spend a lot of nuclear plaques to "fall". After the sacred empire sneaked from the sacred empire to the gorse, the golden plaque of Augustine could support it around the Black Swan Lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After it snarled, it was fired by the owner in the direction of the great knight, and all the fire elements in the nearby air quickly gathered, plus it swallowed itself. The small half of the bottle of Vulcan saliva, the black flame like a dragon rushed to the team of knights and mages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether the two low-level counterparts will be swayed, it does not care at all, and there is only a little bit of finishing-stage [soul-filled] killing and disgusting consciousness in the body. If you don't destroy an opponent, you can add a bit of waking state. If it destroys any knight in front of you and swallows his soul, you can extend it for about half a minute to refuse to "sleep." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Ashoka, who has only left two eyes in history, has been involved in the Byzantine and then destroyed by the Pope, only 15 minutes. Even if the Pope does not shoot, this perfect combination of all the wisdom of the heresy is only five minutes of life, but once it is given 5 minutes, it is enough to unscrew the head of a Pope's Prime Minister. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this is in the history of the Byzantine literature, "the gap is blank." There is no information on why the three pope halls of the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and the military and political officials are suddenly Disappeared, no one even recorded why Benxisan III, who was in his prime, suddenly died of illness, and why the new pope began to reject all gray areas after he took office, clearly defining the boundaries between darkness and light, and the bulk of the original can be The default field is placed under taboos, and then Byzantine begins the bloody massacre of the entire underground world, not like the gospel communicator, but like a crazy revenge who has taken off the robe and put on the knight's equipment after being hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using an inexplicable magical rain and a large-scale confrontation with the methodist, almost all the elements at the entrance of the poetry castle have been raised by several temperature levels. The magic element was originally a natural "inert element", but under certain circumstances Warming up will make them active, become creative, and of course have the instinctive instability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first use of two 9-level undead knights to use a gold 傀儡 to delay the time of Augustine swallowed the last bit [hot spring], his face has a pathological red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden explosion of the undead by the Cavaliers, and the metal and dirty elements in the body spattered like a no sign. The gunpowder barrels, most of the knights and mages were only slightly affected, because the tulip magician opened the shield for everyone for the first time, and then the arcane family also put down the therapeutic totem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the second undead blast at the same time left everyone unprepared, and a lot of dark liquids that could cause the Holy See and the Paladin to splash. This world pan-knight system needs to use the source of belief to replace the nuclear power of the magician, so the knights and the Holy See are most afraid of the loss of faith caused by the self-explosion of dark species, which is even more terrible on the battlefield than the physical loss of the soldiers. Because with the decline of faith, in addition to the decline in strength, their resistance to all kinds of magic will be greatly reduced, an elderly tulip magician seems to smell the atmosphere of conspiracy, began to feel a little uneasy, down the horse Detecting this ground did not make him feel uncomfortable at first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡 傀儡A gambler who has a card. Without the inconvenience of the undead, the great knights cooperated with the tulip magician with one foot across the magic threshold, and the three knights with complete pistols stabbed the three-meter-high flame-filled golden cymbals, screaming, two Grabbing two of the guns with one hand and spewing a flame at the front of the three knights, a tulip magician's nearly 60-level [waterfall] magic wall was shattered by the flame of the god of saliva, if not before the knight The tree has a defensive totem pole created by two great arcaneists. It is possible that the three great knights will suffer minor wounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great knights who took out the knight's sword passed the golden scorpion and prepared to cut off Augustine's head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin has been working hard to warm all the elements of the poetry brother’s castle, so that they all rise to a golden value of the magical world, even at this temperature. The most lazy magical element is also full of firepower like an elf, colliding with and blending with countless tiny companions around it, and then intersecting with other elements, so the battlefield of Augustine and the Cavaliers became a melting pot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's like a magic gunpowder barrel with a lot of bismuth and dirty elements." Hera standing on the top of the building suddenly realized that the big knight would rush to Augustin, and he didn't need him to look up. Hera Drop two copies of the Holy See that may be the fuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our foot is a damn large magical array, don't worry about that cockroach, kill the preferred target! Don't let him launch the magic array, that guy wants to follow us The same goes to the end!" the old tulip magician shouted. Magic array wired magic array, magic powder magic array and physical magic array three, the second most hidden, but also the most burning, especially the magic matrix created by the dark gold powder, it is only the madman and the big aristocracy To squander things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark magic magic array that the old magician used to verify with a special magical agent is a novel magical array that he has never touched. He doesn’t even know this. The only clues to the system are the two undead undead and the elemental atmosphere that reaches the golden temperature. It is inferred that the young people who are worth countless gold coins want to create a catastrophe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer cares about the magician’s restraint and grace, and yelled at the scorpion and shouted: “Destroy the black crystal wand! Cardinal knight, no matter what The cost is to kill him, don't let him start the magic array!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Children, go to hell together." Augustine shouted, sick red face Instantly turned into pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two unpredictable big knights speed up the sprint, one of the knights directly smashed the temple ivory sword to Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Put the brilliance on the earth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin spreads the hand, 230 pages The Ivan Grand Ceremony and the 352-page "Noah Theology Collection" suddenly spread out on the battlefield, forming two huge circles, the circle just happens to be the center of the golden dragonfly, and the radius is the Titan longan staff to the gold. Hey, the other radius is the last old tulip magician to the golden dragonfly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the magical array at the feet of the knights was "pushed" and finally revealed their teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"[永生]."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
