			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Meso County upper-class cram suddenly heard a less comfortable voice, looked up and saw a shabby young man, a priest? If it weren't for a woman with a rare stature standing next to him, they would definitely shift their sights for the first time and turn a blind eye to the outside of this vast landscape. The man who didn't see the title and * smiled: "I was lucky enough to make a small profit, and in a few months, I could double it again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oh? How many Caesar?" The fat man who lost 5,000 gold coins sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"12 Bourbon silver coins, doubled, is 24 pieces." The man smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone stunned, and then smiled at each other, sighing the woman around the young man and blinking, and this poor light egg. Some have begun to calculate whether they can spend some gold coins to lure her into her big bed. Although they are not the most important partner of the Condit family, they can occupy the well-lit corner of the hall, close to the bookshelf. For them, this is the obvious identification. You must know that there are many people who have no seats in the forest villa. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent Mrs. Quentin suddenly felt a sorrow, half because she might have been accustomed to being blinded as someone’s private pet for the rest of her life, half It is funny for this group of seemingly noble Marceau second and third-line figures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of fools know who they are talking to? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a chat, someone was in a good mood, telling Mrs. Quentin a paragraph, saying that when he left the Kraft family residence in Jupiter City, The old owner made a bet according to the rules of the Grizzly gambling. The initial gambling money was a Bourbon silver coin. After one month, the order did not die. The owner of the house, Pollock, would lose 2 of them, 6 months and 6 pieces. Not dead, it is 12 pieces, and then doubled after one year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24 Bourbon silver coins, I am afraid that in the eyes of any empire aristocrats are not worth mentioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But don't forget who the money came from. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polock, the "Kremlin Count" of the Clough family that was resurrected after more than 20 years of painstaking practice at the Ola Theological Seminary, which is the most in the capital One of the evil old generation aristocrats, his darkness, and the demise of the Pompeii family is a legendary series, Windsor, Kroof, Pompeii, these are the true family of Jupiter, sacred The real power of the empire. The old man who claimed to have played the various nobles of various countries and even the elders of the elves, but recognized a private priest in the confession room of the top of the mountain in Oula. This unusually young priest solved the problem that plagued his life, and finally he was willing to give up the arrogant request for "the Lord personally extended his hand to show himself and speak to me", and it was because of this color - love The martyrdom of the senior politician in the old coat, indirectly, let Augustine help the godfather Iyta complete the final link of "Teaching." It is said that the Marquis of Germans in Greenspan has always worshipped the same type of "Vampire Count" and praised the old man as the true politician of the empire. The answer from Kraff’s homeowner was to go to his mother’s politician. I am a believer, a devout believer with a noble and profound private priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine has already got 12 bourbon silver coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every piece means 10 lavish family loyalty from the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is his secret agreement with the old man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, the young and ambitious priest has a warm relationship with the confessor who is too old to refuse to rest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lolly butler in the "Honey" nest of the Poetry Castle once asked about how many "Lambs" Augustine had stocked, and Augustine did not answer, but Miss Elizabeth is currently known to have four heads of the night watchman organization, plus the soon to be stocked, the Saxon Knight goddess Hera, there are already five cards that have not been uncovered. These cards may not be used in the future. The housekeeper of Lili was raised by the "Salvation of the Vulcan". In the eyes of outsiders, the order of the little babies in the Black Swan Lake may die from the small waves at any time. In fact, the Todd family's lion king thousand Knights As long as there is a wave of irresponsible casualties, the fourth institution of the ruling under the castle of Poetry brothers can not withstand the current stage. The asylum of Jupiter’s asylum is fading away. Fortunately, the poem It is also growing fast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Augustine and Mrs. Quentin’s dress today is very different from that to the Mississippi Arena, and their deliberate low-key, many hands trembled and sent The nobles of the confession did not recognize the man who was the chief executive of the head of the Tauren Chieftain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is not angry with this group of rich people who use him as a tea after dinner, just like he himself liked to be the godfather of the godfather. Together with the young master, plus the current student of the Dean of the Aura Monastery, the magician York, to discuss the empire's little Ainas Princess and the Titan's Princess Barbara who is more beautiful, this is a common problem for all nobles on the mainland, Not only humans, but also the lecch, the werewolf, and all the high-ranking races on the Muse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Augustin." Alice was finally busy. Although she did not have the smooth communication of the old aristocrats, she received the education of excellent family etiquette from an early age, and the basic entertainment She is not too difficult. Moreover, the title of the barbarian heir is enough for the pretty young lady who does not like politics to study military on paper and chessboard. She is more than a lot of ladies and ladies in the hall. To lighten the small floral skirt, run to Augustine, smile and greet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was not up to the brightest heirs of the Condit family when she was chatting upstairs. This made the noble knight who saw this scene on the spiral staircase frown, turned his head and whispered to ask the housekeeper around him, and got the answer. After that, the knight wearing only two medals on his chest narrowed his eyes and slowed down. She is the heart of the barbarian. He is the unmistakable future owner of the Conti family. She is behind the fearful upstarts, the upstarts in the emperor and the old veteran families, and behind him is a long-standing family tree. A large number of administrative governors, court tax collectors, barbarians need the foundation, old Cond need fresh power, in the eyes of anyone, he and she are the most suitable couples, couples, and allies in the province of Maso. He, Viscount Waver, cultivated a habit of suffocating the enemy to death in the Saxon Forest. Undoubtedly, any role that hindered him from obtaining the huge dowry of Greenspan was an enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Sir Hank, who lost 5,000 Caesar, your confession is still on my desk. It seems that your confession is still one less The important one, you seem to want a 'little person' in a sacrament to live this year." Augustine laughed at the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man finally remembered that this unsightly but familiar young man was the giant of the Ministry of the Ministry, a character that he must be begged to die within three months of betting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Alice, the banquet is almost coming to an end, you leave first, I will go back to Black Swan Lake myself." Augustine whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice is very clever enough to leave the hall, the old housekeeper Asa is worried, looking to the Viscount Viscount on the stairs, gently withdrawing the line of sight, sigh in the heart, the old man I only hope that the "friendly" neighbor who cut off the head of the Marquis of Todd will not make another bloody battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Augustine disappointed the old housekeeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When leaving the Villa of the Bliss, the body of the fat jazz was hung on the angel statue in the center of the fountain, and the blood was flowing, and it was quickly diluted by the spring water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was stunned by the glamorous level of the assassination technique, Mrs. Quentin pierced her neck, then dragged out of the hall and threw him onto the angel sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lady is worthy of being a top assassin who is only a few steps away from the hunter. The murderous technique is full of artistic tension, bloody, but not cruel, even one A beauty that creates inspiration for nearby bards. The war created the soldiers, and the most talented and soulful poets. This sentence is the famous poet of the most famous epic in the mainland. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
