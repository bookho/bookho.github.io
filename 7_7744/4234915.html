			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysterious witch professor who accompanied Augustine through his childhood gave him a strange world view. In this complex world where the dragon has a deep abyss and the knight has a powerful mage, everything Both can be deconstructed and analyzed by numbers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Augustine developed a good habit of treating details as the cutest devil. Only one of the Cavaliers' squad named Philippe had a good score on his notes. The approximate data was physical strength 20, agility 15, intelligence 65, explosive power 35, spell potential 50, belief size 70, and belief quality 85. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is superior to the rest of the average price of only 15 baht, so Augustine appointed him as the deputy head of the Youth Knights. Everything in daily life, including setting up tents on the outskirts of the castle of Poetry, is working hard for the next top secret mission, the taboo magical array "God's Left Eye." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The head of the New Knights is of course Hera, but according to Augustin’s instructions, she must first teach fifteen young girls who are afraid that even the Empire’s letters are unknown. To record and draw, and to achieve the level of line accuracy at the singer level, this is almost an unfinished and arduous task, but Augustine did not leave a room for the sorcerer of the Arcane, and Hera did not expect to fight for a little. Breathing opportunities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights headed by Philippine are not allowed to be near the Poetry Castle and the Black Swan Lake behind the castle, Augustine with Hera and fifteen girls At the entrance to the castle of Shizige, Elizabeth commanded the horse to drag the two carriages behind her. She now does not forget to read "Flowers and Blood 2" even now. Her greatest ambition is to grab the author and give her every day. Written 10,000 times "The Queen Elizabeth is the most beautiful woman in the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worn-out carriage is loaded with daily necessities for the shofar tissue, and the Earl of Marseille loves it. The collections on the carriage were also taken by Augustine to let the girls move down. Not surprisingly, the girl who took the most heavy thing was the beautiful Agatha. After two days of running-in, she is now the leader of the girls. A soft-skinned girl can show a moving smile as naturally as possible even if she faces Augustine several times. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at least the indifference of Juliet, the last place in the team is always a weak Jane, the former just mentions a sapphire from the Peacock Dynasty The bottle, the latter is licking the thin body, holding the carpet that most people are willing to touch, she never even dared to look at people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Augustine didn't know why Hera was able to choose only the ordinary child who only priced 2 silver coins in the Lolita slave pile by instinct. At that time, her identity card hanging around her neck just wrote a word, Jane. This is the whole of her life. There is no glory. There is nothing that is worthy of sorrow. It is directly ignored when she is born, but Augustine still chooses to believe in the vision of a female Arcane, and she claims to be Luck has been above the horizon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the place where you may not be able to get rid of all your life. You must be attached to me, but what I can guarantee is that you will not go hungry and will not be missed. I was whipped for no reason, even if he is the richest and most powerful aristocratic priest in the county of Maso. Therefore, I have a reasonable request. Please choose the unreserved one from the first step in the castle gate. Body, soul, faith, give everything to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin said before entering the poetry castle, he thought he was more expressive The aristocratic rhetoric, as for those children who are not complicated enough to understand, he does not expect. Then the guy who had more than a dozen loli all of a sudden pointed at the worn-out carriage and smiled: "There is a bag at the bottom of the car, and there is a heresy that is dying. Who will help me into the castle, maybe a bit heavy, There may even be blood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only two girls who left the team in the first place, still in the Augustine predictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful Agatha from the Bai Weiwei art family, and the great aristocratic girl Juliet who was sold from the gorse dynasty according to the slave trader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A price is 12 gold coins, which can be sold at the price of Agatha’s current immature body. Thanks to her ability to play a piano and write prose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is 11 Caesar gold coins, the beauty and body up space is not significant, she can be so "expensive", naturally relying on her many buyers are not The illustrious identity that is willing to believe, after all, even if the aristocrats are like a dog's gorse dynasty, a Marquis daughter can not be easily deceived. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gently put down the items in their hands, then drilled under the carriage almost at the same time, untied the ropes, and the two lifted the "corpse" of the big knight Descartes They were bloody, and they looked firmly at Augustine, waiting for the new master's instructions. Augustine didn't say anything, just picking up the expensive bottle, and Hera helped Agatha get the items, and the group walked into the seemingly deserted poetry castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Augustine inserted the crystal into the hidden institution, the floor of the hall passed through a series of dazzling transitions, and finally showed a ladder that seemed to extend infinitely downward. Hera and the girls were all shocked. Augustine sighed softly, knowing this secret, Once someone tries to betray, he will not hesitate to kill her. He will not tell them directly that only the dead can leave the castle. This kind of intimidation has no practical meaning. There are always too many temptations in the world to make people choose to risk their lives to gamble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially in this era of the collapse of faith that God was gradually expelled by the devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am really a pessimist." Augustine walked in front of the team and whispered softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera and fifteen girls were taken to the B2 area on the first floor of the ground floor. The most spacious eastern a5 area has been assigned to the escort horns to reach the Black Swan Lake. "Heyers", so they can only be arranged in the western region, try to separate the distance. God knows that these children who are waiting to be released will get lost when they get into the circle of knights who are strictly forbidden to live. Reese couldn't always stay on the edge of the forbidden zone under Augustine's paintings, waiting for the next unfamiliar prey, which would distract him and hinder his growth rate that even Augustine was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfect state of Ares is to train the body function for 18 hours a day, all the rest of the time to supplement food and sleep, no bit by drop Extra thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was the first warrior that Augustine had seen without faith, and it was such a scorpion that even the faith could not understand everything. Raising his head and looking up at the starry sky all night, he completed the agreement to knock down Gugli Gree, and then went to the night watchers to find Augustine across three lines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin took the two girls carrying Descartes and went on with him. Hera took some things selected by Augustine, all Marseille. The most distant items from the orthodox nobles in the Earl's carriage, such as goose down duvets and small wool hand-woven rugs, were given to the surprised girls. He let the rest of the favorite butler's personal butler Elizabeth settled. He is actually very Make sure she will smother the bedding and the carpet, but Augustine is still used to closing one eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that need to be handed over to the A5 area are the responsibility of Ares, and Augustine never doubts the execution of Ares. At this point, the scorpion even has to It’s more reliable than Elizabeth. At least he won’t reach for a copper plate like Lolly butler, and he won’t spit on him because he has a Caesar coin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Yangjiao Experimental Zone on the 2nd floor of the underground, the members of the horns who have studied a lot of topics day and night immediately gathered in a hall dedicated to the research results, the chief researcher of the workaholic, Miss Yi, and the potential enemy of Elizabeth. Professor Shirley is also present. The former seems to be thinner, but the spirit is rising and the mental appearance is rising. It is not surprising that a group of poor lambs abandoned by the mother of the black sheep, Haiji, thought that the future was embarrassing, but they suddenly found the new shepherd. More reliable than imagined, with the noble scientific spirit of Miss Yi, of course, can regain confidence and fighting spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Shirley, who wears a pair of frameless scholar glasses, has thrown an unscrupulous wink. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin turned a blind eye to this, indicating that two girls with large blood stains placed Descartes on the ground and said, "You should save him first, keep it at least." You can be conscious, you don't need to let him jump around. Otherwise, a healing heresy can destroy the entire horn."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking the last sentence Augustine seems to carelessly scan all the people, adding: "But it is forbidden to conduct any research on him. I don't want any of you or somebody's body to be used as an experiment. There is good news, within the next six months. There will be a large number of high-level living and dark species that will be sent to the horns, and you will be ready to fight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows the way back? ?? Augustine asked after leaving the horn test area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliet looked indifferent, Agatha said, and he seemed to hesitate to speak. Hera smiled and said to the latter: "Agatha's memory is very good, almost unforgettable, and the nuclear capacity is not small, I believe she is A very good arcane seedling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Archon, I can only remember half of the journey." Girl Agatha is alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s a very good result." Augustine admired that although it is not as inhuman as the chief researcher of the shofar, the Iraqi researcher, at least it can be reluctantly Genius ranks, 12 gold coins are quite cost-effective. However, the natural skeptics still give a question to verify the reliability of Agatha's ability. "Do you remember who was the eighth in the second row of the left hand in the hall?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ruling adult, there are only seven people in the second row, five men and two women." Agatha smiled charmingly and covered her mouth and laughed. It was a little stunner. Then she looked at Augustine with a look of admiration and admiration. It is a pair of eye-catching eyes like an emerald, with a hint of natural spoiled voice. It is also very light. "Respected consul, you can rest assured that I have nothing to see here, so there is nothing after going back. Said."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin nodded, it was a beautiful and thoughtful little beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juliet squinted at his docile companion, and the light brown scorpion was full of disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will take you back. Next you will learn about the arcane with Miss Hera. I will also teach you magic and red gamma equestrian as long as you Absorptive capacity is strong enough, I can instill in you the knowledge that ordinary aristocrats can't reach, the power derived from knowledge is a more trustworthy thing than the belief born out of religion.” Augustine laughed, one let him spend money After a little comfort, Agatha made him feel a lot more beautiful. In addition, the trip to Alpha has far exceeded expectations. Although it also brings several potential dangers that have to be followed, it is generally a gain that exceeds the hidden loss. Big cut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two girls with different personalities were sent back to the B2 area. Augustine took Hera to the 3rd floor and sighed: "A family of art is sleek. The nobility, a big family of gorse from the uncompromising, but stubborn like a Sicilian wooden cow, is too contradictory. The only similarity is that as long as we give you enough soil and nutrition, you can become the future. Poetry brother black swan."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which one do you prefer?" Hera asked curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Secret." Augustine smiled, taking Hera through the third floor of the labyrinth of the poem, and came to the study room dedicated to him on the 4th floor. The sleeping Prince Dimit has let Ares move to the edge of the 9th floor God's left eye magic array, which can accelerate his wake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Hera put down his interest, Augustine sat at his desk and looked at the information that Kay gave him, he asked her to give the horns all The attribute information of the personnel, which disappoints Augustine is that the chief research officer gives details that is not as detailed as his assessment of the members of the New Knights, but this is second. After all, there are only a handful of extreme characters in the world. I like to use data to make crazy settings. What really makes Augustine regret is that the determination of several suspicious characters in the horns is particularly unremarkable in the information given by Yi Yi. Augustine frowned: "I don't understand the truth. Or is it because of the maternal brilliance to cover up the facts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
