			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team that confronts the Poetry Castle is a classic match of five armored noble knights, three tulip magicians, and two great arcane artists. Only the sacred empire is rich in the honorary kingdom of high-level wizards, and it is possible to build a luxury handwriting with equal proportion of warriors and mages on a small-scale battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top ten horses are not moving, the five sharp rifles are shining in the sun, and the wizard’s singer-level staff has given birth to magic signs. The white crystal ball or the amethyst block is the core, and the energy veins flow irregularly in the shape of lines, and creak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When can I have such a family?" Augustine felt that the imperial empire had calculated that it would cost about 120,000 to cultivate a private tulip magician. Caesar gold coins, and the big knights need 140,000, and the young knights who seduce half of the attackers add up to fifty or sixty thousand Caesar gold coins, which is why the empire is still dominated by the nobility until today, not civilians can control Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin knows why the alchemists and priests in Elizabeth’s mouth did not appear because they intended to make the Cannons Knights an undead army and put them in the first place. From the cannon fodder of the Poetry Castle to the cannon fodder that attacked the underground castle, and this can effectively disperse the cosmo force, must separate the strength to fight the two lines, and any behind-the-scenes conspirators know that the Augustine "giant" is better than anyone. There are no reliable subordinates that can come in handy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great capitals who hide in a dark corner to watch the drama have begun to regard the Black Swan Lake as an artificial colosseum. The cosmo governor, on the other hand, is a large number of expensive pieces that are constantly being sent to Black Swan Lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Yi and Shirley took the two undead to the back of Augustine, standing alone at the door of the castle of Poetry, but the usual ruling official turned his head: "Transfer the command of 傀儡 to me, then go back, Miss Yu Yi, tell the shofar, please be prepared to make all the soldiers on the ground floor into undead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Professor Yi and Shirley, who are known as the black sheep in the extremes of calmness and liberation, heard the news of this horror, but they all paled, but they turned to the spiral ladder without any resistance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fundamental reason why the Ministry of the Holy Sepulse is far above the remaining 2 courtyards of the Holy See. This gloomy organization will never give a scholastic doctrine. The pedantic priests have a little bit of living space. Almost all members of the sacrament are absolutely subordinate to the three spiritual and power leaders. The execution of the Inquisition is a peak that makes the official institutions of the Holy Empire insurmountable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transitional process of the undead is not complicated. Two units, which can only be regarded as weapons, who treat Augustine as a new sanctioner, walked in front of him, and there is no feeling that the ten people are at least one level higher than them. A number of powerful enemies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If humans do not back down, they will instinctively produce some negative emotions, but they have been drained from the soul and they are fearless unless they are sacred things. They are fearful when they are dark products. This is the advantage of cockroaches, but the disadvantage is the lack of flexibility in living things. This has always been the bottleneck for all taboo spells to tirelessly seek breakthroughs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Augustine’s sensitive identity is sometimes fatal, and the knights and mages have taken the official medal and family crest to make it less than ten thousand After a chance of failure, Augustus is not left with the thorny evidence of a plot to be behind the scenes planner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Riding tramples on Black Swan Lake will cost a little bit of money."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin The whispering ambiguity, the commander specifically asked the horns to set a lot of enamel and ugly elements in their bodies, and the filthy undead rushed forward. No way, just from the last time in the clockwork orange overdraft, this time again It comes with a large conch-class hot spring worth 30,000 Caesar gold coins. However, unlike the clockwork orange, after inserting the Titan longan into a lot of pulse points compared to the crow market, he seems to be arrogant today without relying on epic level. The point where the staff fights against the enemy, the black and red gloves still have two oversized high-purity magic balls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helplessly, he only has a "small" core that only expands to the level of the mid-level magician, and can only play the magic skills below 25. The only thing that can be done hard is to bring these most basic and cheap skills to the most unexpected destructive and aggressive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large area of ​​magical spheres converges over the top of Augustine's head like a hail, and then all of them face each other as Augustine waved his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a common sense of the magician, it is a kind of arrogant skill that looks very spectacular but does not reach the expected penetrating power. Power is widely used to act on the face and focus on the point. The two are more dangerous, obvious, especially for the high-ranking knights who are wearing high anti-magic armor and faithful blessings on the battlefield. The middle and low-order large-area magic can almost achieve perfect immunization. It is the armor and the belief that the special material is carefully crafted to increase the body itself to 1+1=2 instead of the general 1+1<><br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera stood on the top floor of the poetry brother's castle, staring at the gorgeous magic. She noticed that the only difference is that most of the magic rain is not simply straight forward, about three-thirds. The two little magic balls all have a purposeful spiral-shaped rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great knights rushed forward and greeted the two undead souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tulip magician and the great arcane sneer sneered at the skill of their forty level with their respective staffs, responding to the childishness and frivolity of the young wizards in their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Augustin, what do you want to do? Is it a waste of valuable nuclear sputum until it is exhausted? You are really sure that you are in the state of five peaks. I'm fighting face to face?" Hera frowned, clinging to two books and gold crickets, not to miss any details, she is a veteran experienced knight, knowing that a cockroach is crucial to the entry point to the battlefield She can even reverse the battle, and she is unaware that she is already sweating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, most of the magic balls that Augustine carefully controlled the trajectory were destroyed by the magician's numerous lightning chains, and the same area of ​​the Arcane Master's "Glorious Bath" Or assimilation, Hera seems to replace Augustine in the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a two-time master of the Cavaliers and Magic, the main double professional masters who broke the 10th level, Hera-Boer Sefele could probably challenge one alone. The combination of the tulip magician and the big knight, the key is to see if the other party's cooperation is familiar, her approximate winning percentage is about 60%, after all, there is very little perfect partner on the temporary battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great knight, one shot at a time, almost pierced the undead, and provoked the end of the gun to prepare two unclean dirty species to Augustine, but found their hands The rifle was smothered, even though the body was stabbed a transparent one, and the two legs were moved backwards by a long inertial gun. Two deep marks were drawn on the ground, and they were still stubbornly nailed to the ground. The power of the top 9th-order cockroaches, ignoring the pain, the physical strengthening to the metamorphosis of the barbaric orcs of the Muse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the sects fight against all the dark species, the weapons will take the cathedral to accept at least the bishop-level priests "baptism" and "blessings", but behind these knights The owner didn't expect Augustine to move out of the two undead shackles, so the rifle was suddenly infected by the ruthenium and ugly elements inside the body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two things are the opposite of the nature of God. They are born to be the darling of the heretical wizard. Lolita’s “Vatican Office” has a game that uses these two things to create a pool, and then let the knights and priests throw in After the "pollution", the knights and priests will not be purified by the Holy See for the rest of their lives, unless there are the great churches above the Archbishop who are willing to pity them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two undead scorpions broke out with great strength, and they broke the two long guns and then rushed forward with the gun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two great knights are not afraid, taking out the ivory knight sword like Descartes, ready to cut their heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin still does not know how to burn a lot of magical rain with the Master. The only result is that some sporadic magic balls are on the Cavaliers' high anti-magic armor, but only for The Cavaliers are completely negligible, except that one person will puncture the magic ball with a long gun. Two of them are too lazy to move, let the magic ball hit the armor and blow up a small spark to reflect them and the wizards. Very different physical qualities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three tulip magicians seem to be impatient with these small fights, each brewing a 50-level + magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin gently swallowed a small hot spring, from the beginning to the end did not pay attention to the entanglement of the honorary knight and the undead, gently looked up to the top floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is always thinking about throwing the Holy See or the Golden Hera with intuition, and finally chose the latter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she threw this little Elizabeth’s carefully collected little guy to the battlefield, Augustine slammed a bunch of spells and finally shouted two words, “ Advent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden enamel of less than ten centimeters blooms in the air like a sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A behemoth slammed on the battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 meters high, like the Satan of the heresy cult, has two huge golden yellow corners, and the black flame burns in it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
