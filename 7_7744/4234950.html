			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Holy See really stipulates that the priests weighing more than 200 pounds are pigs that should be slaughtered, the Archbishop of Rama of the Macka Cathedral can sell almost two pork. Money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And such a fat pig who is struggling to go to bed, in the recommendation book of the bishop of the Vatican’s Vatican, is similar to a little bit of defensive doctrine,"媲美脉代代奥拉神学院, the wit of the monk's wit pride, and the "poor bishop" touching comments, Augustine throws the sentence after the classic sentence that spread throughout the city of Judit, the second sentence is more slick, "Ram Archbishop, when accepting the verbal remorse of the ladies, they took off your large robe and went down to find the bird you are hiding in a lot of fat?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The heresy, the madman, the sorcerer. Grab it and throw it at the Warden Warden." Archbishop Ram was furious. In Maka's pampering, he was originally a lord who ruled a rich land. Later he listened to the advice of the uncle of the Red Archbishop and became the priest of the Macka Cathedral. In just ten years, he became the mind of Maca, climbing speed. Like the uncle's first-line aristocratic children, in his uncle's words, if you abandon the superficial material wealth, you can become a wit shepherd, so that is the wealthiest man of Matt, whether it is spiritual or territorial and gold coins. In fact, this nephew has the same talent in conquering women, becoming the public lover after the number of people in the Earl of Heber. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I still throw me into the Ministry of the Holy See." Augustine laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Ministry of the Sacred?" Archbishop Ram frowned. In fact, he began to look at the uninvited guests very early, a young priest of a magician, one A small loli who can sell a lot of money to the nobles of the emperor, a beautiful lady who is sinful, needs him to use the flesh to redeem, and three mysterious characters shrouded in robes, vaguely undead, Dark undead? Who in the County of Maso County has the courage to rush into the Cathedral of Marka with a flashy servant? Hey, this group of people is really just right. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private Ram is very appreciative of the provocation of the young priest, looking for a bird in the fat? What a vivid metaphor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I heard that Archbishop Lahm and Deputy Chief Executive Debussy signed a grant to the Mississippi Underground Arena, but now Mississippi has happened a little. Trouble, isn’t there any concern about the Archbishop Ram, who has successfully jumped into the central system of the Holy See from the local area? Do not dare to go to the city of Judah without cleaning his ass?” Augustin sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Quentin’s dark gold dagger, Lusi’s sickle, is still on the neck of the middle-aged bishop. There are a large number of no-name knights who are dying in the Macka Cathedral. There is no fighting power at all. It’s just a bunch of Vases are not considered inferior pots, otherwise Mrs. Quentin can never hold the bishop so easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you mean?" Archbishop Lahm waved his hand and drove the knights out to shut the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine was a little surprised by the strength of this fat pig, and also indicated that Mrs. Quentin had let go of the bishop. This is the standard posture of aristocratic negotiations. Augustine misses this. The scene, during the three years of the night watchman organization, there is very little chance of sitting down and chatting with heresy or dark species, all directly killing, like two beasts thrown into the arena, otherwise Augustine is not the executioner. The little butcher is a young version of the Teutonic giant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I met with your uncle and talked about it." Augustine took several backups from the Sardinian Doctrine, both with Archbishop Lahm and Mississippi, there is the contribution of Mrs. Fiona, and the remorse of the Louis Housekeeper. In short, it is a sensitive thing that can be dragged to the Holy See’s Ministry of Information. The only difference is in who’s hands, because of these things. If in the hands of a civilian, there are 10,000 copies that are not handed over to the Ministry of Information. Are the people of the Empire equal? Every few years, there are always one or two radical thinkers who like to shout slogans are invited to the Ministry of the Holy See, brainwashed, and the "lucky" of the family * can still guarantee a small life to work hard for the theoretical research office of the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice. Most of them without * are tortured into madmen who are uncompromising. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ram did not pick up the information, his brain is very good, far more flexible than his bloated body, he has done great achievements in his own years, remember Clearly, he was not curious about the documents in the hands of the young man. He was curious about the extent to which the young man had his intersection with his uncle. His uncle, although he was in the Vatican, was a relatively weak red power. Archbishop, but within the sacred empire, no nobles can ignore the right to speak of an archbishop of red, the Archbishop of Red, who is far more prominent than a county governor. There is such an uncle, who has always been Ram. The greatest gratitude to God in prayer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obese archbishop is not looking at the young priest of unknown origin, trying to find clues from the mask of the nobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't guess, who you don't want to see the most, who is the least likely to be here, who I am." Augustine laughed and slammed the information. On the table, the candlelight shook. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
