			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she got up in the morning, she walked on the Witch Street and then returned to the bookstore along the river, shouting Miss Zusili from the bed, eating breakfast, troika Sailed to the Black Swan Lake, the Guizhi crown, which was pulled by the Holstein heavy-duty horse, was helpless. Because he didn't know the road, he could only eat dust behind the gold balance badge. Uz obviously cherished the coexistence with the distant cousin. Time, leaving the carriage that belonged to him, squeezed into the narrow carriage of Augustine, talked a lot of topics in the field of theology and art, for the family under the centaur badge, just a touch of light, the father of Us is an Austrian The Earl of the Frontier of the Gujarat Empire, this is the symbol of the power of the first power in the Western Continent. The five kings of the royal family, "Brandenburg" and "Andersen", were fixed on the territory of the royal power for the rest of their lives. The earliest borders of Gugga, the hands of the frontiers, are the masters who really control the mouthpieces of the empire and the swords and spears. The outside world’s criticism of the sacred empire, apart from religious hostility, is largely a ridicule. This kingdom is not The descendants of the sect can obtain the "generousness" of the nobility title. In the past, the magician could step into the elite class. Now even the profits of the merchants are included in the empire's honor. This is too absurd, and there is no closure. It is no wonder that the white sage always taunts the sacred. The nobles of the empire are too cheap and the bloodlines are too impure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three carriages stopped at the edge of the Black Swan Lake. The lady and Us also saw the stone at the same time, but the lady was more careful and saw behind her. The inscription, as for the thick line of Miss Zusili, was protesting why she could not comfortably ride in the carriage and enter the manor. She saw her wife kneeling on the back of the stone tablet and went over to ask what was engraved on the head. The lady uttered it silently, Zusili The lady immediately put Augustin in hell into the next hell, and only the insanely talented people would be interested in the book The Wealth of Nations. As for the "The Wealth of Nations", it is still mixed. The economics written by the civilians who have fallen from poverty to hunger and cold are praised as "the second Bible" by the "golden worshippers", but they are conservative. The orthodox aristocracy unanimously devalued the devil's proverb. Only with the strong rise of the sacred empire, some highly self-study scholastic scholars had to go through a really in-depth reading of this thin booklet that was not on the shelf. The episodes caused by stone tablets and inscriptions quickly calmed down. The pedestrians walked on the marble road painted with sable flowers. On both sides were tall and lush Quebec sugar maples and sycamores, which were dotted with twelve zodiac magic. The array of eyes is not an in-depth exploration of the dark magic, only the exquisite sculptures as a full-faced artwork, Zusili is very interested in the statue of the Virgin with a water bottle, ran to wash the face With a slender heel, he tried to reach out and block the mouth of the water bottle that was constantly flowing out of the spring, but he was splashed by the water and laughed at himself. Uz is standing under the statue of the twins and thinking about humanity. There are only Augustine and the quiet lady in the shade. The lady smiles and says: "The words behind the stone tablet are born out of the famous "three" in The Wealth of Nations. Things can make any kingdom great—belief, steel and gold coins'? I hope to ask this, without the offender, you can write a beautiful font of the Grand Executive.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine's hands crossed a triangle and stated: "Faith is the source that supports the empire in the midst of suffering. Steel is the premise of the military, and gold coins are the last cornerstone of the war. These three constitute a complete triangle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady recognized this statement: "In mathematics, the triangle is the most stable structure. I only roughly read the "The Wealth of Nations" once again, there are too many professions The term makes me a headache, but the emotional arguments and poetic words that occasionally come out make me insist on seeing the end. It seems that I need to read it again and again, I believe that a book that can be enjoyed by the big executives is worth Chewing and pondering."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin reached for a green maple leaf on his head and gave it to his wife, smiling: "I hope this maple leaf will be honored to be the "Guo Fu" On the bookmarks in the book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady took over the emerald green Quebec sugar maple leaves, the corners of the mouth, "I am honored to have received the Grand Executive gift I hope that if you are invited to drink tea by the Ministry of the Ministry of the Future, this maple leaf can bring the right of pardon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looked serious: "Who dares to ask the lady to go When the sacrament was drinking tea, I asked him to go to the sacrament to drink tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady joked: "It seems that I will wait until the poetry castle, I It is the black tea that can't drink the big executive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stunned, silent, no aristocratic accent from the Rotong Chald family Deal with this small problem that should have been answered very well. The lady looked up at the maple leaf in a timely manner, then quietly turned back to the line of sight, observing the owner of the Black Swan Lake around her. A trace of sunshine passed through the gap between the leaves and shone on the young man. His face was a little tired and pale, his eyes were clear, and When people talk, they habitually look at other people's eyes, not the chest of the old nobles. His body is slender, not weak, not strong, very moderate, can be a priest, can be a knight, when he is silent, the meager lips will linger. It adds a sharp sharpness to the soft facial contours. It does not wear a badge on the body. It is a piece of aster flower pattern at the foot. It is not a bright flower that blooms, only a tender flower bud and flower bud. When he picked the maple leaf just now, as he pushed the "Apologetics" to her in front of him, he noticed his hands and fingers. It is very suitable for playing the piano and taking the quill. The nails are trimmed very flat, unlike Some aristocrats with bad tastes are used to keeping their little fingernails long, obviously can't afford spears, can't go to the battlefield, but like to use this deformity to insult women in bed. The man in front of him, whether it is the inexhaustible conversation or the details of every movement, is invulnerable. It is inconsistent with the portraits of the traitors and descendants depicted in the minds of his wife who came to Maso County. In memory, Prince Schopenhauer will only be in her. In front of the battle on the red Gogol plain, it was apparently evasive of the sacrifice of Rheinhatten, and the Napoleon priest, who was recognized as an imperial hero, was the same as her conversations about teaching and navigation. Some will leave a haze in the lady's heart, but the man around him, when he sent a pot of gardenia, smashed the "Ideological Reed" of the enemy. The lady thought: What is the young giant standing under the maple leaf and the sycamore leaf? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine knew that the lady was observing herself, but was willing to accept this harsh examination. Before leaving Alpha City, the Earl of Marseille had been secretly investigated the source of the black pearl necklace. I believe that such a precious collection is not difficult to be known about the true identity of the owner. . Miss Zusili played enough spring water, Uz also returned from the Gemini statue, Augustine led them to the image of the Madonna, pressed the crystal, showing the spiral staircase, do not mind bringing them into the underground world of the poetry castle, this It is the minimum sincerity. I can't leave them with a circle in the manor. I am afraid that in addition to my wife, the old antiques of Fermoth and Constant will have to slap the idiots and embarrassment of this relative. The lady saw the huge Ursula tree eye and exclaimed: "The ancient tree of life?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the "daughter" wandering and patrol poetry songs The little queen met the group of face-faced guests, crossed her arms, holding a rope in her hand, and wrapped it around the neck of the golden double-headed scorpion. Obviously, the poor ninth-order little guy preferred some "father" Augustine. The violent and not gentle mother, some sad despair, every time she breaks off the reins and hides in a small corner, she will be found by her and re-attached the rope of no honor. Miss Zusili saw this delicate and lovely little loli, like the Princess of the Golden Sparrow, and immediately ran over and pinched her face. Augustine was afraid that her butler would accidentally make Miss Zusili a doll, but Soon, I was relieved, because all the flat-chested women could become friends of Miss Elizabeth. Although she was pinched and made her feel a little uncomfortable, her hands were not idle, and she licked Zusili’s chest. After confirming that it is not great, revealing a naive smile behind the sincerity, holding the hand of Zusili, whispering, Augustine lost the eyes of the individual to do something, and after receiving the response, no longer worry, Loli The housekeeper climbed the fence with Miss Zusili and climbed the ancient tree of life. It can be seen that the adventurous Miss Zusili is not very elegant in climbing posture, but full of sincere excitement, probably returning to Bai Weiwei. The golden family has more of the capital that she has shown off to her father and elders. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I was young, Miss Zusili, who was not afraid of heights, was very good at sending, followed by the little queen to conquer the ancient tree of Ursula, and Us was similar. The song just released a document to attract, this is the masterpiece of the deputy order leader One Eye Long Ulisse, used as a basic intelligence assessment, a total of 150 questions, 150, almost covers all areas, needs Divergent and reverse thinking, meticulous and powerful logical reasoning, can get high scores. In the poems, Ms. Yi Yi only got the high scores of breaking 100 in the specified time, and only studied the profound Shirley and gold in the professional field. The assistant professor was not even qualified, and the more knowledgeable Hall got more than 90 points. This made Ulyssey, who had a superior sense of intelligence to Augustine, regret it, until Lolita’s housekeeper lost a singularly The answer sheet is a full score of terror, and at the end is a testimony full of anger: the author can go to death, it is purely a waste of time to read "flowers and blood", can watch twelve lines in half an hour! Your intelligence is equal to the idiot's big idiot! Please honestly answer the great Queen Elizabeth, is your brain full of straw? Still straw? Still straw? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, members of the poetry songs can often see a funny scene: the tall single-tailed sub-order, Ulysses, followed the little queen holding a "snake" and bent over to ask some professional questions, most of the time. The little queen was too lazy to answer, and occasionally she was in a good mood, only to respond to the question of the deputy order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is very clear about the depth of the wisdom of the two, located in the same plane, so should be able to become a friend who can speak, is the kind that one wants to The other person’s head collects a good friend who wants to turn the other person into a dead soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uss was busy answering questions, Augustine had to bring his wife to the library on the first floor of the tulip that had been emptied. There were not many books, and there was a special corner. The bookshelf of a fat essay is not open to the public. Augustine has often sat here to continue to write "Second Empire" involving the marine military prototype. Only this quiet time that no one disturbs can let Augustine not think about those. It is destined to be a difficult problem that cannot be solved temporarily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have only seen the plains in their lifetime, naturally they will not try to turn over the peaks that they have never seen before. These people are happy, some people, I have seen the mountains, but I am very optimistic that I can’t climb, and I can see the scenery similar to the top of the mountain at the foot of the mountain. These people are also happy. Unfortunately, Augustine is a pessimist with obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is a peak, and there are stretches of mountains, there are academic institutions, there are higher than the Academic Affairs of the Vatican, there are empire, there are those aristocratic classes standing in the foothills of the Empire, there is the temple of the Muse ancestors who just joined There is a ruined horn that prevents the Duke of Maja Black Sheep from reaching the top of St. Urban, and several higher peaks shrouded in the clouds. Augustine certainly wants to rest, but even if he does not look up, he knows that the existence of those mountains is always possible. It’s rolling over, now, the order is like his body, and he is seriously ill: St. Urban, who came down from God, has returned to the original plane, and the holy armor is completely broken like the robes that the godfather sewed, Old Clough’s The letter indicates that the Holy See is finally beginning to deprive him of his "teaching" interpreter. The deepest secret is that Augustine's life hourglass still passes at several times, and he does not even dare to tell the disaster that he is sad enough. Li Guan, but the future is not the absolute darkness of suffocation, this is the optimism of Augustine's pessimism: Ulysse is still very stable at present, is a qualified kingdom manager. The ancient tree of life does exist as a possibility to open the key to the Gothic water cup. The tentacles of the gold balance began to penetrate the boundaries outside of Maso County, and the lambs that were stocked were thriving, and each one began to become an independent predator. Prince Dimit is expected to be the youngest ancestor in the history of the Setters family, and this does not require Augustine to wait too long. The most important thing is that Augustine is still alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady did not happen to pick a draft of Augustine's continued writing of "The Second Empire." When she first saw the first page, the wife immediately put down the draft and apologized: "I will keep it secret, promised never read this draft, please Believe me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shook his head: "It doesn't matter, it was originally a banned book that would not be published for decades. If the lady is interested in reading, I I am glad that the number of readers has increased from one to two."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady sitting next to Augustine manages her hair, she leans her head when reading, she Looked very carefully, the body exudes a natural fragrance, she is reading, Augustine is watching her, eyes can not be hot, do not dare to scorn. She carefully read the forty-page manuscripts bound into a book. It was just a roll. It was probably a vocabulary with too many partial doors. Sometimes it would frown. This kind of obstacle affecting the progress of reading has not been appreciated by her. She has always believed. Good works are not piled up by arrogant sophistry and pretentious words, but she does not hold a literary work in her hand, so it does not affect her love of this volume, especially those who discern it at a glance. Out of the beautiful font from the owl feather pen, full of rigorous wisdom, the court literati friends she knows, often thinking magnificent, but disdain the details of the scrutiny, that is the superficial performance of talent, and those philosophers Going to the other extreme, it seems that every pronunciation or every character is trying to be standardized. She had mistakenly thought that the Napoleon priest, who wrote the travel diary "A Thought Reed," was the only exception. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. blinked and said: "Augustin, I am your loyal new reader. Compared to the sequel to "A Thought Reed," I am even more Look forward to this manuscript."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine was a little surprised: "Mr. are you interested in sailing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Mrs. shook her head: "On the contrary, I am full of fear of sailing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine smiled: "I feel very honored. The next time I write, I will be even more embarrassed." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady hesitated for a moment, more and more like a reader, curious about the author’s inner world, for the first time asked in a careful tone: "Augustin, with you Aphrodite, born in Augsburg, was your lover?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stunned and denied: "Of course not, just with this The North Ouwufu family celebrity met once in a fox hunting in a family estate. Of course, Miss Aphrodite at that age, .. & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp only by a very touching for me, the most beautiful autumn maple leaf or "<br <br /> & nbsp />;The lady glanced at Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this a play? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine is very calm, self-deprecating: "Mrs, are you a loyal reader to treat sincere authors?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady did not see panic and frivolity from his eyes, smiled, "forgive my new readers for prejudice and misunderstanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Augustine laughed: "You have prejudice, but there is no misunderstanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ladies gently grasp the manuscript with his hands, his face is reddish and the style is blooming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin explained: "Like I see the gardenia growing in the wild, it is beautiful, swaying, I will appreciate, but I will never I will pull it out and plant it in the garden."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady squinted her head and looked at the sincere Augustine, the curvature of the corner of the mouth was very beautiful, soft "So what about ancient trees? Is it because it is not beautiful enough to be planted in your garden by the Grand Executive?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin had a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Quietly waiting for the answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin had to glance at her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. was amused by Augustine’s action. No one dared to marry her in the past, even the man who was hailed as the most masculine and romantic feeling of the empire. But his age is a little bigger for her, and she doesn't allow herself to be someone's canary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere here is a little subtle, but Miss Zusili jumped up and down on the ancient tree of Ursula, and almost fell from the branches several times. Into the bottom of the tomb became a mud wearing a luxurious costume, followed by her rushing to pull her fallen body clock tower geeks continue to meditate a sentence, "Miss, my mother said, do not stand high, whether moral Architecture is still a geographical location," Miss Zusili is too lazy to teach Quasimodo "you are an orphan" and play crazy. Since Augustine took the lead in expressing sincerity, Uz also expressed his sincerity and did not bring the two shackles into the underground castle of the poetry song. At this time, he was doing the test, and when he was half done, he kept looking down at the Uist eyes. He changed the color, it was hidden, and he changed his hand to the left hand with his right hand. I don't know when Ulysse, standing behind the Conrad's ordinary heir, slowly said: "The guest of the Centaur badge, you are very interesting, suffering from serious mental illness, need me to help you drive away the weak oneself? ?From split to complete?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uss, who is easily solving the last theological problem, did not look up, with a smile: "No, it's fun now, even your master, the clever Augustine cousin was deceived by my acting."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Augustin is not my master, I just help him take care of this little kingdom." Ulyssey narrowed his eyes, "schizophrenia, is the dragon against the Constance Dragon Slayer The punishment is to curse the family to go to self-destruction in madness. As far as I know, this curse that brings both bad luck and power has been lifted in previous generations. From this point of view, your family needs a strong one. To the thrilling heir, just like the aster flower needs Augustine, the little guy, if you tell me what kind of misfortune brings your birth, I will not tell Augustin this secret."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you go to the whistle, I can finish this question, and then let you disappear. Ulysse, you are only the king of truth, not the master of the power country." Us is calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't accept threats." Ulysses laughed and snorted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is the threat, it is a very kind reminder. The wise man who gave such a wonderful questionnaire can of course be my half friend." Us Looking up, it is a pair of eyes that have lost pupils. "I introduce myself, I am the soul master of the coward who gave a light love sister and a heavy love-mother plot. You can call me Turing, I guess you call it The misfortunes probably mean that I will teach Uz's biological mother and two sisters to become female slaves who will only crawl, or will we cast our common Earl's father?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Ulisse’s laughter in his throat is like a crow singing in the open, too interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This neuropathy slowly stood up and handed the second full score to Ulyssey, smiling: "This time I brought to my dear Augustin cousin. A pair of armor, which has the essence taken from the black dragon Dandong bones, could have become the most wonderful cage, experienced countless taboo pleasures, but this cousin is too cautious, I am very happy, finally met a good The opponent, whether intellectual or power, the only thing that is lacking is that Augustine seems to have suffered a little injury. This makes my cousin very sad. What is more painful is that he can refuse the temptation of Constant's owner. It is amazing. On several occasions, I couldn’t help but show up and praise his wisdom. Right, Ulysses, I have seen your Dead Sea Instrument, which is the only reason I am willing to come out to see you. I have always been very friendly in the standing position."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
