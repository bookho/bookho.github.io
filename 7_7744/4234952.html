			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaca wonderful looking down at the "Golden Rectangle" which is the basics of magic entry for her, which is mixed with the old magician who portrayed Parker Ketchi counts the magic parchment of parchment. She often swears that witches and Augustine are not sneaking into the study to read taboo books. She has a solid foundation and her contact with the top magical array is comparable to an imperial magician, facing this first look. The strange and interesting parchment magical array was attracted because it seemed to have obvious eye-deficient defects. When she was asking for an inquiry, Augustine had already handed her a quill, and she gently outlined it one by one. After finding out a defect, she patiently explained to Augustine around her. Unexpectedly, she not only found out seven magical flaws, but also seemed to find a place that was said to involve the improvement of the earth's vein nodes. Augustine was confused. Can't keep up with the esoteric terminology of Gaga, but Augustine is sure that this is the same as Fibonacci's Magic and Digital Segmentation. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Master Augustine next to Gaka is not sounding, she frowns and thinks that her own story is not clear enough, she thinks a little, and puts all the clues in her mind. Once again, he asked him for a beautiful paper with a scented scented badge, and he did not lift his head on the stationery to portray a perfect version of her magical genre, and said: "The earth." The context is a secret field that is not covered by the epic mainland magic union. I also learned a little shallow theory through the books of your teacher. The earth magic has a famous saying. Give me a lever and a fulcrum to pick up the whole. On the epic continent, I think this mysterious fulcrum that has not yet been cracked is the earth's circumstance. It involves too much coverage and coverage. In my opinion, only your unknowingly unknown teacher has a deep understanding of this dark field. In the vast field of magic, ninety-nine out of a hundred magicians have chosen to intensively work on a branch, and only this one heresy needs Terror of talent and luck to get lucky enough to become a master of "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; finally unfinished, sigh. Gaka raised her head and saw that Augustine had not looked at the stationery in her hand, but her face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaca suddenly remembered the words of the Duchess. Men's careers are on swords and spears, on horseback, and their hobbies are in the wine glasses, on the woman's face and belly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that his eyes are hot, but it’s more like his father’s appreciation of a work of art. It’s not unusual for young aristocrats to want her to fall immediately. For all the clothes, yin秽亵渎, for the latter, Gaga is never to show her amazing magic talent, even in the Ola. At this time, the seminary had two unlucky insects that were burnt into charcoal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine took the parchment in her hand and the improved version of the magical letter paper, and smiled: "Gaga wonderful, you have helped me a lot, let me, how can I thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaga Mia did not pretend to be artificial, smiled and said: "The books that left you in Luo Tongchaid have been borrowed from me for a few years, up to ten years. After ten years, I must be still intact. For you, there is no guarantee and no more than one page."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin remembered that the witch said that it is best not to let the girl touch too much of this "taboo magic", shaking his head Road: "This can't be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaca wonderfully said: "Master Augustine, those books are already in the city of Tamei."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Augustine’s surprised expression, the conspiracy of Gaga’s eyes smiled and said: “I sang a good lie with the Duchess and said to me. I will help you bring these books to the city of Tamay, so that you can read them. Although I know that the Duchess knows my little tricks, she does not seem to debunk. The meaning, so Master Augustine, you should not try to ship these books back to Augsburg."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agristing and laughing, gently patted this darling girl Delicate and delicate face. It’s like a rose with a slight bloom, like a morning dew, with a sultry scent, and Augustine is a little bit awkward, but looks at himself, saying: “I’m not willing to let you touch. It's easy to send you the books of the heresy ruling, but my guide has said that these magical knowledge that you can't master is like a flood of beasts, which may engulf you or lead you to a heresy. s Otherwise, it would be fine if you give it to you. Gaga is wonderful. I am not a person who is jealous of friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaca wonderful face, back to face Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graceful and graceful curvature of the body is like a slight bow, and some temptations seem to carry an unknown danger that Augustine first discovered. When she turned around and sat next to Augustine, she was as beautiful as a porcelain face. But I changed my face and looked innocently. There was also a blush that had never completely faded, and she stared at Augustine. Dao: "Do you know, Master Augustine, you are always a mentally handicapped in my eyes, you have no unforgettable skills, no nuclear stunned by the old magicians like me, for me, not my smart People are idiots. I say that you will be angry with Master Augustine, who has the first heir to the Rotongschild family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman’s mind is as deep as the magical world. Even the most embarrassing politicians can’t guess the true thoughts of women. Augustine has been wary of Gakamiao for these years. He knows very well that the respectfulness of Gaga's appearance on the surface of the Duke's House is largely due to the submission of Rotongschild, not to his personal fear. So he shook his head and said, "No, I am very glad that you are telling the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaga's wonderful eyes to play with the taste: "Master Augustine, you have no need to rape me. **? Do some nobles like to rudely possess a woman who can't conquer with IQ? Like my brother in the family of Tamay, I like to do this for some civilian girls."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled and said: "Don't seduce me to be a nobleman who has lost the gentleman's coat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaca Wonderful grace got up, and when I walked to the door, I turned to stare at Augustine, saying: "Augustin, when you leave the city of Augsburg to the Ola, the fat child is full of childish childish worship and shows me how to teach him. Those traps, I used water magic to betray this one in the past two The fat pig between the secret alliances was frozen into ice sculptures. At that moment, I suddenly found the power to make myself pursue the ultimate magical magic. Before that, I was just satisfying the vain vanity of my family."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled and said something she said to her when she was young. "Please call me Master Augustine later."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Gaga made a noble ceremony. Then leave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the building stood two teenagers, black and black, with a trace of fire, York and Nero. For the Ola, which is rarely seen in the female xing creatures, a young beauty like Jakamiao is undoubtedly the biggest seduce of taboo and temptation in the adolescence of Nero and York. The weak and weak aristocratic ladies climbed for a few hours, and finally went to the top of Shifeng with all their hardships. They saw that both eyes were staring at the stunned little monk who was watching it. She was in a bad mood. Give this pair of teenagers a dazzling fireball dance, the whole pulse of Ola peaks suddenly bright, then there are two dull teenagers who are dark as charcoal, more powerful is a sweet smile of Gaga from Nie In the mouth of the mouth, ask about the detailed residence of Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out of the buildings of Augustine at the moment. Nile with a charming face and a tight face, York is still at the door, and sees Gaga's magic immediately greet him. It can be seen that the sleek guy of York's magical spell is facing the beauty of the tower. However, it was a battle, and Nero was a very thick face, and he said with diligence: "Mr. Gaga Miao, is it going to leave Oula so soon? In fact, we have a special residence for visitors."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gakamiao did not take care of the aristocratic master of the Pompey family. Even more lazy to look at the black, more like a piece of wood, York, directly to the stone seam exit down the mountain, several family knights waiting for aside. At this time, the veterans of the Ola, including the teacher of York, also came out to send them. These old men must have been extremely interested in the talented woman of Gaga, who is also a genius woman in the first line of York. The main monastery of the Upper Von Ola is also an appreciation attitude, as the lowest number of visits by the nobility in the ten major monasteries of the Empire, not to mention the female xing who is common to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disregarding this group of old people and two fool-like teenagers, they sneaked into the cracks of the stone, and hated this difficult road, Gaka wonderfully said: "Total One day, I will blow up this damn pulse, Ola."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if the Archbishop of Red Hat Ieta heard this sentence would be simple Be a childish joke. Still feel a horrible creep. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dusk, the team at the foot of the Ola pinnacle belonging to the Gaga Miao family finally left slowly, and Augustine sat on the branch of the Ironbow, shaking The ankles look out over the plains of the distance and are refreshing. Nero carefully climbed to the side of Augustine to sit down. He was actually a person with fear of heights, and told Augustine that every time he stood in the high subconscious, he would jump down and move, so if there is no time for him. The figure of Augustine may not be strange at all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero cares about Augustine and looks at him, laughing: "It’s a beautiful noble lady. You say, Augustine?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin squinted at Nero, who had a barbecued cigarette smell, and smiled: "If you want to trick her into a big bed of your Pompeii family, I advise You dispel this thought because she will burn all the big beds of your entire family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero wiped his face. I patted the dust on my body. Sighed: "I have already taught, Augustine. I heard that your family of Luo Tong's neighbors likes to have some freaks, and it really is not fake."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustine did not pay attention to it. At present, he is not associated with the "freak", from the mediocre ordinary heirs in the eyes of Augsburg, to the present devout priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She likes you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero suddenly opened his mouth to reveal a signature sunny smile, staring at the calm face of Augustine, the teenager who can almost count the level of Jupiter City's son-in-law, there is no trace of embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shook his head and smiled: "She just said that I am mentally retarded. I also know that she has been eager to freeze me into ice sculptures and roast pigs like you. So your idea is very imaginative, and it really is the guy who wants to be a bard in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero looks to the red agate plain, whisper: "When she first arrived at the peak of the Ola, she was covered in gray soil, and her hands were cut off. I arranged it for half an hour outside our house. Then I went in to see you. To be honest, I was still very angry. The aunt of the little aristocratic girl can see her sincere devotion and completely dispelled my revenge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin whispered, no What to express. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a civilian like York. Even if an IQ can't surpass Gaga's "mentality," he is the master of the future Imperial Aster. It is a disciple of St. Ermies, the son of Ida, the archbishop of Red, so he would not easily admire the celebrity skirt of a lady in the beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bottom of my heart is finally touched by a touch of faintness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin softly said: "Maybe this girl knows that in the rose garden, the most stinging rose is the most difficult to pick. No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nero laughs: "You are more suitable than me to be a bard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustin shakes his head and whispers: "Nero, I sincerely advise you as the other godfather of the godfather, the greatest bard, St. Paula, once said: Our songs are not enough to entertain God. Augustine learned that the old man in Room 2 of the Confession was the great theologian and the great heresy of the Vatican, but the one that interests him the most is another identity of the confessor. The former curator of the Vatican Titan Library and the revision of the rules governing the management of magic books, Augustine came to the old man’s room with the parchment of the Pokélé’s magical array, and the old man with a dry face had an unusually tall figure. There wasn't even a book or magic book in the room. He didn't show any resentment or enthusiasm for the visit of the young priest. He asked: "Father, do you have something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Augustine respectfully said: "I have a rudimentary magical array here. I would like to ask you a few questions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heirs selected by Iyta are so good to learn Q, the old man's face and a few points, he also knows that in the next few years Ieta will write a book called "Teaching", so the adventure of Augustine did not care too much, and then say a priest who is enthusiastic about power. I am certainly not willing to spend a quarter of an hour with his great heresy of Vatican. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man took the parchment and was slightly surprised. "This is an interesting magical array. It cleverly uses the sacred proportions. These seven sketches The fallacy must be deliberate, oh? This eighth is a bit interesting. I take a closer look, priest, if you are not in a hurry, you can sit down first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a full day, Augustine moved the "Golden Rectangles" and "Three Sacred Proportions in the Field of Magic" on the proposal of the old man. Finally, even the "Fiberna Magic and Digital Segmentation Ultimate" on the third floor of the library was borrowed. When he came out, the old man was not the old curator of the Holy See. His explanation was far more profound than that of the Gaga. The old man patiently explained his explanation to point out a paragraph in several books, which made Augustine quickly understand this. The general framework of several books, although he does not have the magical talent of Gaga, does not prevent him from bypassing. For learning, he never walks. In the end, not only the nine shortcomings were all outlined, but the old curator also told him a lot of taboo knowledge about the imaginary nodes of the earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child who was satisfied with leaving the confessional room was not a strong back, and the old curator nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the appointed time, the old magic of Room 6 saw the letterhead bearing the Rothschild’s badge. For a moment. It seems that the sable flower badge and the magical array above it make him feel awkward. He put on his glasses and carefully studied this magical array filled with argument formulas and complex principles by Augustine. Frequently nodding, for the eighth unexpected flaw is even more shocking to the elderly, during which he casually asked Augustine some questions can also answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man took off his glasses and smiled and said: "Child, I don't care how you get this result today, because I am an old man who cares only about the results. Ok, priest, me. Admit your identity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled and said: "I know you don't need to confess, so I want to ask, you have not been accepted by the magic union. Magical array?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
