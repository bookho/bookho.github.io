			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby in the shackles, hard and fortunately passed the most vulnerable stage, got out of the cradle, learned to walk, and started running. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the order, the most independent body of the Vatican's Holy See ministry with a gold balance badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin sits in a dimly lit study and counts his wealth on paper: three laboratories in the horn, in addition to more than seventy researchers, plus most The number of the first ones is about one hundred. With the help of Miss Yi Yi, the nails of the mother of several black sheep inserted in the horns were pulled out and became the anatomical objects on the laboratory table. It is now a very clean horn. This is a secret game between Augustine and Haiji. The order is won in a less glorious way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 65 mature knights of the Kraft family can be put into any battlefield for the first time. As for the Knights of the Hundreds who were chosen by the order of the Lolita slave market, it is a good coolie, but that's it. For this group, there is butter and bread, and there is a place to live. Don't worry that one day the slave owner will sell it to a nobleman who likes to whip the body. After the Grand Knight Hera left, the girl’s regiment did not expand in size and lacked the mysterious intuition of Miss Hera. Augustine was not willing to waste a copper plate to feed a group of girls who were not qualified for cannon fodder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closest to the Holy Gate of the Dead Sea Knight Descartes, behind it is nearly a hundred skeletons and undead knights. The loyalist Ted, who was nurtured by the horns, has been close to scrapping because of his arrival in the poem. He has no possibility of becoming a hell of the king, but has the opportunity to become the hell of the dark knight. This is an acceptable good. Message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dimit in the cemetery, slowly advancing to the servant of the true ancestors, is Augustin's most important card. The two dormant long-haired marquis have little meaning, but the two families behind them, Gand Hughes and Marshall, are willing to accept the invitation of order. This information is crucial. Especially the Prince Quinn of the Gandhi Hughes family is just one of the two founders of the poetry song underground world. Augustine has too many small questions to ask the deputy speaker of the Judah parliament to ask for a "red peach" The Gandhi Hughes chief of the Card Secrets should not make himself a thief who occupies a poem. However, the deputy speaker must take care of it. Augustine did not mind to uproot the only long-lived family in the sacred empire. Both emperors fell down on the dark race of the sleeping coffin because of a royal secret scandal. Any previous emperor who was already quite disgusted with the longevity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine wrote half of it, put down the dry quill in his hand, loosened his wrist, this beautiful and tough quill was taken from the black swan in the lake, because of the misjudgment of the leaker, Mrs. Quentin was punished by the order Picking out the five or six feathers on the outermost side of the left wing of the black swan, the sizzling Florence kitten dropped nearly a hundred sharpened black goose feathers in a few days, and Augustine had to stop her. Harassment of the estate guests, otherwise the next few decades will not find the traces of the black swan. On Augustin's desk, in addition to the quill pen filled with pen holders, there is also a crow brush that is more suitable for writing fine fonts. As for the oldest reed tubes, this is a stubborn tradition in the monastery of Deola, which is always behind the empire. Occasionally, Augustine will come up with a book of the Gullan scriptures and excerpts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One double-headed gold cymbal is on the corner of the desk, both heads are looking at the "father", scarlet eye, which was first seen after birth. The shackles are full of incredible humanity. Treating this "illegitimate child" with a ruthless order of property, it is very generous and generous, and he does not hesitate to feed everything that cherishes the most expensive food. Augustine opens a crystal bottle and puts a few bloody dwarf eyeballs and long-lived bat wings. The ground bait is spread in the palm of the hand, and the golden dragonfly is not in a hurry to eat. First, the relatives bowed their heads and licked the fingers of the kindly "father", which swallowed delicious food. This action in the Golden Subspecies occult dictionary means "worship and tame", a semi-divine species symbolizing incomparable pride, only placing food in second place. Augustine smiled slightly, and stretched out a finger and flicked one of the heads. It seemed that the little guy liked his father's favorite. He was bounced, and he slid his head in a playful manner. He was quite pretending to be dead. Augustine scratched his fingers. Its gorgeous body, very soon, the little guy plunged on the table with pleasure, and when the little head hit it, he turned up and looked up at his father. It was obvious that he was spoiled, not to mention hitting the wall, it was Jianfeng. Cut down, it may not feel pain, and finally the entire gold-colored torso is wrapped around Augustine's arm, Augustine bowed his head and said: "Your mother, miss you in a distant place, she loves you more than I."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin then took off the little guy who was docile and dependent on him, bent over to the ground and smiled: "Play yourself, get familiar with your territory, Eden, there is always One day poetry song castle will need your protection."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden double-headed squatting body swam out of the study room, and soon, it reappeared at the door, knowing Will be so Augustine stare, little guy immediately ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin turned and re-painted the ink and continued to flow on the cheap papyrus. His handwriting, even in the air monastery, will be praised by the group of young and hard-working monks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There aren't any antique porcelains in the study. In addition to the books that are frequently flipped through and some wooden boxes with a few monotonous collections, there is no exquisite atmosphere in the Tame Gallery that Professor Shirley loves. Naturally, it is not comparable to Miss Elisabeth. Gothic mixed Baroque luxury boudoir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twelve zodiac magic arrays have become more and more refined. Louis Xie, who has a passionate desire for power, has integrated into a new life. As long as he can bring this beautiful man power, whether he is dark or bright, Count Marseille is happy to build an arena with such a partner. Madame Fiona, the Empress of the Salon, seems to have changed from a slut-female to a saint overnight. In addition to the girls and children carefully selected by Lolita every day, they become "swallows" and "crows", and they have consulted the believers. Practice, pray every day, the body of the already smashed and decaying plaything began to exude a devout devout. The law of the orange plus half of the Champs Elysees Street, the poetry song castle without land income gradually has a fixed source of gold coins. The female elf Heyman wrote the elf language at the request of the owner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin picked up a blank papyrus and wrote "Two Bourbon." "Joker Oscar." "The Instructor" unpublished ninth , ten, eleven, twelve, and finally thirteen volumes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon, Augustine burned the paper with a little magic that gathered fire elements. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get up and go to the fifth floor of the tulip, Hall is explaining the history of the empire to the girls, Augustine is sitting in the last row, Hall and the girl have adapted Occasionally, the order is long, and the position where the order is long, no one dares to approach, only dare to peek at the pilgrimage’s fearful attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin listened to Hall’s remarks, while drifting away from his thoughts, the last smear of smoke on the red Gogol plain, the Holy Empire won for the first time. Recognized by the epic continent, the son of the arrogant war finally acknowledged that in addition to the wonderful iron ride, there were opponents on the mainland who could compete against the Titans. The difficult victory of the Holy Empire, at the cost of more than 20,000 soldiers, and 3,500 mages who gave the official certification badge, as well as huge war loans borrowed from the big lords and bankers, is an astronomical Caesar . The decline of the Gorse dynasty in the past 100 years, historical observers are convinced that this kind of overdraft empire credit bad behavior has produced a vicious circle, endless borrowing, such as children generally do not pay back, and then forced to levy in the name of the Empire and the royal family, In the end, the tired empire and the irritated aristocratic class began to reject any war, making the giant gorse a military scorpion. Then, the sacred empire that rose at an alarming rate in the East China began to take the initiative to enter the strange circle? Everyone is watching and waiting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine remembered a question and answer between him and the Chief Secretary of State on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked: "Why is the empire's magician so powerful, is it really like the magical guild's interpretation, from the magical gods' favors and gifts?" Augustine replied: "These are irresistible mysterious factors, but what I see in my eyes is that after the end of the war, the emperor has resisted a wave. Behind the wave of the fallen knights, the great aristocratic family is martyrdom to the pastor. On the battlefield of the epic continent, the honor belongs only to the knight, and the assistant of the mage is taken for granted, but once the mistake is made and the casualties of the knight are caused, it is subject to the scolding of the military court. Question: What the Emperor’s Majesty is doing is to appease and mediate. This is not awkward, but it requires a lot of courage and mind. In the Holy Empire, the Emperor is not worried about the mass demise of the Master, and the Master is not worried about being a Knights’ group because of mistakes. Revenge, this is the tacit agreement of the virtuous circle."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin returns to God and says to himself: "It is so hard to govern a poem, then Zhu Grand Emperor, Queen of Wonders?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After quietly leaving the classroom, Augustine went to the Horns Lab, this time not playing fun games with poor Miss Yi. I asked for the best mammoth ivory, and the chief researcher who was not "favored and abused" looked at the back of the consul. His eyes were complicated, he took a deep breath, and he re-invested in the intense experiment. The body of the sacred knight Ted gave it. A big problem for Sayuri, to reach the minimum requirements of the devil, to create a hell of hell, the road is full of thorns. Augustine returned to the study, took out a razor, cut the half-meter ivory into a dozen sections, picked out the middle section and began to sculpture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first rule of the Knights Regulations: We are soldiers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 2: The second is the Cavaliers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third: Don't forget that we are nobles, lose and remember to surrender, can be redeemed, but don't forget to get a little secret in the hostile camp. This is also a battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 4: Must be sincerely praised by the handsome head of Rhein Hatha, acknowledging that the most wise of the Knights is always the Rhein-Hattai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 5: On the battlefield, you can run away, but you can't leave your comrades. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
