			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet moment when the young godfather let the godson ride on the neck and go to the garden, an invitation broke the harmonious atmosphere. The invitation was not beautifully produced. There are no extravagant gold powder and broken diamonds, but the signature is amazing enough. There is no surname, only the name. In the empire, a woman who can simply suppress the family reputation by name is very rare. Moreover, this family still has the wise priest of the Teutonic priest. "She is the Chief Secretary of State of the Academic Affairs Office, Queen of Chessier." When the old Clough saw the invitation, it was a headache. There were not many women in the empire that could make the vampire count a headache. The daughter-in-law of the family, the lady of Richmond who was seriously disagree with him, and A female housekeeper of a scavenger family, both of whom are known as the most dangerous men in the taming empire, the last one is the woman who sent the head of the Prince of Australia to the statue of St. Urban in the Edward III chapel. The old count was very angry that this wicked mother did not give face, even when the private priest had just sent an invitation to the beloved grandson to baptize the end of the warm time, he immediately called the Octavia who just wanted to pull Augustine to Jonathan to have fun. Let this son bring more family knights to escort Augustine to the Academic Affairs Office, but Augustine did not agree, but chose to go to the authority of the Empire alone to be able to marry the House of Representatives. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going to the core of the Holy See, Augustine first visited the new big man of the Imperial Magic Guild, the deputy dean of the Imperial Magician Cradle San Carlo, Taco, he Living in a small room in a civilian area, he was initially stolen, but the thief was obviously disappointed and angry at the poor man’s residence. He thoroughly read the full house’s books before taking only a few bourbon silver coins. Indiscriminately, this unfortunate thief was easily captured on the same day by an imperial inspector led by a number of high-ranking duty officers who were under pressure from the top, and almost directly thrown to the executioner of the Dongsong family without trial. However, the vice president only had to return the silver coin and canceled several additional judgments against the thief. A middle-aged professor who is not like a big man obviously didn’t expect that Master Augustine would personally go to the door. For a time, he regretted not preparing a few decent refreshments in the room. He could only burn a pot of boiling water and entertain the young aristocrat who changed his fate, even Augustine. The young master was removed from the aristocratic title, and Takko always regarded him as the true aristocratic heir of the empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine planned to confuse the middle-aged professor, sitting in a messy pile of books and materials, laughing: "Taco, you should find a room for the room." "The hostess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takohan Yan said: "Master Augustine, you mentioned a novel vocabulary called a single nobility, you know that I really like this word. And will always be respected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine smiled and talked to the child's magic teacher about the woman, just as embarrassing as the nobles talking about the sacrament. He picked up a heresy paper that was destined not to be published publicly. He looked up a few times and looked up and asked: "Tacco, then I will let people send the things in your house to the Marceau poetry castle. There, someone will specialize in your life. Will this affect the future of a deputy dean of St. Carol?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taco shakes his head Road: "I don't mind being kicked out of the college by St. Carroll, just like being beaten by the Augers City Magic Guild, I just feel relaxed. Besides, my heresy can enter San Carlo. Er, because Master Augustine, you asked the old magician Zlatoust to give a referral letter to the dean. To be honest, I prefer to go to your poetry song castle, compared to Saint-Carroll, where I am more able to study some unrecognized learning, Master Augustine, can you think about it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin said: "Don't think about it, I am coming here. Just want you to exercise the privileges of the following vice president to give a magic from the province of Richelieu Miss Xisheng successfully entered the college.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taco smiled. “I will try my best. I am glad that I have finally had a little use.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looked down and read the information, seemingly casual: "When you are more and more integrated into the new role, you will have more use of the Rotong Chald family, a holy card Lor's deputy dean is an incalculable asset to any family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taco whispered but firmly: "I will do my best." <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine joked: "For a guy who is now carrying a less friendly invitation from the Academic Affairs Office, it seems that I am too sorry for your illustrious identity. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taco shook his head and said: "This is the honor of Taco. When the Duchess gave me a sable badge, I certainly wouldn’t just take it." To change a few apples. Master Augustine, Taco's desire to explore the magic field is indeed far greater than the desire for power, but this It means that Taco is a fool. When you and Rotong Childe need me, I will never give up half a step. I am with Miss Gaga, who is going to the Mayan Temple, and Sir Rhein Hatha, who won the Iron Oak Medal. All are proud to wear the sable flower badge!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine is in silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taco whispered: "Every time I discuss the magic problem with Miss Gaga, maybe she doesn't pay attention to it. At the end of the conversation, it's always about you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustine smiled: "In the magic field without end, she is a rich woman who earns huge sums of money independently. When she was a child, she liked to despise me as a poor man. This good habit, it seems that she has to stay for a long time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Taco wants to explain something, but Augustine, who was getting up and ready to leave, interrupted: "I heard that the Chief Secretary of State’s most abhorrent innocent invitees, I should leave, lest the head be hung up on the statue of St. Urban to go to the neighbor of Prince Adis."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taco looked bitter, then Luo Isn’t the Tongchaid family a neighbor to the Prince of Australia? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly there was a slight subtle knock on the door, and Taco was wondering who would come to visit, a young lady gently pushed in and saw Augustine In the presence, the original modest face was more restrained, like a well-behaved student who immediately ran to the teacher to admit mistakes when he made a mistake. She has a gorgeously dressed chest position, wearing a glory badge, from the family, not from the second-class war medals often issued by the Imperial Army. This undoubtedly makes her well-developed chest more attractive. In the empire, the aristocratic badge can make the old and weak males easily give the most intimate women an invisible strong aphrodisiac. It also allows even the unseen women to bring the greatest conquest and accomplishment to the civilian knights, not to mention the one. The face of the glory of the glory is quite impressive, like a delicate and full of Lafite cheese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young girl standing behind the girl with a family magic teacher and wearing the Gurney family badge and the five-petal tulip magic badge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin directly passed the two. Soon, the deputy dean of Taco, who learned about the cause and effect of the San Carlo wave, sneered at his face: "From today, the glory badge is not welcome here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;The guilty Bohemian Miss tried to save the wonderful relationship that many magic interns dreamed of, but Taco fell directly to the door. She didn't understand why the middle-aged professor who was so isolated would be willing to spend an hour explaining to her the ridiculous question of "what is magic," because this was his first conversation with Augustine when he met at the civilian college, Taco. The foundation of the goodwill of this noble lady came from this, but it is clear that the proud Bohemian Miss accidentally broke the foundation. She stood behind the door, with red eyes, looking at the old Luxembourg with no help. The latter can only comfort: "Miss, patience, no one will refuse the sincerity of Datongtong, as long as you come several times, Taco The Associate Dean will forgive your small mistakes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clever Miss Bohemian asked: "Do you need me to apologize to Augustine? He is, after all, a new giant in the Ministry of the Holy See. It seems that it is not difficult to get along."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Old Luxembourg denied: "I advise you to dispel this unwise idea, this is a disrespect for the Vice President of Taco, and Becky is not willing to go too close to the Ministry of the Holy See." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bohemian eager to turn away from this dirty civilian room secretly swearing: "That guy is bringing nearly 10 million Caesar gold coins to the Grizzlies The hapless? How does it look different from the rumors at the banquet, so young, um, a little handsome, and a very good magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Old Luxembourg is bitter in the heart, there is no such thing, how can you live away from the emperor and live to return to the emperor? At the very least, the young and uncomfortable guy rode the horses leaving San Carlo, but each horse was recorded in the official pedigree of the empire, and the horse was a madman. The only mistress, the magician sighed: "Miss, you are still a little farther away from him. That guy, who recently cut off the head of the son of the Marquis of Todd, was thrown at the foot of the Lion King in front of the entire Knights, then Going to the Villa of the Condido family, the head of a Viscount was cut off on the spot."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bohemian sits in a noble carriage pulled by the Ulm horse, if Thoughtful, apparently she did not listen to the advice of too many private magic teachers, the curiosity on the face is more than fear. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin came to the Academic Affairs Institute and presented an invitation letter. The guardian knight seemed to be surprised that a stranger with the Secretary of State’s personally written invitation letter did not have a special greet. Augustine walked into the corner of the Academic Affairs Office building, without a familiar face. This is reasonable. In the imperial capital, the old Claf family, who has been diluted for many years, and the Nonglu Pompei family, Who would like to have a little relationship with a mobile plague, the friends of the elegant Duke of Luotong Childe, tacitly forgotten the only son of the tyrant's Duke. Augustine stepped on the fourth floor of the rosewood floor in the middle of the mahogany, but did not ring the room with the label of the Secretary of State, but at the end of the corridor overlooking the palace, the emperor Unexpectedly tolerant, he not only recognized the official status of a series of trade professions such as bankers, but also tacitly decided that some wealthy families do not lose their private homes in the suburbs. They don’t even care about sightseeing in a good time. These horticultural buildings make a few small suggestions. At the same time, Jupiter is a well-deserved master of political art. He has more control over power than any emperor in the history of the sacred empire, such as the original detached academy. The border army that has been weakened by the Titan Empire but has been unreasonable in the country, the next goal seems to be the Ministry of the Sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Excuse me, are you?" asked a well-dressed slender lady, who was a clerical officer of the Academic Affairs Office. She was a privileged person who could frequent the Secretary of State’s study. She wore a costume that would highlight her beautiful figure and distribute it. With a youthful and elegant intellectual atmosphere, young women who have not been polished by life generally have little so-called gas fields, but this one who is only in the Academic Affairs Office is the same as the eighth-class singer, and she did not ask when she asked. Condescending questioning, but equal, quiet. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Augustine turned around and stared at the Miss Dean civilian homes, smiled and said: <br /> < "Prior to see Secretary of State, I want to adjust the way I feel." Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She will smile, it’s a fun academy guest, many invited people are busy or excited and then hurry to ring the door, standing in the corridor window to see the scenery He is the first to adjust his emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin saw the corner of the book she was holding, and stunned and asked, "Can you lend me a piece of paper? It is best not to return it to you." That kind of."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hesitated for a moment, to make sure that he was not a boring aristocrat who made a strange request to win his favor, and tore off a piece that was not yet in the capital The blank page of the poems that had been circulated inside was handed to him. The thick collection of poems in her hands is a classic book recommended by the Secretary of State not long ago, and is highly regarded as destined to become the most important knight epic in the modern era, and will last for hundreds of years. She didn't believe it at first, thinking that it was just a usual knight's praise, but after a few pages, she was immediately moved by the unpretentious words of poetry. She found that she never respected a knight, even if the knights in the poetry concentrated Not famous in the sacred empire, never made a feat. Since she was a child, she was not a lady who would admire any of the six great knights of the Empire, but this time it was an exception. Correspondingly, she began to try to change her inherent vision to see a strange peer of a subtle relationship with the poetry collection. This collection of touching poems that she carries with me so that she can read at any time is called "The Eyes of the Blind". In that sense, the peers who contributed to this epic, called Augustine, often like to stay up late to study and give the poetry protagonist Lao Tangji Jude tells the aristocratic youth of strange stories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always a problem in these days that lingers in her mind, will sit in the moonlight and tell the old man Ji Jude a little story of a young man, already have Has he been a good girl in a small village in his mind? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest standing alone in front of her dresses up the youth, folds out the paper as a very novel gadget, like one of the most simple origami crafts, gently handing Returning to her, making a throwing action outside the window, then heading to the Chief Secretary of State’s room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
