			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I think Augustin’s world should have its own unique principles and honors, and such a world can be rigorous and interesting.)<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women's paranoia is irrational, such a crazy and powerful enemy is more headache than the big family who used to be a wall grass, with her excellent blood, if沦 is the birthing tool of the big family of Greenspan, and Rotong Childe may be dragged into the abyss of blood and revenge.” Augustine squinted, and he himself came from the comprehensive strength and stayed in the top 20 of the Holy Empire. The ancient family has a deep understanding of the huge hidden dangers caused by the chess pieces of Hera Bolsefele. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large family with a strategic vision attaches great importance to the formation of a reasonable and solid three-generation echelon of the old, middle and young, in the family inheritance, one has ambition and crisis The sense of aristocrats will use a large number of lover's illegitimate son to make up for the thinness of his wife's birth. Looking through the thick "Imperial Who's Who", you will find that nearly two-thirds of the great politicians and meritorious generals of the empire history are born of illegitimate children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They may reinvigorate the glory of the family, and each generation of the top ten ancient families of the Empire will have a number of such "saviors", such as Augsburg North The Afrodite and Constantine appeared one after the other; or simply rid of the old family to create their own dynasty, such as the emperor Pompeii and Maso Greenspan, the so-called "upstart" emerging family, Entering a fresh and violent blood for the empire, if you want to permanently engrave the family crest on the marble of the glass gallery of St. John's Royal Church, you will inevitably need to continue to emerge from the heirs of blue and blue. Augustine frowned: "When her individual strength and fertility are truly accepted by a family, I am afraid it will be difficult to find a good chance. Elizabeth, you don't understand." The world of our human aristocracy, even if it is the removal of the Emperor of the Prince of Australia, has to face the endless endless revenge. On your muse, perhaps the most proud race will succumb to more powerful forces, but loyal to The family is far better than the aristocrats who are loyal to the empire. They can go to death with great enthusiasm for honor. Just like our Luo Tongchaid, the family knight who died of revenge is no less than the one that is dragged on the gallows. So, I Be sure to send her to hell before she joins a family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The problem is to leave a lot of high-level 扈 扈 from the Cavaliers on the 3rd floor Not to mention the private magician, there are many mysterious forces interested in Hera Bolsefele on the 2nd floor. You are a 5th-level magician who wears two purple lily badges, even if I am willing to play with you. Sex games, There is not a high chance that this miracle mission can be accomplished.” Miss Elizabeth, who was still on Augustin’s thigh, said that if someone else heard the idea of ​​Augustine’s Arabian Nights, it’s estimated that it’s already collapsed, and Little Lori is very serious. Starting to calculate the probability, it seems that in her cognition, the attempt to fight with Augustine is the most insignificant thing. What interests her is not why she does it, but how to do it, how to minimize her own losses. The biggest profit, "If you attract attention, I sneak past to see if I can cut her in half. Then each of them begins to flee, see who can escape the crow market, I bet 4 bourbon silver coins I won."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rough and simple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has always been a good style for Miss Elizabeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the four bourbon silver coins happen to be the last family of Augustine, and the loli housekeeper who has private wealth and the public property of the two is very clear to them. Because the cover is more beautiful and more expensive, "Flowers and Blood 2" has been spread in the empire, and she is not afraid to lose to the "woman of Zeus". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a second time, I believe there may be a good chance in the future. But the premise is that the followers of the Grand Master of the Great Arcane Masters have Not less than my predicted loyalty, if there is no external force, I am not willing to let Miss Elizabeth take risks.” Augustine smiled and touched the head of Xiao Loli, the ally in the arms should be quietly completed by him. The gestation of the ovum stage began to advance to the semi-mature body. He did not want a bad battle to interrupt her evolutionary process, which was not worth the loss in Augustine's entire game. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, Hera-Borsefler still has too many unknown variables, maybe she will die the same day as ordinary women, and she will die the next day. In the big silk bed of the great aristocrats, such an example is not uncommon in the empire. The nobles who have smashed the high-quality alchemy drugs and rubbed the "Gol" oil can always explode more vigorously than the youth. With the help of various props, the women who had a certain advantage in the bed war should finally be left behind. Of course, this is the most wonderful and sinister speculation of Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price has shouted outrageous 1.2 million Caesar gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if all are converted into Caesars, it will cost 1,200, which is the ninth price in the history of the empire’s nearly ten-year auction. In addition to the high cost, the legal orange also earns 800,000 gold coins. In addition, the signboard of the French orange will spread to all corners of the empire, which is the biggest gain. The Earl of Marseille, who had already laughed at his mouth, felt that his position as a deputy magistrate from the county of Maso County was very close. Who would let the Marceau County have a Marquis executive who would treat Caesar gold as God? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera-Borsefeller stood in the middle of the column, looking cold and proud, as if she was not a slave to the Caesar gold coin, but a high-ranking queen, Taunting this group of cowardly people who did not dare to go to the jihad to cut the enemy but only use money to play the childish game. She is the daughter of Zeus and Andrea, and she is a 11th-level arcane who grew up as a big knight in actual combat, except that She is a freckle fat man who does not follow the Cavaliers' rules. She has personally cut off the heads of more than 20 high-ranking imperial knights. She could continue to harvest the knight's head and harvest the honor until she inherits the "Savior." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark and ugly Luo Tong Childe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera-Bolsefoll clenched his fists, his nails sinking into his palms and oozing scarlet blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her world has only a proud war and a calm death, she is fearless, even if the body will be defiled by a noble, she will not be like The ordinary lady of the empire is crying like that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera-Bolseforle suddenly squeezing the pupils, the five fingers suddenly loosened, because she saw a few familiar figures in the lobby on the first floor, From a woman's point of view, that may be the greatest gospel, but for the Savior's heirs, it is definitely the picture that I don't want to see. The "savior" of the arduous jungle warfare and guerrilla warfare in Saxon Forest is different from the vast and rich sacred empire. In the poor and difficult living soil of Saxon, the growth of any high-ranking warrior or magician is an inestimable wealth. The loss of this little monk is naturally the biggest pain of the "savior." She always thought that it would be an empire's conspiracy to auction her in an imposing manner instead of throwing it into a religious ruling. She has been praying that her father and the savior's many flower ambassadors don't have a feverish mind. It seems that the former has kept the maximum. Calm, and a small group of the most elite of the latter failed to sink into the trap, Hera whispered: "The stupid selfish person thinks that with outstanding personal force, I can take me out of the law. Orange? Even if you are lucky enough to escape the French orange and crow market, can you escape from the county of Maso? Can you escape the chase of the Imperial Knights and the Ministry of the Holy See?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Hera, who advocates rationality, has never been a romantic. She can even foresee that she will become a big bait for the empire to savior and seduce a group of irrational people for suicide rescue. Once the empire, the battlefield was actively placed in the middle of the empire, rather than the Saxon Forest, which was so large and complex that the Knights could not play the role of the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empire can use ten knights in Saxon's death to exchange for the growth of a knight, but the savior can't afford this loss, Hera can't imagine The savior is young and elite because she is alone and has no honor to speak on a strange battlefield. She died in a powerful cofferdam. Like a powerful but humble mouse that was only killed by cats, Hera’s eyes were dim because She has done nothing to this tragic ending. She has done the most favorable sacrifice to the Savior after being bought and sold, but she is still trying to break the last hope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a woman's sorrow?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera Bolsefele bowed her head and she was strong and she finally shed tears after the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenspan lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the barbarian’s opponent gave a record-breaking 1.5 million Caesar gold coins, the yellow sunflower medalist who was standing near the railing on the third floor pinched In the hands of a delicate glass filled with jewels of red wine, the anger was taken back to the position. The other 20 members of Greenspan were not as shy as the heirs of the young man, because they all knew that the Helen family in the province of Kirchshire was sitting opposite. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the merits of the battle, Greenspan, who has been madly fighting for war in all parts of the empire in recent years, must be above the "girly" Helen family, but on the rich, I am afraid that only the top ten huge families can suppress the "girly" who never go to the battlefield but are good at commercial speculation. The rise of the banking industry is largely due to the Helen family's help. Without Helen's operation, no wave is all. Bankers praised the "Orange Battle", and the banking industry that was not approved by the Empire was to be cradle in the early days of its birth. In addition, Helen has always been a good boy, and many of the emperors and even the Archbishops have their own under the table and the big bed. A beautiful figure that is beautiful and beautiful. In short, this is a perverted opponent who can't be provocative with fists and spears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the victory of civilization against barbarism." A young man from the Helen family who is even more handsome than the heirs of Greenspan is self-indulgent, his slim body. It is definitely not suitable for catching a Cavalier rifle or a swordsman sword, but he wears a precious dress that can make the Emperor's fashionable aristocrats unable to pick out the shackles. The feminine face makes him beautiful, and the price for Helen is the second. The general housekeeper, his personal butler, Dow Jones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After winning, he finally got up slowly and walked to the railing with the winner's gesture, looking to the column that had slightly exceeded the 3rd floor. Sexually interesting, but the family is very interested in the goods, Hera Bolsefele, in his view, the commercial operation of the law orange did not make a big mistake, but the Marseille and the arms dealer behind the law orange did not A clever head of the Helen family, in his view, the "woman of Zeus" placed in the orange auction of the law itself is a failure, only he can send this identity-sensitive beautiful female slave to the paradise of money, and Not rolling in the mud of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled and said something that shocked the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you provoke your robes and let me take a look at your two long legs? I have to make sure that the money I have thrown is worth the money." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Hera Bolsefele was angered by this great shame, and she stared at the conceited heir of a certain family in the empire. If she was on the battlefield, she would definitely put his head. Together with the body, it is split into two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My kitten is angry? Why? Is it still remembering your funny identity? Isn’t that stuff not being taken down by Isiah fat? Is it worthless in a moment?” The feminine man smiled, and the heroic effort of throwing out 1.5 million Caesar gold coins allowed everyone downstairs to actively filter out his slightly feminine emphasis, which has countless military aristocrats with the Titan Empire. Willing to kneel on the ground to kiss the head of Princess Barbara, the powerful aristocrats can always let any opponent lower his head, even if he is a sissy who may be beaten by another big aristocrat at night. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stop your insult to Miss Hera."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A burly man dressed as an ordinary Know when you have reached the lower end of the column and look up at the feminine man on the side of the railing on the 3rd floor. The tone is calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are?" The young man who is one of the high-ranking successors of the Helen family keeps a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Grand Knight Descartes." The strong knight calmly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Civil Descartes, if I remember correctly, the head on your shoulder can be worth a lot of Caesar gold coins. If you cut it down, you can get a few yellow sunflower medals. Helen's heirs did not forget to bite a bite on a chest wearing a yellow sunflower military medal. In fact, although the gold content of the yellow sunflower is far less than the iron oak medal that a general also dreams of, but at least it must rely on the actual record to be from the Imperial Army. Honor awarded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I only hope that today will be the last battle between the knights until I am cut off my head." The big knight Descartes took out the sword, face Knee down on the knees toward the cylinder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to the French Orange today, not expecting to save a princess like the poetry poetry, any one growing up in the Saxon Forest The knights are far from romance and poetry, and Descartes just wants to complete a shackle from the last mission, protecting his flowers until death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the tragic strength of the Saxon forest heresy, this is the final honor of the Knights Descartes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a knight finally chooses to draw from the source of faith, he can often have an affiliated belief above the level of the Haiping line of faith. This is a high coefficient of personal loyalty and individual glory, because of the fragility of love, their mature path. It is often slower than a knight who chooses many religions such as religion and family. Once mature and strong, this vein is called a member of the "Violet" knight by the bard, and will be closer to the Knights of the Holy Grail. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth empire of the Empire, Gugli Gree, the biggest singer of sable, is that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Duchess gave up the right to asylum from the other two ancient surnames, and chose to walk on the gallows with her husband, they challenged the Imperial Cavaliers without defeat. The Sixth Cavalier of the Empire finally disappeared into the dust after the assassination of the Emperor. The sixth horse on the sixth page of the Imperial Knights, more than 20 years ago, can make the white horse silver gun screaming knights of the imperial capital of the city of Judah. Nor did it appear in the public eye, and even the Imperial Knights and the Ministry of the Holy See could not collect any information from him. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for the great knight Descartes, Hera-Boer Sefele once dying, then his source of faith is exhausted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herrah above the column sighed, then sighed softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin noticed that several people quietly left the legal orange auction hall when everyone was concerned about Descartes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first time Descartes challenged, three members jumped from the second and third floors, surrounded by triangles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of a heretical knight can not only sell money, but also a medal with a very high gold content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a mile from Helen, the closest from Descartes, with long blonde hair hanging down to the waist, nearly two meters tall, at least two hundred and fifty pounds The weight, but he did not use the giant axe weapon that is consistent with the majestic body, but only a dark gold dagger in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is Greenspan’s private magician, a 5-petal tulip badge, about 50 years old, and a promising younger one among the magicians. For the mage who is immersed in the magical world, 50 years old, basically only halfway through the life, can be among the tulip magicians before the age of 50, almost equal to the hand of the Royal Magic Society Gold Shamrock Medal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
