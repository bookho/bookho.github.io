And the bishop of Willian has been anxious to prepare to go back and like good friends to tell the good fortune today, the pace of going downstairs is fast and fast. The bishops felt that it was necessary to withdraw some of the bad comments on the private affairs of the Secretary of State. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Gesell heard a very special knock on the door, it was rare to have a good mood, took off the glasses, rubbed his temples, and waited quietly outside the door. For the special guest, even the formula "coming in" is omitted. Even if she was visiting the Marquis de Todd, the lion king who was ravaged by the North Ice Cream, she did not add a "please" before "coming in." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Napoleon entered the room, he opened all the curtains on his own initiative, and the office that was not dark was getting brighter. He went to the epic Dalat In front of the Virgin of Phil, she stared at the quaint pattern on the armor. Few people dare to relax in front of Queen Gesell, but Napoleon is different. He first met her. He was a teenager who was exposed to theological books under the guidance of the old shepherd. She was only a permanent resident in the royal family. The library or the literary teacher of the St. John's Cathedral Library, like the little white cat he was with, was like that. When she saw her, she licked her shoulders and kissed her cheek. From the moment, Napoleon believed This is a trusted lady. Many years later, he grew up as the priest of the Holy See, the blessing of the emperor, the hero of the empire, but Napoleon is still willing to follow her footsteps, so when she said that she would go out to the sea to find the new continent, the empire needs an occupation of the epic continent. The first opportunity of the trend, he immediately put down the glory of the imperial empire, rushed to an unknown dangerous area, the death rate was as high as 80% during the voyage, most of them died of strange diseases, and half died in various crises. He used to be comrades-in-arms. I have witnessed two ancient deep-sea behemoths that are clearly defined in the Imperial Encyclopedia, 40-meter-long red whales, and hundreds of thick tentacles that can cover the sky. Of course, the novel world is also relatively romantic. The episodes, such as the arrival of the ocean, need to find human male-cross-matching mermaids, most of them beautiful, the upper body is the same as human females, but more curved and full of singing, and they are not as good as in mythical novels. Cruel, he will swallow the "husband" after pregnancy, but erase his memory with a song and try to send it back to the land. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Napoleon, who is not dead, sees too much danger and beauty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His travel diary, forthcoming, is believed to be a best-selling book that rivals the old Titan’s "Flowers and Blood." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Napoleon smiled and asked: "Sister, why is the bishop of Willian come to report to you today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State wiped the lens, the glasses in her hand were hard-won, The entire epic continent, the number does not exceed one hand, because it comes from the black dragon "Dandong" that died in the White Rose Dynasty, the material is the most precious dragon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon rarely shows up, the ice dragon of 120 years ago was not expelled from the dragon's point under any circumstances, and was seriously injured in the sky. Lonely flew for thousands of miles, and finally slammed in the city of the White Rose, which was eclipsed by an astrologer called the white rose. The history is strikingly matched with the prediction that the former mainland first empire has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. The spade a, which began to decline, is now a marginal spectator at the Continental Kings Roundtable. In many incidents, it chooses a weak abstention, even less than the sacred empire Jupiter, who is unwilling to participate in a roundtable meeting. Kami's iron hoof has been run through several small Principalities, no longer far from the border of the White Rose. It is rumored that the young emperor who had just succeeded the throne of the White Rose was scared to be in the palace after hearing that the Queen of the Queen was sitting in the battle and looking at his empire. Cried with a headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Kosher reached out and stroked the little white cat and smiled: "After returning from Maso County, the bishops did not happen to have a serious illness. So today I was forced to come to the Academic Affairs Office and I should be considerate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Napoleon shrugged his shoulders and did not express his opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Cosher re-appears her glasses, the little white cat jumps off her shoulders, squats on the desk and sleeps, the biggest difference from the average cat is that it has a separate A pretty scarlet scorpion exudes more radiance than the finest rubies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no extra chair in this room, even if the emperor is in the presence of the emperor, he can only stand, the chief secretary of state said an extremely straightforward truth: standing Can make the lazy nobles talk less nonsense. Napoleon turned to look at the wall behind her, walked over, and pulled out a heretical book, "The Scorpion under the Pope's Robe", quietly reading, not rushing to leave, bowed and asked: "Sister, you are going to let cosmo grow stronger." At the beginning, except for the Emperor's Majesty, no one chose to bet on the cosmo. Now that the Clough family has joined, I believe that Greenspan, who has never been patient, will not hold on for too long. There are too many families in the Empire. I have a good impression on the aster flower. This is not in line with your style of action. All young enemies seem to be dying."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled and said: "Small Napoleon, you seem to be more anxious than me? How, hostile to the young man who walked out from the Ola and the night watchman? This is not in line with your style."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Napoleon smiled bitterly: "I am not hostile to him, just don't want a madman who sees you as the biggest enemy to live well and become a heresy recognized by the empire. Because there is a kind of heresy, total One day it will grow up and all the enemies who are strong enough to make it into it. This is the last advice and warning given to me by the teacher during his lifetime."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;歌谢尔The queen put on her glasses and stood up. It was half a head higher than Napoleon wearing a big priest robes. No way, the empire’s sun monk was only 5 feet 2 inches tall, which was promoted by the card empire. The more accepted measurement standard, about 168 cm, is probably an important reason why many weak aristocrats are willing to stand by Napoleon for a long time. The female secretary of state went to the window and looked at the square outside the building. Her eyes were quiet. After she entered the Academic Affairs Office, the pedestrians who walked through the White Square invisibly accelerated a few points. However, under the calm surface, the Academic Affairs Office has been undercurrent, this time. The discovery of the New World is undoubtedly the credit of her and Napoleon, but the next round of fruitful fruit was easily taken away by the Rachel Tiger, and then went to Napoleon to go to the empire to name the members of the Senate of the Gospel continent. The third is the second secretary of the Secretary of State. She originally wanted to protest to the Emperor, but after meditation in this room for a night, she still dismissed the idea. The man who brought the sacred empire to the peak of the mainland once silenced, often It means that he has made a decision that cannot be changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Napoleon whispered softly: "He really said that?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secretary of State wrinkles Frowning, no reply. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Napoleon smashed the last layer of paper directly: "I will nail you to the St. John's tripod and watch you until you have the last drop of blood." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Kosher laughed and turned to look at the worried priest, saying: "This sentence can always remind me to stand behind me." The sacred scorpion, full of hatred and fighting spirit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Napoleon sighed while reading "The Scorpion under the Robe". She looked at the St. Urban's sculpture in the Edward Chapel not far away. The dry head of the Prince of Australia was completely weathered and turned into dust. In that year, 43 of the knights, led by the Prince, came to the Imperial City with a tragic victory. I have been loved and worshipped by all the people in Jupiter City. She still remembers clearly that she is standing in the crowd, riding on the eyes of the Undisposed Prince of Australia at the tall Ulm army, facing countless Flowers and cheers, only a strong sarcasm in the corner of the mouth. In the epic battle that shocked the mainland, no one in the empire's most brave warriors regressed, no one surrendered, and the hard-boiled 120,000 Titans resisted strangling in the dusk basin, and even won the highest admiration of the always arrogant war son. The twilight battle was unparalleled and magnificent. It made people forget the cold-blooded spectators of the two Confederate regimes on the Imperial Front. Afterwards, the two generals were only dismissed. The Imperial Military Court did not even call the coward who buried the Black Rose Knights. When the royal literature teacher became the secretary of state and touched a part of the confidential documents that were not destroyed, he knew that there was a dark insider in the middle who could not explore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Gesell was immersed in meditation, and the Office of the Secretary of State had a long silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Secretary of State Sadie’s office should be on the fourth floor according to specifications, but Rachel’s Tiger chose the more crowded third floor, unlike the fourth floor chief secretary of state. The sparseness of the guests, the office of the imperial hawks’ core figures is always overcrowded, and many of the great aristocrats who come to the Office of the Office of Education are willing to go to the young owners of the Rachel family, and most of them can be obtained from the second secretary of the Secretary of State. Some surprises, when the orange battle was not over, it was Sadi’s first official breaking of the official silence, giving the sissy Helen family a definite news, which made the banking industry, which has been dystocia in recent years, flourish and swept the whole seat. The empire became another brand new face of the military aristocracy that emerged after the civilian knight in the jihad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, the office of Rachel’s Tiger finally sent away the tenth batch of guests, and the Secretary of State had some chance to breathe alone, drinking a small range The popular Soviet liquor, the study is filled with a strong wine. The tiger, who was ridiculed by the hostile forces and ridiculed by the mothers, is now the most sought-after red man in the empire. He also has a lot of voice in the "gospel" and the new round of jihad, especially the former, he is equal to Holding the knife and fork that cuts the cheese by hand, the cheese that is hand-divided is the one who is big and who is small. He has the final say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young knight knocked into the door, the dragon gun rider Fermi Joseph, a political star who came out of the sacrament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fermi, seeing the idol in your heart, what do you think?" The second secretary of state was in a good mood, started a joke, pointed his finger The spirits produced by the Imperial empire, which the Imperial soldiers are increasingly fond of, signal the young people to do it themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dragon Gun Knight fell a half cup, and drank it, laughing: "I still wear a shabby robe, still not like a ruling big man." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadi laughed: "It seems to be a very annoying guy, generally into the category of charismatic leaders in The Ideal. When I listen To the old Clough that guy actually sent 120 扈 from the knight, the first feeling is that this old guy is out of heart, I believe most people are like this. I heard that you have not left the Marceau County, the Black Swan Lake broke out A small but high-profile wonderful war. Fermi, you seem to have missed a good show, disappointed?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young knights respectfully put down the wine glasses Shaking his head: "I don't like the war. I respect only those comrades-in-arms or enemies who have spared their lives for their convictions on the battlefield."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
