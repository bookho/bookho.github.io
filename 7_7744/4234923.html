			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main building of the ground part of the Poetry Castle has been completely flattened by [Sgarti Soul Elegy], and it is impossible to recover in a short time, but the castle is abnormal. Busy, the Horns Lab, in the hands of the chief research officer Yu Yi, nearly a day and 20 hours of personal urging under the mad test, the most cumbersome and complex "soul dilution" of the two powerful knights who were 12 vertices before birth, and then "Soul Filling". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exploration of these spiritual levels relies on the fragmentary information of the pioneers, and more needs to be bold and meticulously verified like the latecomers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole sheep's horn is now divided into three forces, respectively, by Professor Yi, Shirley and Kim, who was promoted by the governor in the near future. The former two occupied a large knight body to compete, while the lonely and silent Kim led the team to try to knock open the bottleneck of [artificial nuclear] according to the mage test body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth no longer appears in the public eye, hiding in the lair, even Augustine's occasional visits are rejected by her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin’s day is full and boring, getting up at 4 in the morning to pray, whether or not he is out of piety to the Vatican’s Holy See, or to the Odeon In the memory of the monastery, he tried to keep the habit of praying every day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the prayer, take the pen and ink to the 9th floor to study the magical array of 12 ecliptic palaces that have been greatly improved by the dwarf Aubrey's hand, and accurately draw a part of the piece. After handing the manuscript to Hera, it was almost the same time that the girls started to get up to receive Hera education in the morning. After the lecture, Hera will lead Agatha and Juliet who have been able to draw qualified magic lines and go to the ground. The black swan lake manor land creates a landmark on the land. Finally, the hard-working Knights led by Philippine will build the stone pillars according to the signs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horn horn magician Little Hall was brought up by Augustine to explain the magic basic course to the girls. If Augustine is in a good mood, he will sit in the last row of the lecture hall, let the batch fill The energetic beginner throws a lot of seemingly naive but direct magic core problems to Xiao Hall. Fortunately, the small Hall is involved in a lot of troubles, and he can barely cope with the problem of being unrestrained. It is really stumped, and Augustine will stand up and help him out of the predicament. And then will leave quietly at some point. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical world is so huge and complex that many magicians have been spinning around in a certain area for the rest of their lives, similar to the magical relationship between Vatican and Byzantine. The same is true of the Austrian Holy See, which led Augustine to give up his talent in arcaneism. Even if he hopes to reach the so-called Divine of St. Jerome in his lifetime, the Empire and the Holy See will not give him such ample time. A wave of invading Black Swan Lake has already consumed half of Augustin's cards, and it is hard to imagine how a strong follow-up offensive will follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine walked on the third floor of the labyrinth and muttered to himself: "It seems that you really need an ally on the table, otherwise the cosmo can only be a gorgeous empty shell. The question is who to look for, the county of Maso County is closest to the Black Swan Lake. One of the estates belongs to Todd, one is Greenspan, the lion king Todd is too upright, and is not a family that is willing to do business with a sacramental institution. Greenspan is a good choice, what is the tradable chip? The right of asylum of the big executives? How many gold coins can this promise in the eyes of the barbarians?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Augustine went to the ninth floor, he already Making countless ideas, even including the delivery of Hera Bolsefele to Greenspan, the heir to the Baath Medal, can be overthrown quickly, and this is by no means an adequate way for the barbarians to drag into the quagmire. reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred empire can last for more than three generations. The family basically has a special spirit to support it. The Pompeii family is a "war with heresy," and Edward is the "duke." Honor", Niang Hailun is "Gold is the second God", although Greenspan is recognized as a nouveau riche, but it has something that allows Augustine to appreciate, that is "the only loyalty", only loyal to emperor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin crossed the 8th floor, did not bother Miss Elizabeth, who was busy in the lair, and went straight to the bottom, looking at God’s left eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know that Miss Alice of the Greenspan family had already quietly extended an olive branch to him on the way to the castle of Poetry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin sat on the steps, looking to the coffin where the Prince-level lecch Dimit was stored not far away, and took out a bourbon silver coin. Give up, the opposite will give up."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin throws silver coins, it spins rapidly in the air, eventually falls to the ground, hovering on the ground for a long time, just before it will show the front and back The moment before, Elizabeth appeared behind Augustine. The delicate and beautiful gorse-style princess was stained with a lot of blood and elemental stains. It looked tired and the pupils with opposite eyes were faint, but it should be no small progress. She screamed: "I can immediately help you create two magnificent witches. We are the perfect crystallization of our saxman and your dark magical Irish undead books. It is the combination of the Knights and Magicians of the Necromancer version, which will surely make the next flies all become fresh blood. Under this virtuous cycle, as long as there is no trident to deal with your embarrassing situation, Poem brother castle will fail, wow ha ha, wise and great Queen Elizabeth had the biggest rely on Augustine's "<br /> <br /> & nbsp;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;Augustine turned his head, grateful, and a little uncomfortable absent-minded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth squinted, wrinkled his face and sat next to him, shouting: "Do you still want to take risks and start God's left eye?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stretched out and looked at the princess dress that had almost been scrapped. He smiled and said: "Try to let Miss Elizabeth live the life of a noble lady, isn't it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth snorted and said, "If you are dead, I can only return to the Muse on the ash."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine shook his head and didn't speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth sighed and asked, "Do you really want to gamble?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin turned Head, squinting, looking at the magical and complicated large magical array, whispered: "My patience is almost at the tipping point, and I don't want to do anything. It is estimated that I am going crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth seriously said: "You can use Hera as a venting tool."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looked weird, hesitated, and smiled bitterly: "If the body gets malformed satisfaction, it will only accelerate the collapse of the spirit. Moreover, you should not forget what the source of faith I majored in is the saint of piety. I don't want to be destroyed by desire before reaching the great knight. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth complained: "Why do you choose the most sparst saints of the unpopularity? In history, only a few holy martyrs, such as St. Eugen, chose this Source of Faith."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the 8 main systems of the Cavaliers For the believers, the godfather and the most difficult saints, it is ridiculous that many of the childish knights who have chosen to live and choose the saints have never taken energy from the source, and only Augustine, who has been working hard for many years at the Ola Theological Seminary. In order to grasp the tail of the saints, a "teaching" by Vatican Titan as the latest official book of the Holy See, this great work from the dying of the godfather of Ignatius, is the most hidden pillar of the Knights of Augustine. After all, he is the only lucky person in the world who is involved in the writing of "The Teachings". He is also the two interpreters who are in the same sequence as the Holy See in his personal capacity. Before the death of Saint Iyeta, he will teach all the manuscripts. It is probably the root cause of the Holy See’s failure to punish Augustine for expelling the teachings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
