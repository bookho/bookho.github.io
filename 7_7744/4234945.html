			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After wearing the frosty frost of England, the Marquis of England fell into the land, bent over and extended his hands to pick up his son’s head and got up. Hold the skull in one hand and pull out the simple and heavy sword and walk into the castle. There is only one dragon knight, and it is possible to easily bend over with such a weight. Generally, the low-level knight wears an epic armored ice cream made of special materials. It is sure that even the horses can't cross, the Marquis of Todd's Marquis All hidden behind the visor, behind him is a group of nearly 100 people, almost every young man who was smashed in the twilight battle of the Titan Warrior, at the peak of the knight career, they are the Red Lion Knights The sharpest paws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of England went directly to the suite that the son had carefully arranged. As the dual leader of the Todd family spirit and strength, he had a strong control over the family, heir What did the Earl of Heber do, wrong or wrong, someone will report it to him for the first time, but he has chosen to know a lot of things, such as the Mississippi Arena and some bounty hunters associations that are listed in the imperial blacklist. Cooperation, dealing with some underground military workshops on the border of the Maso County, because this can send blood and food to the red lion, a lion is hungry, and will be killed by the evil dog. Maso County is too close to the emperor, too More like barbarian Greenspan and sissy Helen, who are unwilling to the old aristocrats; some scandals he chooses to ignore, like Heber is responsible for receiving the rooms of the allies, because in the eyes of the Marquis in England, it is just a heir to the innocence. Private hobbies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;扈 From the Cavaliers, collectively draw a long sword, the light is reflected on the sword, the corridor is mixed and shining, mapping a hateful face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon knight who clenched the giant sword came to the open-plan suite, holding the other person’s spoils but his son’s head, without saying a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The empty deluxe room, only the cosmo consul who stood face to face with the Marquis of England, the number one executioner in the former Vigil organization, Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Augustin, kneel down your head, I will personally take two heads to the city of Judit to kneel down to the emperor to plead guilty." England Marquis Shen Shen, Take a step forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you can get yours, your elegant lady, and all the heirs of the Todd family, a series of heads, no one is alone. So, I am much more fortunate than the old neighbor, Prince Odis.” Augustine smiled, he was still standing at the window, no Mrs. Quentin, no Fiona and Sister Blanche, even the closest ally, Elizabeth. No trace, only one dragon knight's undead knight, Sayuri. Augustine held a stack of confession books in his hand and raised his hand. "The lion king who believes in knight justice, need me to read the confession of a daughter-in-law who is about the same age as you? The content is very exciting, no matter whether I can get out of the poem today. Manor, I believe that His Majesty the Emperor and the Ministry of Faith can relish this confession that is not very smooth but very 'skinny'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of England did not have the kindness reminder of the young giants, and took the second step heavily and forcefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mrs. Fiona, a private daughter-in-law that you don't really like, mentioned a very interesting episode in the letter, she used to be here. The big bed in the suite was with Mrs. Heber to chat with Ms. Emma. Oh, it was the Emma who gave birth to two illegitimate children.” Augustine seems to care less about the Lion King’s decision and continue to be irritated. This Marquis lion, known for his bravery. "to chat with"? Fools know how to chat in a big bed of men and women. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The owner of Todd is still stubborn and the sword is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's more interesting is that I have friends who are familiar with Ms. Emma. When you leave the territory, I also go to the city of Salome in your name. Inviting her to visit the Ascott Manor, of course, I have not forgotten the pair of innocent and lovely twin children. Although the great knights you arranged in Salom City are very powerful and very loyal, you can see that my entire cosmo is in the nest. There is only one dragon dragon knight in front of you. This is unreasonable, right? You guessed it, the wise king of lion, I spent a lot of thought and enough sincerity to 'invite' the mother and the child." Augustine said to himself. In the words, the Marquis of England is only four meters away from him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lion King is still holding the sword, without feelings: "Let you down, the embers of the Luo Tong Chaid family, the conspiracy is your politician is best at It is also the most childish trick, but unfortunately I am an imperial knight, a general who survived the twilight battle. I only know to swing the sword to all the enemies standing in front of me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustine clap his hands and praise his face with a hypocritical smile: "The imperial knight's declaration, the empire is proud of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Augustine thought thoughtfully, asked "But are you not the Marquis of England? Is it important to be unclean, or is justice more serious?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of England is cold and cold: "Don't hold with one The father of the son’s head talked about honor and justice, and the little politician who came out of Luo Tong’s.” The Marquis of England and the big bone toy in front of Augustine, Sayuri. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shortcoming of the undead is that you lose the flexibility after losing your soul. The advantage of this is that there is no general fear, such as the instinct for physical injury. To avoid, the undead can do the act of killing the enemy and then being cut into two, and normal humans, especially the Marquis who climbed to the position of the Dragon Knight, could not do it, even if he was a father immersed in sorrow. No exception. So the mature king of the lion can defeat Sayuri, but it is not easy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to wait, I have friends to come." Augustine said a word that was not marginal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of England is not a minor in the Master profession, but any knight who has been killed by the Master on the battlefield has a corresponding perception, so he retreats decisively, almost At the same time, the room appeared a magical array similar to the summoning system, and Sayuri still stood between Augustine and the Lion King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no more docile and loyal servant in the world than the undead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vow, money, honor, no temptation to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin squats and presses his hand on the hub of a magical array symbolizing the "key", the sky is skyrocketing, a loli figure appears in the air, and two The later generation was praised by the heresy as a powerful doll of the "Lich King". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of England’s eyes widened, apparently summoned by this nondescript to a slight shock, because the summoning magic must be forced from another plane to the creature or soul. This is a very basic magical common sense. The Marquis of the Dragon Knight has never heard of the fact that humans of the same plane can be transported in two places. This is a miracle. The Marquis of England, who is well versed in military strategy, was not thinking about how to make quick decisions, but to solve the murderers who trampled on the Todd family's honour. Instead, he envisioned a magical array that would lead to the border between the south and the Titans in various empire states. Then there is a huge possibility that the Holy Empire will have an unparalleled horrific mobility overnight in the epic continent and even the whole world. The eyes of the Marquis of England have a near-fanatic attachment, staring at Augustine. The corners of the mouth hidden behind the mask are squirming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lion King, I can continue to summon two gold subspecies, do you want to enjoy this wonderful picture?" Augustine grinned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are 1,200 knights under the castle. Who do you think is better? Who can live out of the Ascott Manor?" Marquis sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, then wait until you take my head to the city of Judah to greet the emperor’s anger and let Todd’s immediate members’ heads fall together. The head was first landed." Augustine spread his hand and said easily. "You see, I didn't plan to escape. I just wanted everyone to sit down and talk. Now it's still the case, as long as you are willing to let go of that head and take back the sword. I can pour two glasses of wine and resolve today's misunderstanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
