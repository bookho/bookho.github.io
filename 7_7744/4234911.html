This is legal and highly praised by the Knights Union. It is impossible to challenge the magician and the Arcane, but between the latter two. It is also strictly forbidden to compete with each other privately. Once discovered, the certificates and badges that have been officially recognized will be taken back. Because the Master is recognized as the most important and cherished "Prince" of Judit, so few people can see the Master on the battlefield. The wonderful performance, so when everyone "baths" in the holy light, in addition to marvel, there are fears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redemption. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a term that is only used in the high-level trials of the Inquisition. No bishop dares to replace the Lord to easily say this sacred vocabulary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiance is as slowly and steadily as the tides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clockwork orange customers are finally able to open their eyes, the young man who came to the miracle on the scene is still standing before Hera Bolsefele However, the mysterious wand that was originally mistaken for the inferior black crystal ball has been pulled out. In the eyes of everyone, it is a burly man lying on the marble floor, losing most of his life signs, only occasionally twitching, the other end. The most striking gold-colored long hair is almost completely burned by the "light", and the most shocking thing is that the remaining red magic ball still stays above the loser's head, as if the young magician's hand is gently pressed. It will explode the head of the Helen kitten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looked up again and looked at the aristocratic young master of the Helen family. It was a little small and unexpected. The upstairs was more old than some of the emperor. The slim and handsome young man of the aristocratic malformed taste has a smile on his face. It is not a big family that has been passed down for more than three generations. He can't cultivate such a heavy mask. Augustine smiled and waited quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Helen family heirs were placed on the chest with one hand and slightly turned around and turned away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not start a war on the table with any powerful person. This is one of the ancient family trainings of the Helen family, so the feminine youth chooses to take a step back. The old family’s mouthfuls of lively family history tells him that taking a step back is often a good premise for two steps forward. After withdrawing from the crowd, he tells the private butler who is always silent, Douglas. Orange said that we are still willing to pay 1.5 million Caesar gold coins, and the two heres are handed over to the friend of the sacrament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, Master Hugo." The middle-aged butler was stalking and went to the Earl of Marseille to convey the will of the Helen family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the charred kitten Gordon, the middle-aged gentleman like an elegant poet would not be naive to ask Hugo’s intentions, 1.5 million Caesar The vacancy of the gold coin is enough to make the owner of the unstable family in Helen's roots bear the accusation of the family council. Maybe it will have to be taken out from the owner's own pocket. Gordon is also an indispensable important role. It is impossible to abandon a piece of chess whose identity is a "hunter". The middle-aged housekeeper bypassed the Greenspan family, who was generally gloating, and went to the hesitant face of Marseille, who looked down on the eccentric "friends" downstairs. Friends who can be on the master list, there is not yet a good one. End. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really the old-fashioned carriage outside the Alfa city, not yet forgetting to sneak into the impolite man in the dusty? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice in the barbarians Greenspan family has always been regarded as a treasure by the old Marquis, and the original unpleasantness is swept away, replaced by small A small sneak peek, she picked up her heels and squatted on the railing, regardless of the name of the celebrity. Looking at the man who was in her heart in the past, listening to the old Carver, muttering to herself, Miss Alice was happy. Even more than the news that Aunt Kunding sent the mechanical long-tailed black cane, after all, the Greenspan men around her are mostly well-deserved "barbaric", and the calm and calmness of the man downstairs is almost like A real aristocrat who grew up in an ancient family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, is he strong?" Alice asked with a smile, turning to look at the old Carver who finally recovered from meditation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Carver praised, "But his power is not The appearance that Miss Alice saw, creating a large area of ​​holy 'redemption', is not difficult for any 15th-level or more arcane artist, and his truly aggressive skills are just hidden in this' "Redemption", or I can say that the so-called Holy Light is just a gorgeous smoke bomb, solemnly concealing his cruelty, I am afraid that only a few people can see the damage suffered by men in the magical array, I know, Miss Alice, I am sure that he is just a magician with a nuclear power capacity of up to 9 high-level. This is what he really is awesome. Imagine that when he expands the nuclear capacity, then he has 50 in his hand. + Magic, what kind of smashing? Miss Alice, forgive the old Carver for using the slick words of 'smashing' to describe rigorous magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is he really an arcadeist above level 15?" Alice was curious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, his light is a 'real illusion' and does not cause substantial harm, otherwise most of the unclean false believers in the clockwork orange It will be seriously injured. And the empire does not have such a young arcane, St. Jerome said two years ago, a child he hoped for, gave up the road to become a 16+ Arcane sage before the age of 30. "Old Carver regrets that when he reaches this level of magician, he often blurs the boundary between the magician and the arcane. He is no longer as hostile to the arcane as the young magician. The old man sees Alice without a face, and squeezes out a The smile of old and awkward, "The so-called 'real illusion' refers to the lucky one who succeeded in making Alice's heart beat. Once there is ample nuclear power, it can "cure" and "salvage" the Holy Light. The great secrets are beyond the imagination, and such lucky ones, in addition to being worthy of being valued by Alice, should be thrown into the 'torch' for further study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alice’s face was reddish, but she did not deny that she was the lucky one. Special vision, she has been a good boy not good liars. As for who is the genius Arcane master who is being seen by Saint Jerome, she does not expect it at all. For the flowers of Greenspan, whose thoughts are not complicated, the great men of the empire, the young knights who received the medals in the jihad, For her, it is a meaningless existence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Helen family, which should have been the absolute protagonist, took the lead in developing the orange, and the Earl of Marseille wiped the sweat and praised the Helen family’s courage in the bottom of his heart. In the embarrassing situation, you can pay the bills generously. It is worthy of the "protective god of dirty money" Helen, the Earl of Marseille is forced to hold the impulse to give Hailun housekeeper Douglas a 10% discount, 1.5 million Caesar gold coins, 10% off means Losing 150,000 Caesar gold coins, Count Marseille is distressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fortunately, reason has overcome the face." Earl of Marseille was proud to show that his men could evacuate the clockwork orange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will have to be careful to wait for the big man in the ministry downstairs. In the eyes of the imperial aristocracy, any duke or real marquis is worthy of flattering. But you can curse them while bending over, even imagine the beautiful picture of their pretty lady breathing under their own body, but if a secret person in the Ministry of the Ministry who is qualified to act alone, everyone should temporarily put away arrogance, Greed and love - desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Greenspan family also leaving the development of the orange, the land aristocrats and merchant bankers also left the auction house, and finally left the Solomon knife assassin The master, a mediocre middle-aged man, seemed to hesitate before he left the scene to indirectly show his way to the powerful ministry. He eventually dismissed the thought and quietly left the servant with a stereotype. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Decarr is dead?" Hera Bolsefele looked at the great knight who was nailed into the crystal chandelier. His eyes were sad. He seemed to be asking Augustine, and he was as powerless as himself. The powerlessness of the clockwork orange today is even heavier than all the frustrations she has on the jihad battlefield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin waved, and Descartes’ body plummeted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't!" On the battlefield, the woman of Zeus, who is as calm as the goddess, exclaimed, after all, the big knight Descartes may have been the last one of her life to see for himself. To the "fool", she still hopes that Descartes can return to the Saxon Forest, fight the empire, and finally die on the battlefield, not in front of this crazy monster. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He is your lover?" Augustine eccentrically laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Descartes's fleshy body suddenly stopped a second before hitting the marble floor, and finally landed slowly, and 21 magic balls began to drop by bit. dissipate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who are you?" Hera did not answer the boring problem. She was born as a jihad and died as a woman when she was educated as a holy war. The Cavaliers, her chosen belief is not a pale love for her, but the same as the Saxon Knights, the choice of the source of the honor of justice, with the help of the sacrifice in the war, for Hera Bolsefele She will never touch the luxuries that the empire hypocrisy knight most likes to put on her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How about making a bet? If I give you an answer that you don’t believe, you become my obedience. On the contrary, you can get free status. Don't doubt the true extent of the latter. I can steal you from a lot of Marceau's aristocratic mouths. Of course, there is also the power to give you freedom. Don't question the gold content of a consul's 'redemption'." Augustine laughs. Laughing, giving a very bold choice, so beautiful, so that people can not believe, see each other looking at the idiot look at themselves, Augustine a little shouted: "I am serious, if you do not grasp it I will treat you directly as my private doll."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you give an answer that I can't believe, I pretend not to Care, do you not necessarily lose this inexplicable gamble?” Hera sneered, the guy in front of him completely offended a big family, and then opened a boring gamble that does not require much IQ to support, really Crazy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that you are a moral gambler, like a gambler like me." Augustine laughed haha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herrah stunned and seemed hesitant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth yelled at the side: "I am finished, poor Hera Knight, if you choose to believe this kind of vow to be a prostitute, then If you have a gambling result, you will lose a little. If you deal with a woman, this coward is not like a chick that has only lived for more than 20 years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hera Bolsefele has no room for choice at all. The man in front is just throwing a choice that is more friendly than the ground. After confirming that there is no obvious trap, she sighs: "I Promise you, with the honor of the knight's honour, not to repent of all the consequences. You can say, who are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vatican 4 seats in the big executive." Augustine approached her whisper, still one meter is about to lean on her body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archon, not the Archon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Justice of the Inquisition, but there are only three big executives, which is the fourth? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera-Bolsefoll’s unspeakable face was shocked, and then replaced with cold ridicule, it was a despicable guy, in exchange for himself The belief, such an obvious lie, simply cannot allow Hera to surrender her faith. Even if the gambling has been established, this is the natural pride of a knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is one step closer, already close to the sealed female knight, in her ear: "That is just my new identity, Judith the Great It was only two months before the Vatican Tigang went through a war that could not see the smoke, but it is estimated that all the great aristocrats of the empire are now aware that the news of the Saxon Forest is so incomprehensible? My name is Augustine Rothschild, the first heir to the family of the traitor Rotongschild."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hella receded In two steps, the finger pierces the palm of his hand again, staring at the man in front of him, as if he wants to seek a real answer from his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is real, Hera tells her from the instinct of error. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that you have lost, you want to fight with Rotongschild."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin walked over, his face was a bit abnormal, pinching He Pulling the exquisite chin, Shen Sheng said: "Become my embarrassment, you will understand the fool who fights with Luo Tongchaid, what kind of end will happen, you are not the first one, not the last one!" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herba-Boer Sefele, who is known for her calmness, spit a slobber on Augustine’s face, suddenly screaming and laughing, waiting for the sable flower inheritance The anger is angry, she is ready to bear all the upcoming storms, but after she smiles dumbly, she finds that he has no attempt to wipe. She converges with laughter and sneers: "The powerful Grand Archon, I am not A moral gambler, I am just a knight who fights for faith in Saxon Forest, and there is no honor in my belief dictionary, only 'justice' and 'sacrifice'!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin finally reached out and slowly wiped his face with blood Silky saliva, slowly said: "It’s a slick reply than politicians, but I like to deal with such smart enemies."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head toward the station The Earl of Marseille, who was afraid to approach in the distance, smiled and said: "Respected Earl of Marseille, please help me prepare a spacious carriage, the kind of velvet bedding, must guarantee that I can’t feel this beautiful heresy. The bumps of the road, maybe you don't know, this is actually one of the rulings of the sacrament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stunned Earl of Marseille immediately turned and ran out to buy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrament is terrible, too dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder no one is willing to go in and "talk about doctrine." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Marse thought that he was naked and was pressed by a stranger on the sheet of the carriage, and he was a goosebump, and the fat body broke out with amazing energy. For a time, the big man in the sacrament was sent away. Miss Elizabeth, who was a bit boring, jumped out of the chair and hid the dark gold dagger. She did not forget to wrap a lot of food and wine with the tablecloth, then walked over to the Descartes Knight, bent over and caught the big unexplained life. The knight's hair, just like rubbish, dragged the big heresy out of the clockwork orange auction hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Hera-Boer Sefele was put on the shoulder by Augustine, she finally got a red eye and then violently choked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
