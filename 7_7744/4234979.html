			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bypass the Dagangmen Square, which is still selling Nero’s fine confession letters, the carriage slowly travels out of the main road and rushes to the northeast of the Imperial City. St. Carroll's School of Magic, unlike the open style of the nearby Morgan Street Knights College in Dayantong District, no noble carriages are allowed to enter the college, as today is the deadline for reporting dates, and the carriages parked in the two rows of streets are very dense. It was a big gathering of imperial aristocrats, and their carriages could only stop at the Tulip Street, which is still some distance away from the Magic Academy. The two ladies left their contact information and expressed their gratitude, and they could not jump into the car and rushed to the car. Registration office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Otto of the Rothschild family mentioned in "The Eyes of the Blind", Augustine carries a servant whom Ms. Mena has never seen, slow Take a slow walk to St. Carroll College, because the torch organization that gathered the Imperial Magic Day next door has a friend of hiss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic, has always been more natural than the Cavaliers profession to exclude civilians, because it requires the support of Caesar gold coins and system education, just through special channels to buy magic books and hire The cost of a private magic teacher has discouraged some wealthy civilian families, and once they become magicians, it is an unpredictable key to returning a risky effort. The price is proportional to the quality of the material. Inexplicable but indispensable magical experimental materials, an entry magic wand that is cheaper and requires nearly a hundred Caesar gold coins. There will always be one reason for burning money. The magicians who choose this path will go to the headache, and the Empire attaches importance to it. It is a fact to be kind to the magician, but most of the expenses still need to be undertaken by the magician himself, especially those magicians whose talents are not outstanding. This is a steep pyramid that is hard to stand on the climb, and can finally stand tall. The character in the position is, after all, a lucky one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young magician, need a good magic wand with cheap beauty?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Handsome The young master, with your eagerness to learn, you will need several limited edition precious books like Cambridge Magic Encyclopedia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way, Augustine was When the trainee magician who came to report was hired, the hawker who was good at drilling camps went to buy some flashy pirated books and fake and magical props. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike him and the pair of Mena mothers and daughters, most of the students who come here, besides their parents, will be accompanied by a senior magician employed by the family. There is no shortage of where to get a respected tulip magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evening, a carriage pulled by four Ulm horses stopped directly at the door of St. Carroll College. With the support of the female etiquette instructors, she walked down a blonde girl who would hang her arrogance on her face and dress up. It’s not like coming to the college to report, but to attend a large dinner. The humble young priest glanced at the badge, which is famous for the no-famous glory badge. Just imagine that Jupiter has a big tongtong street and an empire with a badge named after the glory. It is easy to know that this is a The ancient and long-lasting family, Becky, the only aristocrat who maintains a pure military aristocratic identity, not only in Jupiter, but also in the entire empire belongs to the top 20 family, it is no wonder that this lady is very likely I missed the check-in time, so I was so anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin can hold out a good white crystal magic wand because he holds an insider, the guardian of the highest imperial magic is not blocked, he is in magic Stopped in front of the statue of St. Carol, one of the three gods. This god is not one of the twenty-four deputy gods of the Temple of the Olympia, but it is the highest god in the mind of the magician. It is closed. A sight, symbolizing the ignorance of everything that has nothing to do with magic. Opening a glance means gazing at all believers in the world. Augustine sighed and continued on. The "Torch" had an unwritten rule for nearly a hundred years. The main gate was closed forever, because the sacred empire of the most prolific magician had one of the greatest shame, that is, the Mayan Snow Mountain Temple has been from the past 100 years. The door was not opened to the imperial magician, so the torch leaders insisted that unless the torch came out of a magician who walked into the foothills of the Michelle, the door would be opened to warn each torchbearer. Nowadays, with the "witch" Gaka wonderfully going to the snowy mountains, the Empire firmly believes that the main entrance of the torch is about to open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The torch side door in St. Carroll College, through a private park with a beautiful view, where each of the magicians who entered the Mayan temple statue. Augustine went to the park after asking, but before that, I accidentally saw a familiar figure sitting on the ladder outside the main building, buried my head in my knees, seemed to be crying, and sitting next to me. The sad lady is the mother-in-law of Richelieu who loves Homer's Epic. Augustine changed the path and walked up the ladder and asked softly: "Mrs, what's wrong? Miss Thales missed the report?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady who has been busy comforting her daughter looked up at the friendly priest who bent slightly, tried to hide some of the panic and distress caused by bad luck, and stood up and bitterly "It was just the time to catch up with the check-in time, but it was squeezed by a lady living in Jupiter City. No matter how we ask the college, St. Carroll is not willing to accept our explanation."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine frowned and asked, "Is that a noble lady from the Beffin family?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady snorted and nodded. Miss, who wears the glory badge, how can they protest from the small aristocrats from the province of Richelieu? It is not good to say that her Lilith is always rejected by the Imperial Magic Guild, and even bring a disaster to the family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest who has been very gentle has asked a question that seems to have nothing to do with the current predicament: "Madam, you can give "The Blind Eyes" "I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Always carry a smile on the lady who carries the poems, maximizing the style of an elegant woman, handing the books to Augustine with both hands, sincerely: "Of course there is no problem, I hope that more people like the first reading of Homer's Epic in our province of Richelieu, and we have not yet repaid you for bringing us the kindness of Saint-Carroll. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin took the poetry collection, bowed his head and cried red, and looked at his own Miss Lithisi, laughing: "Do not worry, I promise holy card." Lor will not miss a scholar like Miss Talis. Please stay with Journey in Jupiter for a day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady was surprised and moved : "Would you like to pay such selflessness?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her question is very good Righteousness, like it or not is to ask, rather than the ability to do. This is the precious quality that a noble lady should have. Augustine smiled and said: "Because I am a magician, I will be with my wife on the road in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss. Curious asked a question that the mother had quietly blinked: "Can you tell me what badge you received from the Imperial Magic Union? Perennial, or Violet?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustine does not care about this kind of playful curiosity. He asks: "What badge does Miss Talis have hoped for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is thinking that the world is After the dilemma of the last day, the first smile appeared. "I hope it is a sword daisy. Of course, the tulip is better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin laughed and prepared to go to Kraft first. The family's mansion, wanting to come to the vampire count does not mind an extra episode in his decades of absurdity. But Augustine has been able to imagine the old count's eccentric eyes on the mother and daughter, they will be treated as their mistress, mother and daughter? More in line with the abnormal taste of the old man's young age. Augustine was just about to say goodbye to the pair of Lisele, who was in the imperial power of the emperor. At the top of the ladder, there was a blond lady who was more arrogant than her feet. The hands were round and the chest was condescending and sneered: "Two from Li The hens in the county of Serre County are still not coming out of Jupiter City. I don’t welcome you in this out-of-town poverty. My patience is limited, count to ten, if the hens are not noble. Miss Bohemian disappeared in sight, and I let your despicable family roll out of the empire from Richelieu!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine is not at all surprised. The grandeur's accent is always creating miracles. Unfortunately, no one specializes in publishing a nobility quotation, otherwise it will sell well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The docile but not timid Miss Thales is very angry, she has a red face and wants to yell loudly, but she is stopped by the calm mother, who Mother, just gently patted her daughter's elegant dress with squatting and stained with some dust. She might not be able to fight with a lady who had a glory badge but was not educated, but did not prevent her from still maintaining Mei at the last moment. The basic conservation of women in the Na family. She will walk out of St. Carroll College quietly, and will never get out, and the family she lives in, even if she is really driven out of the empire by Baffin, will still remain elegant for centuries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the lady’s little gesture, Augustine’s eyes with a collection of poems are soft, and I breathe a little, and I am proud of being surrounded by a bunch of Beverly family. Sneerly said: "This Miss Bohemian, is your father the Emperor's Majesty? Otherwise I really don't know which lady dared to say such irresponsible words. I am from the two provinces of Richelieu Province. Ms., I am sure that it is the real name of the empire, but you can be like a hen who is barely dressed in clothes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The young lady of the Beffin family is not a descendant of the pure military family. She directly orders a Gyantsa family to marry the knight: "Gott, to smash the mouth of this unspeakable person, I don't want to see him again." There is also a tooth in it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not waiting for a private magic teacher wearing a six-petal tulip badge around her, the big knight walked down the ladder. Bring a huge sense of suffocation to Mena's mother and daughter. The Cavaliers, especially the true knights who are qualified to wear the Knights Medal of Honor, rather than those who do not have the right to wear medals below the 10th level, are actually not the warlords in the orthodox sense of the aristocracy. The deterrent power to ordinary people is undoubtedly terrible. But Augustine didn't let this boring show last for a long time. He didn't need him to order. When the twilight of the twilight faded, the strength would skyrocket. The dark servant Dimitt slowly stepped on the ladder and greeted the one who was pampered in the Beffin family. The 12th-level knight who had not participated in the real war for many years, in Dimitt, broke the fragile neck of the big knight on the verge of death, and an old magician who just walked out of the main building of the college and passed the ladder: "Don't you know that there is absolutely no military dispute in San Carlo?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Bohemia’s mouth twitched, disdainful, stretched out The root finger refers to the gloxinia badge on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-class leader who had to adapt to the aristocratic rules, like most magicians in the emperor, changed his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her private magic teacher who served as a high in the Imperial Magic Guild coughed at the right time, his one is only one line away from the highest level of the Imperial Magic Black Orchid badge. The information brought by the six-petal tulip is equally significant. He is not as arrogant as a private student, but it is fatal when he says it: "The priest holds a magic wand at the sigh level. I believe that if it is not a torch member, All have violated the rules of the Imperial Magic Union."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only a magic wand that the tulip magician is qualified to control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Talis was shocked to open her mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mrs. Please take Miss Chris to leave St. Carol first." Augustine smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can indeed solve all the problems at hand, and it is not a problem, but it is not a problem, but it is more difficult than the beneficiary’s heirs in front of the mother and daughter. Augustine does not want to drag the Mena family, which is related to the Rothschild family to only one poem, into an unfathomable political vortex. Kraft and Pompey can be indifferent, but no family in Richelieu Province can afford it. Start. He knows better than anyone else that the greatest happiness of a small and medium-sized aristocrat is to have a calm and abundant manor and live a calm and stable life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the lady shook her head and was very firm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is soft but not easy to resist: "Please believe me, madam."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She finally Still take the daughter's hand and leave San Carlo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believes that this is still a strange unknown priest, just as she believes that the Augustine Master mentioned in Homer's Epic is a devout The priest, the truly noble aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the Miss Buffin family is willing to leave the college for the woman in the province of Richelieu, but because the private magic teacher gave her a negative look, for this She is still respected by the highly respected Emperor Magic Union. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
