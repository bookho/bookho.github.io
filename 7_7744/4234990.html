			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 92<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very plain meeting, very gentle distinction. One is the box Q that triggered the fourteenth miracle of the epic continent. One is the secret summoning of the sacramental giant of St. Urban, and the mediocre singer of the mediocre can not afford the harp, as long as this pair of men and women The protagonist can sing a story that appeals to the audience. The audience will also expect to shine a dazzling spark, but the truth is the opposite. Augustine will soon leave the Big Ben, and the young woman will bend over and look through the scope. It seems that there is no more story than a conversation that is fairly harmonious. "The Shadow of the Queen" The Red Archbishop Phoenician and the "Vesari Great Scepter" Duke successively walked into the clock tower. The National Astronomical Observatory, as she said, was fully sponsored by the royal family and did not ask the imperial finances and local nobles. A copper plate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest’s slogan has the roughness of a typical card martial artist, grinning: "Your Majesty, it looks like the son of the Rotongschild family, Not at all like his ancestors, more like a court poet. His exquisite signature on the document really envied me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen retracted her sight, Go to a mahogany round desk filled with books like "The Eternal Eternity", which is similar to Diggs and his son. There are two sheepskin nautical charts on the desk, one old and yellow, one relatively new. The former is a treasure map from a Viking pirate's head pocket that was hanged on a gallows. The latter was depicted by a navigator funded by the Kamo royal family. The most conspicuous pattern is of course named by her. The New World of the British Isles chain. She stretched out a finger from the port of Kami Joseph and slid to the chain of islands. She smiled and said: "Let Philippi go to deal with a quill, it is really difficult for our Visari ice wolf king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged duke slammed his hand and touched his big bald head, and the aged red archbishop smiled kindly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen’s voice reluctantly said: “I thought that the descendants of this traitor are a good entry point for the huge body of the Holy Empire. It seems that I underestimated his loyalty, card. It’s wonderful to have a big aristocrat who wants to borrow money from her daughter’s dowry than the Duke. It’s not surprising that they have a devout priest who would rather walk alone. Although he is very cautious, he still reveals some interesting things, the Holy Empire these years. The emphasis on the sea is much more than I expected. When I said the moon clock and the sea theodolite, he concealed it very well, but the astronomy lover ignored the point, the correct mood was awkward, not calm. Greenwich The old professors who studied the halftones of the angel scale should be like this, not to mention an ordinary astronomy enthusiast."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Philippians looked at the Queen, and quietly made a gesture of wiping the neck, a look of inquiries. This novel gesture, which has only recently spread in the card, is definitely not a good sign for the epic continent. It first appeared on the battlefield of the latest bell fortress, when a black and heavy armor is like the same stock. The black tide rushed out of the wall of the mourners, and the Queen of Wonders made this gesture when she was sent off by a number of Duke generals. Soon, this vivid gesture spread throughout the empire. A gorse historian suggested to the apostle poker dealers in the new war chronicle that the next card queen could use this one. Dirty, bloody and vulgar gestures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman smiled and shook her head. "We are not worshipping the Austrian Holy See."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duke Silent. For Kamo, Byzantine was once a spiritual godfather, but now it is no different from a slut. At first everyone did not believe that a young woman plus an escaped old man could win this spiritual war, but it turned out that the box Q and the black emperor easily won the victory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen said: "Vesari, waiting for our iron horse to sweep the scroll of the Austrian-Hungarian Federation, who dared to threaten us at the Gorge Conference. Your shawl should be changed. Say something in your heart, and you are really guilty of damaging the face of the emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke touched the bald head with one hand laugh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Archbishop Phoenician whispered: "Your Majesty, Dr. Saxon is waiting for you at the Cathedral."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen nodded, rolled up the parchment, and said goodbye to the Duke and walked out of the clock tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duke bowed his head and meditated, devout and solemn, no one can smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only four words: "My king is immortal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ice and snow empire, whether it is a glorious battle The warrior who died on the battlefield, or the old man who died peacefully in the bed, will meditate on these four words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The town is not far from the old emperor. When the Queen and the entourage entered the Arctic Bell Cathedral, the ambassador of the Holy Empire just entered the county of Perotti. Along the way, the Earl of Foreign Affairs, Earl Ibn, changed his attitude toward Augustine by 180 degrees. He was as diligent as serving the foreign prime minister of the boss, and the members of the ambassador’s ambassador’s team felt inexplicable. They naturally could not know the poor Earl. Not long ago, I received a stern letter from the emperor, and it is very likely that the count will be able to make the diplomatic glory of the card. Fortunately, the young assistants did not show much arrogance that was not close to human feelings, and made Earl Ibn a lot of peace of mind. In fact, Augustine really did not care for such an episode that did not affect the overall situation. He searched for him from the Grizzlies. There are countless nobles and nobles who are looking for fun. The tentacles of order are far from flourishing enough to spread into Jupiter City, the Chief Secretary of State for Academic Affairs, the Duke of Todd, the Condid family, and so on. There are too many close-ups. Make sure the enemy needs him to deal with it. On the Marceau border, Augustine took the lead to leave the ambassador. This time, Count Ibn did not stop, and personally led a large group of Templars to see him off until the shabby carriage with the gold balance badge disappeared completely into the field of vision, Count Ibn Only a heavy sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two battles trampled on the black Swan Lake Manor, the original scenery was no longer the same. Without the start of the debut, the God’s left eye magic array was gradually repaired in the busy process of the Cannonmasters, and it was carried out on the original basis. With the expansion, there is no inhabitation of the black Mamba king snake in the lake. The lakeside began to build a strange building destined to towering in accordance with the drawings hand-painted by the Archon, and it was a foundation to dig up countless soils. They also heard that the edge of the manor to build an arena, the cheap low-level knights from the slave market, although very hard, but at least have basic security and survival protection, so there is no complaint, and who dares? The order is long, but you are the new giant of the Holy See! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the poetry songs, everything is step by step on the right track, there are two things that make Augustine back to the castle feel good, one is Markham Before the appointment, the Archbishop personally sent the first batch of "semi-political and semi-religious contributions". The Marceau nobles who were unfortunately hit by the Grand Executive in the Mississippi Arena were screamed by the fat pig, which made the poetry song castle More than 600,000 yuan of financial revenue, guiding the women and madness of the money than the reciting of the code of more pious and hard-working Marmac pigs still left a promise, the second batch of Caesar gold coins delivered within six months at the latest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second piece is the code-loaded by the artificial sun--Gand Hughes convinced a marquis-class breeder in the Marshall family to come together The Song Castle chose to carry out the second holy hibernation in the long life at the bottom of the cemetery, but because Augustine went to the emperor and made the card wonderful, the two high-end long-lived species had to stay quietly nearby, and did not dare to make a point. Over the moment, after the order was long, Marquis Marshall quickly converges to the inappropriate boring arrogance, more humble than the Marquis of the Code, because the first time he met, he smelled the darkness of a prince-class prince. In the history of darkness, in some sense, because of the power, the sect of the genocide has always been an horror than the Marquis of the rest of the race, Prince of Setters? Almost comparable to the true ancestors of the twelve races! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cemetery inhabited by St. Urban in the bottom of the castle is like a pure and pure brilliance. This breath is not sacred, nor moves to the dark, pure and clear. Therefore, Marshall Marquis, who was bathed in the light for the first time, is very hot. For the long-lived species, the dragon veins adjacent to the dragon have the advantage of a natural barrier, and the flames and frosts are good for dormancy. The dark trenches that rest in peace below 10,000 meters are even more isolated from the world. These two places are excellent places for hibernation, but they can't easily try without the strength of the true ancestors and the princes. This cemetery is the holy land of any Marquis-class ancestors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the order of the Lord, please allow the Marshall family to take the liberty. I will send a sincere invitation to the allies." Earl Marshall made a snap. A golden bat fluttered out of the cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin did not refuse and block, and Dimit and the guests of the two poems entered the blood tombstone to sleep, left the cemetery, walked into the honey nest, a corner With the giant eggs of the golden double-headed pheasant, several cracks are faintly visible, and the little guy is about to break out of the shell. Miss Elizabeth reminded that after the birth of the golden dragonfly, most of the egg shells can be regarded as excellent. Bait, but can leave part of the experimental material as a shofar, or used as a precious magical array material, can almost increase the magical array energy, Augustine sits against the wall, in silence, the consulmaster squats and sways "Lullaby". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few paragraphs, Augustine turned his head and looked at the golden egg, reaching out and touching the fetal movement of the little thing inside the egg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get up and walk into the private room of Lolita butler, covered with Caesar gold coins, maybe it’s anxious, crystal cream on the dresser, gorse foundation, etc. Her hard-collected favorite items didn't have time to move away. Augustine sat in the chair in front of the dressing table and cleaned up the messy table. It was put into the drawer and placed in the drawer, which was neatly arranged on the table, then stacked. A good bed, picking up some littered socks and princess dresses, put them in the closet, and by the way, throw away some expired snacks that she secretly hid in the goose downs. Finally, Augustine came to the row of glass bottles and stopped at that In front of the glass box she called "Lady Little Secret", Augustine could even hear the sorrowful soul mourning inside. This room is half of the Princess of Melvina and half of the bloody queen. Once, she asked Augustin seriously. Are you? Like half of the abomination, Augustine was busy praying and did not answer, now one is in the Holy Empire, one is on the Muse mainland, I don’t know if she asks him to answer this question next time, need more . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the honey nest, rising in turn, only paused in the study halfway, finally came to the cat's eye at the bottom of Swan Lake, Pandora sat next to the harp, a Gothic The black hair is like the most delicate string. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin was in front of her, holding her hand and apologizing: "This harp is too late for a long time."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The daughter of the empire’s biggest traitor smiled a little, and it’s hard to imagine that the most embarrassing men of the two generations of empire have educated such a docile female heir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine did not miss the trip to the emperor and the card, and ended up with an encounter with Randolph, the Queen of Cards. "She reminds me of another woman in the story, the young and beautiful woman. The Queen of Wonders later went to the throne and went to the top of the Kingdom of England at the age of twenty-five. In order to consolidate the throne, the latitude and longitude between the two powerful empires at that time gave up the marriage and eventually ended up as an old virgin, but In exchange for the rise of her kingdom, in exchange for a day without falling into the empire."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pandora whispered: "This is a sad story, right? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin who never took a mask in front of her honestly said: "Is it more accurate to use tragic strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Pandora laughs and doesn't speak, Augustine knows that she doesn't agree with her, but it doesn't matter. It always has a strong strength, even if the Queen of Kosher has to ridicule the younger sister of "sister", you will not be right. The woman is demanding, in this almost Empire hearts of men do not understand, she and Lolita housekeeper, are the two most distinctive presence. Augustine took out the two "Homer's Epics" from His Majesty and handed it to Pandora. He said gently: "This is a wandering story about an old knight. One of my enemies said it would be the most important knight epic of the time. I rarely agree with her."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pandora took the book and put it on his lap, Augustine began to silence, because there was no reason to think of the orderly stocking of the female knight Hera Then, I remembered Nero on the stage of the war, the Krakow family's dragon gun knight house Dawei, and of course the fat man Rhein Hatai. The best war mad men in the empire later came to the war on the border, the queen of the encounter. On one hand, the impoverished empire of the far north land was put into the affluent war, which made the war horse more abundant, the warrior more heroic, and taught the backward empire on the civilized tail how to fight in two lines, and Jupiter the Great, his glory lies in the scorpion The Holy Empire infused a thick blood of war, vigorously cultivated the knights of good warfare, relied on the cultivation of the arcane masters who were more suitable to go to the battlefield, and used the holy war as a scorpion and a training ground. A steady foothold, gave birth to a large number of novel merchants and nobles, war trade bankers, Augustine believes that in the next hundred years, the dual protagonists on the mainland can only be the sacred empire and the card, the only premise is that the successors of the two can be as wise as their predecessors. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred empire and the son of the war on the border of the Titans A grand battle of a total of 350,000 troops was launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of the sacred empire, the lineup was dazzling, the jihadist commander Marquis Pompeii, the head of the army, the Earl of Dürer, the second rank of the Imperial Chief Executive, the Duke of Robert, who had been in the life of the old Monte Cristo, who had been dealing with the Titans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;150,000 warriors who grew up in the war, plus 15,000 wizards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a large number of young commanders who have stood out in the last decade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Titatan’s side, it is a gathering of almost all elite elite soldiers, headed by Prince of Wales, the god of war, Odin, surrounded by the original acquaintance of Otis The "Poet" of the Prince's Black Rose Corps, Friedrich; the young man, who was smuggled from the gorse dynasty to the Titans in his youth, was a blockbuster "Whaling" General Anderson, exactly Mrs. Anderson, until the Titans tried Marry a princess to this indifferent and handsome soldier, only to know that "he" is a woman; the head of the Northern Army, Puff, is the old enemy of the old Monte Cristo, best at the frontal battle, the instantaneous attack defense conversion It is a model of veteran strategists. There are countless admirers on the mainland. Even within the sacred empire, he has to use his military theory as a basic textbook. There is also the Titan's first sacred knight "Silver Cup" Cameron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200,000 troops, five large military groups, plus one is known as the only "red whip" on the mainland that can compete with the same number of cards. The Knights, this is a "God's Whip." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire continent is holding its breath and watching the prelude and trend of this war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to professional soldiers, there are countless bards, war speculators, gold coin politicians and military observers from other countries. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the three youths of the empire, the civilian officers headed by the war star Rommel are scattered among the various legions. It is not surprising that the real surprise is that there are uncles. The Knights of the Aristocrats, including the Prince of China, were also placed on the front line. This team has a large number of young elite knights from Morgan College like the prince and the genius Constantine. This undoubtedly makes the observers firmly believe that the Holy Empire is determined. To win this battle, and the Jupiter emperor seems to imply that the future will be handed over to the prince of Schopenhauer, not another relatively silent and low-key son. As for the last no-name aristocratic knight, no one cares. God knows where the 400-man knights led by the dead fat man are having fun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long border between the two countries. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small and medium-sized knight rushed to a hilly gate where there is no military map. It is far from the Gogol Red Plain, without any strategic value, not only the knight It is difficult to ride through the horses, that is, the infantry is also to be patience and physical strength by the endless mountains and mountains. In the history of the two countries’ wars, no small conflicts have erupted here. The two sides of the border are the poor Sigiriya of the Holy Empire. The province and the Kolb Mountain in Titan, in simple terms, this area is a black area where even the missionaries are not willing to get involved. So what is this Knights who are full of support to "tour"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it’s the Rhein Hatha’s miscellaneous army, everyone is on the move, extremely difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the fat man who was wearing a heavy quality military sergeant was afraid of death, he was carrying grass roots and sweating, followed by four or five 骂骂咧咧The fat man ignored the grievances of the empire's first- and second-line aristocratic heirs. He always pays attention to the news sent by the investigators. He turned his head and looked at the men. They were all a lack of physical strength. They laughed and said, "The bastards are very good at acting." Well, rest in place." The command was conveyed, and a burst of cheers and screams, all sitting on the ground, no one was right, drinking water, squatting, and some unruly oily knights took time to play gambling because of the beluga Most of the fortresses will squander gold coins. At this time, only a few copper plates and a few copper plates will be gambled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man sits on the floor with his knees and spreads a map he has drawn, which is many times more detailed than the military map issued by the Imperial Army. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nobleman of the Orffan family of the Emperor of the Emperor sneaked out a small bottle of beautifully wrapped wine, handed it to the head of the group, and lost the freckled fat man. Appreciative eyes, took a big sip, and then passed it to the number of confidants around him, but once you see who has no eyesight and drink more, he will be kicked by him and eventually return to his own hands. Most of the time, intoxicated blink of an eye, looking down at the map, muttered to himself: "I don't know if the proposal was sent to the Duke's desk, although the Titans really want to beat a frontal battle. The posture, but here is to be infiltrated by this dog chop into two or three thousand sharp-knife warriors, detour, and when the war is fierce, come to a dagger, even if it fails, it is likely to win or lose five or five points. The war situation has become six-four. Don’t underestimate this victory. In the war of nearly 400,000 people, it’s 40,000 lives. Your gangs are not going to be serious. I have to be cautious. If the Titans don’t have this idea, I will give them a surprise, saying There may be a number of medals for this group of bastards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder the slick is so slick that this fat man is a "doodle wholesaler" who can always step on shit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a resentment of the Magus family aristocrats who had been squandered with some wine: "Head of the group, this is a tourist trip, you lie We said that the scenery here is picturesque, there are many beautiful country girls, there is a fart, I don’t even see the mother mountain pig!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Shimper family knight wearing a black beard badge of Bangladesh has nodded and nodded: "The handsome head, your deception has deeply hurt our pure and young mind! I represent the whole group of 432 heroic knights. Seriously protesting to you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty Rheinhatai chewed the grass roots, squinted and squinted, even the explanation was too lazy to explain, and made a comfortable wine cellar. Raised the bloated ass, turned to the blond youth who protested, and put a fart, this is the response of the head of the group. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several aristocratic knights rolled their eyes together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that remains silent is a brown-haired young man who has a beautiful baby face. Unlike most Cavaliers, he was temporarily The family was smashed into the Knights of the Nobels. The temper was weak, and because she was feminine, she suffered a nightmare at the beginning of the group. She was ridiculed by some noble aristocrats. She was almost taken off her pants. Fortunately, the head of the fat group was a bit Conscience, I received a large amount of "educational fees" before coming to the border, which prevented the farce. Later, the young man showed a good overall situation and military literacy in the conversation, and the fat man left him. A small aide, selfishness is nothing more than feeling that this little guy who is said to be a knight is a good-looking, more pleasing than the old subordinates who are slick, and this knight is not the only one that is not integrated with the whole group style. Once I heard that the fat man showed off that he was the person who believed in the Sixth Cavaliers after the imperial court, so Rheinhamtay was willing to tell him something about the Rotunchild family and the young Augustine, and beautiful. Page boy may not be a good preparation knight, but it is a very qualified listener, so soon to be promoted to the empire of the most handsome of the most talented new head of the fat henchmen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights continued their journey after a short break, although the Cavaliers kept yelling at the protests, but everyone knows that no one is really questioning the person. The authority of the head of the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clean-hearted waiter always follows the fat man. In the family, he has heard of the legend of the knight, although he has not witnessed the palace of the Labard crystal. The hall's award ceremony, but compared to the more orthodox and more famous Rommel, the only war monster who won the three titles badge at the same time, he is even more curious about the fat knight who does not ride the Cavaliers, so this is the father's request, joined This famous Knights, the first day to receive a note to the group, the 13 rules, are very weird, such as the third "we are nobles, lost and remember to surrender, can be redeemed, but Don't forget to get a little secret in the hostile camp. This is also a battle. It is ridiculous. Article 8 "Victory is the first honor of the military, go to the fucking knight virtue", too crazy and too elegant. And there is the penultimate article: "Please remember the collective aspirations of our Knights - who can sleep the Princess of Titan, who is the greatest hero", is this a knight or a noble? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very puzzled. He once wanted to withdraw from the Knights until he was insulted by a group of dross aristocrats. He almost took off his pants and stirred up his anger. Then he was given a helping hand by the fat boss, and this was a vengeful stay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, the fat man received a draft of the local map of the scouts, and then they were stitched together by the fat man. The outsiders may not know that the division of labor in the Knights is clear. Basically everyone will have a strict positional arrangement, like the Orfgang family knight who sent the wine next to the fat man is responsible for the logistics and the spoils, and the noble youth wearing the Bengal black tiger badge is responsible for an elite knight. After all, there are a lot of aristocratic heirs here, and the corresponding families will arrange two or three high-level sects. The guy from the Magus family in the southeastern empire is often involved in conspiracy planning because of a bad stomach. This family* is not an eye-catching knight service boy. Because of his good literary accomplishment, he was assigned by the head of the team to the position of data collection and information analysis. This knight regiment seems to be sloppy and undisciplined, but in fact, no one knows exactly what he can do. What can't be done and how much must be done. On top of this bottom line, the fat man Rhein Hatai is no matter if you are secretly bringing wine. It is a violation of the military discipline and mixed with the prostitute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter whispered: "Head, what do you mean by the sharp knife and dagger?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinhatai is commanding a clever scout to go to a certain high point to observe the terrain, smiled back, and put out a fat hand and twisted the ears of a beautiful baby face. "The chick has a good ear. The sharp knife is The elite in the elite, the warrior who can reverse the situation on the battlefield, is the perfect combination of the four professions of the knight swordsman and the assassin bounty hunter. Go back and have a chance to see the manuscript of the paper I wrote to Morgan College. How to create a special team whose sole goal is to kill the enemy's leaders. Unfortunately, the proud and honest Morgan College did not take care of me. Such interesting and practical ideas did not even know the goods, hehe."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter seriously nodded: "It's fun!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man laughed, very satisfied with the attitude of the little waiter, and then some Look lonely: "Our empire is rising too fast, so too much attention In the plain war, the Titans are higher and lower, but the war is just a matter of remembering the winners in a mean way. Where are the rules and regulations, Xiaolun, can you understand this?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waiter nodded, not perfunctory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man squatted down, grabbed a handful of soil, sniffed and looked up and smiled. "Good, after the chick, you also have the chance to become a soldier who often fights with victory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Baby face boy is red, very cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looks into the distance and gently sighs: "You remind me of the young Augustine, who was as handsome and smart, but Master Augustine is more shameless than you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scout ran wildly and breathlessly said: "Head, Titan army, countless people!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatful frowning, Shen Sheng: "Try to give me the most accurate number!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ear, the ankle and the ankle have always been The guy with heavy fat man calmed down and replied: "Only the number of enemy can only be guaranteed at least 2,000!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man thought for a moment and smiled:" Can you estimate 2,000 people, that means at least 5,000 people, almost the same as my worst expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty Rheinham Suddenly got up and said: "Call all the squadron leaders and hold an emergency meeting!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a hill, standing Men and a woman behind a dozen squire wearing all-black Titans famous and rare as heavy armor. The man is in his forties. He is the only one who has not worn a heavy role. His appearance is flat and his temperament is closer to a college professor who has turned a textbook in class. He does not have any badges. The woman's height is consistent with the Titan's generally tall man, nearly 180 centimeters, wearing a sapphire blue, but no helmet, double-handled hilt, blade inserted into the earth, calm face, overlooking the distant view, a dark short hair dancing in the wind The gold-colored giant sword exudes a cold war of war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man squats down and does the same movement as Rhein-Hate, picks up a piece of soil and sniffs, smiles and says: "Mrs, thank you You agree with my combat plan. If it is not your invitation, the highest military meeting will not promise to give me a 'Gagoli statue' in the Red Whip Knights. Without these 800 holy knights, my plan is too porous. Big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman with both hands pressed on the hilt of the golden sword is silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle-aged man who did not get a response ridiculed his nose and said to himself: "We deliberately gave up a little advantage and have successfully lured the heads of the Holy Empire to the Gogol plain, where the mill station near the Beluga Fortress is stationed. The last batch of 6,000 sects who arrived in the group did not have a good Guard of the Knights. We could eat it in one bite, and maybe we could get a little more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The woman coldly said: "The empire for your plan, let out not a little advantage, this advantage is enough for the Holy Empire to make up for the number of 50,000 people, if you return without merit, then you will be the empire Sinner, I will personally send you to the military court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man seems to be a natural optimist, muttering: "'Gagoley statue' Six thousand heroic warriors wearing high anti-magic weights are enough to put the unprepared 6,000-man wizard's head in a row in a row on the Titan spear. Madame, you can rest assured that I will lose. Pulling with you in the back of these imperial elites In the meantime, until the whole team is killed, you have no chance to send me to the military court."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman finally showed a little cold and stiff face Line, whispered: "The empire needs a living 'poet', and the emperor said that a Fried is worthy of a big army. Although Prince William is not in harmony with you, he still agrees that I will escort you to the border, now look Come to the Holy Empire and not notice your plan, then I can return to the battlefield that belongs to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden sword with war fame second only to Odin The "Mrs." turned and left without hesitation, alone and only. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The temperamental middle-aged man is reluctant to leave her alone and sigh. In the squad of the Titan Empire, which was severely deformed, he was the only foreigner who won the respect of the successful superiors. The bitterness of the squad can be written into a personal biography of the old army, "Flowers and Blood", but who is going to say Most admire the "poet", that is, Mrs. Anderson, who is also an outsider, the giant sword in her hand, the producer can not be verified in detail, probably from the goldsmith of the Byzantine Holy See, mimicking the Holy Grail of the Monastery of San Juan, Called "The Voice of Silence", the Gullan inscription on the blade has different translations: "Giving to the extraordinary person who brings glory", "The Lord of Prosperity." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the empire knows that he has a crush on the lady, but she said that she will only marry the bravest man on the mainland, for this vaguely ambiguous statement. Everyone doesn't understand much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recollecting the thoughts, the "poet" Fried, who had blossomed in the era of the Prince of Australia, conveyed the order to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relatives of the old emperor called this a indeed scholar of the "Klimm Palace Werewolf", which shows the height of Friede in the Titan Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the contradiction between the poet and the werewolf, Fried, feels that it is easy to take off the heart of the sacred empire, and as such, may be away from that The so-called courage of the lady is closer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hidden secret on the road is just a sacred empire knights with a number of people and individual combat capabilities. It seems that this is a disparity. Suddenly confrontation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfortunate Knights contracted the formation at the fastest speed, but this time it did not retreat as usual, but all in the middle The tops gathered together to start the meeting. The fat man Rheinhamtai calmly said: "More than 5,000 people, all of them are composed of the most powerful fighters of the Titans. The strength is 1 to 10. The only advantage we have is the opposite. I didn’t find our whereabouts. I’m sorry to tell you that this escape is not realistic. The opposite goal is not the high-level think tank of the second echelon of the Beluga Fortress, or the 6,000-member Master of the Mill’s station. What’s more, we are letting In addition to conveying this news, it seems that we still have to know that we have been dragging this group of Titans for at least six days. Now our situation is that we have escaped and have half the chance to live, but the main battlefield is betting on the sacred empire for ten years. The big force of material resources will be lost, and the loss will be very bad. Of course, after we sneak back, we will bear a little bit of nickname. Anyway, we are born with a thick skin, what are we afraid of? Right?"<br /><br /> &nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aristocratic young knights with an average age of only 23 years old smiled, but they were stubborn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty wiped his face, spread a dozen pieces of scattered map drafts on the ground, pointed at the branches, and continued: "Oh, remember We still have a small advantage, that is, we are more familiar with the jungle war than this group of thieves. Don't forget, we are all honor knights who came out of the holy war, and if anyone would like to die with me, I think You can avoid the frontal battle, get out of a curve, bite them on the side, hit and pull, then circle, and then smash a few pieces of meat, can consume a few pieces of chop, but I don’t have much confidence to play. Winning this calculation is a battle that must be lost. So I will tell you clearly now, to escape, hurry, don’t fuck here, smirk and listen to my nonsense, and don’t think I will look down on you, if not Laozi is an empire. The most handsome leader in the history of the Knights, the first to run the road, well, just said that if you want to go, you can leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;More than 30 young people face each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty refers to one of the aristocratic youths, seriously: "Broude, you are the eldest son of the family, and will soon marry the beautiful lady, You will roll me right away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pointed to another one, "Pruger, you are the knight of Morgan College to be thrown into the postgraduate. Also roll."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You, Bran, Laozi is the most annoying, you licked a sword and snot a lot of tears, all his mother rubbed in Laozi On the body, you also give me a roll!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bunch of quick names and dozens of points, and finally the fat man looked at the baby face knight boy around him, the tone is slightly softer. "And you, Columbine, just a waiter, don't need to do stupid things to sacrifice for the country, this kind of thing is handed over to our knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of them The named young officer raised his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinhatai is impatient: "Have a fart!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young aristocratic hippie smile Road: "Rhein Hatha, you can be both the eldest son of the family, and a fiancee who is called the most beautiful lady, waiting for you to go back, and then, without you presiding over the wedding for me, I don't think it is a taste."<br <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight of the Knights of the Prouds said: "The Morgan College has too many exam papers to be submitted, no headmaster cheated me, I am not willing to go sin." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young prince from the Orfgang family dug his nose and said: "Our tenth rule, no one is allowed to leave a comrade, I I haven't forgotten it, and I have been punished by you for hundreds of times. It is difficult to forget."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty blushes and says: "Really dead, A lot of death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty slowly rises up and says: "Give you a minute to convey this message and allow anyone to leave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This day is the sacred calendar September 12, 834, except for the place where the three messengers left the day after being named the glorious hills, no one left the team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirteenth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the command of the Rhein-Hatta Knights of the Empire’s highest Iron Oak Medal winner, the Knights of 600 people circled a beautiful arc and started the first contact. The sneak attack, killing sixty-three people, and only six people in the dead, buried the site and quickly evacuated the battlefield, looking for the next fighter. The Titans gathered their fronts with extreme shock and ignorance of the truth and launched the first wave of searches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights were selected by the Titan Northern elite border army to pick up the Knights of the Thousands, because they had prepared a precise retreat route and set up countless incredible on the route. The serial trap, the loss of the Titan’s casualties on the frontal battlefield and the pursuit of chasing reached an absurd agreement, totaling 300 people with a loss of combat power. The poet Fried is not sure of the exact number of ambushes in the sacred empire, and has not changed the main line of the sacred red whip headed by the "Gagoley statue", but has to invest 3,000 troops to deal with the endless side or even the rear. Attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred imperial knights with only a few hundred people remaining still maintain the strategy of concentrating their troops to eat small enemy forces, stalking twice on small scales Contact war, but under the pursuit of the Titan army, the first single day loss to 100 people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A surprisingly silent day. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fried began to doubt whether he fell into the enemy’s trap, slowed down the advancement of the “Gagogli sculpture” of the leading troops, and prepared to mobilize other than sculpture. All the more than 5,000 troops launched an intensive encirclement. Because he was really tired of the news that the knights were scratched with poisonous thorns and the large amount of water was poisoned, as well as the small patterns of trapping traps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shunfeng face several times at the same time set fire to the mountain, once again let Fried lost 300 people, the key is directly affecting the morale of the subordinates. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Fried, who had completely lost his patience, recalled 800 statues of Gogol and started a crazy round-up, but the sly Knights fled directly to the Titan Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the 20th. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fried finally surrounded the Knights with only 50 people on a small hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloody whole thigh was pulled out of a hole by a fat man sitting on the ground, holding a young man in his arms who was cut off by the Titan’s heavy arm. The man was pale and dying. He looked up and said: "Rhein Hatha, really hurts."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty bow, blood and tears have flowed Dry, bitterly said: "Little Bran, I am sorry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young man shook his head with difficulty and squeezed a naive smile. "Head, are we not? Really brave a time? Is this empire no longer laughs at us like a knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man nodded, "We are the most brave, No one can deny it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and the dying young knight are sitting back to back with fifty-three people, all of them are seriously injured, the armor is broken, the long sword is broken, Bloody, bandaged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people calmly close their eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man looked up and looked around. Brod, who likes a big butt blonde woman, died and was cut off because he was chased and even buried. . Pruger, who is not a straightforward character, is also dead. I don’t know whether it’s three or four Titan spears that have penetrated the body. The fat man didn’t see it clearly and died. The little bastard of the Orfgang family, who always changed the way to make wine, died, and they all died. They even died for their masters. The fifty-three are left, oh, Bran is also dead, that is fifty-two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man gently put down the body of Bran, and stood up, almost at the same time, everyone stood up, holding a blunt or broken knight Sword, the mountain is a dense Titan soldier, the fat man told them that many of the chop from the "God red whip." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man grinned hard. "The beautiful Columbs brought our family letters and badges, so the empire can know how we died." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone smiled and struggled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatty Rheinhamtai crossed his arms to the chest and performed the most solemn knighthood of his life to the last comrade, the last knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this day, no one surrendered, and no one retreated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Empire’s military squad is shocked to return to the Beluga Fortress. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chamber of Deputies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere is dignified. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top Nero master who took the title of a memo officer picked up a chair and smashed the face of Duke, who was embarrassed by the face, and screamed with red eyes. Why do you ignore Rhein-Hattai's suggestion, until the Knights' messengers sent the news to the Gogol Plains the next day, you brought this up, are you an idiot?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the official ranks are worse than a dozen levels, but the Earl of Dürer who escaped from the chair did not dare to anger at all, but only slightly whispered, seems to want to explain, but opened No mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Pompey squinted and his face was gloomy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Old Monte Cristo calmed his face and the old man who had been talking very well was really angry this time. It was the first time he got the news and sent a large army. Go to support the little knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Executive, Duke Robert, said: "Since there is still no news of the Titan Secrets approaching the Beluga Fortress and the Mill's Resident, it shows that this conspiracy has died, although Count Dürer has made mistakes, but it is not impossible to save. The war has just begun. We are still at a starting point with the Titans, not to mention that we still have certain advantages."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The handsome blonde Nero has to worry about the chair, and the father sitting in the main position has held his arm and shook his head slightly. The Marquis slowly said: "This is not a mistake that can be ignored or compensated by the next battle. I will explain everything to the emperor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Dürer trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two strange figures appeared at the door of the Chamber of Deputies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skinny is a young man in a common cavalry costume, with a shocking mottled blood, holding a parcel in his hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of his vicissitudes is obviously more eye-catching, a holy robe that can be counted in Vatican’s hands with almost one hand, the old man It is the spiritual leader of the Southern Great Parish, the Archbishop of Gruzin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Pompeii stunned and finally recognized the young man whose face was faintly visible, but at this time, the young man’s eyes were cold and depressed. The decisiveness and anger of the youth, the young people put the parcel gently on the long table, untied, the chiefs in the chamber can know that it is more than one hundred letters, more than one hundred family badges, a doll The youth of the face is hard-lined: "If it is not forced by the head of Rhein Hatai, there will be a 13-petal royal badge, Duke Diller, I will tell your father about your crimes and see you being watched. Hanged!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Dürer, who has lived a good life on the southern border all year round, has a stunned look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Pompey sighs in his heart, respectfully rises and bends: "Prince of Columbine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone is completely at a loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baby face knight waiter does not have any mood swings, just look down on the table and write those words on the table, even a lot of letters are looking for people to write, and pick from the chest More than a hundred of the family badges with black blood stains, tears streaming, gently said: "All the war is dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day The Holy Empire and the Titan Empire all fought. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The war is in the smoke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Empire found a complete and incomplete body of more than 400 imperial soldiers, loaded with coffins, leaving more than one hundred empty and only one The coffin of the family crest is escorted to the Imperial Capital by the Royal Knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All pass through Caesars Gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a hundred aristocratic families from various empire counties gathered in Caesar's Grand Place in Jupiter City. Their only common denominator was the death of the heir, who entrusted the child to a fat knight named Rheinhatten, many of which were large. The nobility also smiled and said to the fat man, "Give the child to you, I am relieved." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all of the emperors are automatically gathered in the square, more spectacular than the time to send the Kakar to the Mayan Snow Mountain Temple, but that time is a thunderous move, this Once it was all sobbing and sobbing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first time in the history of the Imperial War to be the heirs of so many aristocrats in a battle, and they are all so young. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jude Jupiter, who rarely appeared in public view, wore a set of white knights, standing on the side of Caesars Gate, and the other side was the first public display. Prince of Goron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a knight in the coffin, Rhein-Hattai, a fat man who seems funny when he wins many victories, until this day, the empire knows that he is really Who, the students at Morgan College know who the authors of the classic textbooks are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire empire is madly spreading the 13 rules of the Knights, especially the last one: we have never been alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fat man wrote two letters, one sent to his fiancee, a lady of the local family with the same name as the Princess of the Titan Empire, said to be fat Like the knight, there are freckles on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dying book begins with "My dear Princess Barbara: I regret that this is the last love letter I wrote to you." Bara, you are in my heart, always the most beautiful lady, this sentence is the most sincere love words I can think of, I love you" end. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another letter with a small number of words was sent to the descendants of the traitor who were abhorred by the empire, Augustine, but it was never made public. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Handsome and clever Augustine Master: I am disappointed, I have not been able to walk down the battlefield, no wonder you always say that I am a fool, but I know, teach me The Knights Code respects you, respects the world, respects our country, respects the family we live in. I always aim at you. I hope that one day I can make you proud of me, so this time, I choose When the empire needs me, there is no retreat. When I just add glory to the glory of the empire, I will go home with a treacherous and treacherously with a medal, as a gift to my wife and leave it to my children. But when the empire needs me to pay, no matter me. How timid, cowardly, selfish, I have to give everything, including life. Veterans are not dead, aster flowers will never die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
