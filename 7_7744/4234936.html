Today 3 chapters!)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quentin The lady slammed her eyes wide, biting her lip, and her eyes were desperate and empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a rapidly wilted rose flower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has gone through all the hardships to escape from the Pope’s “big rattlesnake” in the arrangement of teachers and family, deducting the dispersion of the three major punishment institutions in the early Pope’s Hall. Hunting and harassment of several underground forces of the Holy Empire, she finally managed to live quietly in Maso County for nearly five years. The ambitions of the young age were shattered, and the desire for revenge was deeply buried in the heart because of the disparity in strength. Finally, I was able to grasp the bargaining chip that had an equal dialogue with the Greenspan family. I suddenly got involved in the eyes of the people, such as the baby’s fragile order, and its owner even used her force to throw her into the poem, and she could not help but pierce her. The last layer of the woman's thin defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, her numb eyes gradually turned into panic and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a guy is still working tirelessly to open her virgin land for 30 years, the action is still rough and violent, the only difference is nothing more than a battlefield, from Wall to small bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour, Mrs. Quentin felt funny and angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the old-fashioned aristocrat-born bastard didn’t repeat the half-hour sweet talk, of course, he certainly wouldn’t stop exploring her body, every inch. Every detail is full of his male atmosphere, like a male lion peeing around the territory, so that the exhausted Mrs. Quentin feels discomfort and angry, but her flushed and moist body seems to have a tendency to betray her soul. , even shamelessly catered to his slick provocative and gentle violations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two hours, Mrs. Quentin, who was "full", was squeezed out of her last strength, like a bonito fish to let the guy play, and she The body has long since ignored the command and obeyed the desire to move up and down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "great" man who has been tireless for two hours in bed without any drug support, like Mrs. Quentin, is sweating all over, looks a bit Greasy, the two bodies fit perfectly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you let me go?" Mrs. Quentin gasped, her pleadings more like a seductive encounter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The obedient kitten has candy to eat." Augustine narrowed his eyes and squeezed her proud double peak with her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will be very obedient." Quentin-Florence hesitated for a long time, but the man who seems to be on her seems to be endless and full of skillful impact. Close your eyes, blushing and gnashing your teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to attack again, I don't want to be the food of the Irish death together?" Augustine asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No." Mrs. Quentin shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swear to the Queen of Gama." Augustine cautiously said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The servant Quentin-Florence vowed to the honorable Queen of Gama that she would no longer attempt to harm Augustine Rothschild." Mrs. Quentin opened her eyes. The eyes are a bit weird. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin finally turned over, evacuated from her, lying next to her, looking at the ceiling, gasping for breath, this is definitely the most test of whether men are truly heroic Physical strength. He did not vent his inner negative emotions and solved the burning of more than a year, and he fell asleep irresponsibly. He reached out and put his hands on his body, and gently Stroking the chest full of scratches and hickeys, the fingers are entwined on one of her buds, the other hand evokes her sharp and unusual chin, and smiles: "I know you must hate me to the extreme, But I also know that your body has objections to this, don't rush to deny it, the facts are facts, your mouth is no longer dexterous, and you can't change it. Let's go back to the negotiating table, this is a small memory filled with good memories. Bed, I believe that we can abandon a lot of unnecessary prejudice and suspicion. I, the founder of cosmo, the unofficial consul who is not recognized by you, you, a sexy stunner that is unknown to me, my future The little Persian cat does not have the factors that make us both have to use force."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Respected and sophistical Augustine, you seem to have forgotten what you just Use whole Two hours are busy insulting me, and now your two hands are still playing around with me. Do you think that changing to any woman will recognize your so-called 'no factor in putting the two into force'?" Mrs. Quentin sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have tarnished you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine laughed. "Mr. Quentin also tarnished me."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin couldn’t help but burst into the arms of Augustine in a hurry, biting a bite on his shoulder, and again with a bloody taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine did not stop, let her deepen her strength and plunge her teeth into his skin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin stopped her movements, stiffened her body, and for a long time she gave a repressed whine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin gently hugged her and whispered: "My little Persian cat, surrender to bad luck and desire, and fall will bring you the most joyful joy." Like a madman, stupid things with destiny and empire, don't do it, make a carefree big vase, and rest in the study room called Augustine. I tell you, you are me. The key to the Greenspan family and the County of Maso County, you are generally aware of the situation of cosmo, the offense is the best defense, I need more Caesar gold coins, more territory and cards, Judith will not be patient After I became acquainted with the Marceau County by myself, I slowly squirmed all kinds of blood-sucking insects and parasites. The golden trident of the sacrament was an elephant, and the emperor was tired of its arrogance and slowness. So, a beautiful little bunny pet, give me a list, and put the qualifications into the bishops, lords, slave owners, bankers, knights, mages, and so ons of the Ministry of the Holy See, all listed, I want Throw them all in just In the interrogation room that was set up, there was no big Caesar gold coin to redeem. This group of fat pigs would not want to see the bright sunshine of the next day."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Crazy?" Mrs. Quentin whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the moment I decided to let you extend my right hand, I was crazy, but my mind would be clearer and know how to be a smart madman. Augustine smiled confidently. Maybe his smile is the only sunshine of cosmo. It is so today, and even more. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't give you." Mrs. Quentin shook her head and retracted her body, trying to keep her distance from Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, I like to anticipate the worst of it before something happens." Augustine squints and no longer touches Quentin-Florence The graceful and exquisite body seems to be tired of being tired, looking up at the ceiling. "Take you a poem, it is nothing more than letting yourself make up your mind to Marceau County. It is important that you open or not, but it is planned for me. Not fatal. You don't talk, I have my students, lovely Miss Alice. I believe she will be happy to tell me about all the insider and secrets of Maso County."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Quentin seems to hear the most humorous joke, her hands protect her chest, curled up, and squinted at the young man's angular side face, cold voice: "Don't you know who made the attack black swan?" Lake's plan?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Alice?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin was surprised, but calmed down The speed is far beyond Mrs. Quentin’s expectation. He is pleased to smile: “I know that the guys who are proficient in Pajage are half military geniuses.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If it wasn't for the team that was responsible for attacking the poetry brothers' castle, he wouldn't listen to Alice's embarrassment, and he would be arrogant and determined to place the battle site at the door of the poetry brother's castle, and would not let you play the spirit of Scarlett." The chance of elegy, then the defeat may not be changed, but at least it will not be wiped out by the whole army, and it will not let the reserve forces hidden behind it lose the courage to move forward. However, in the open-air balcony of the White Elephant Castle, you are ready to see your ruined nobles and rich people. Expression changes are wonderful, than Saskatchewan Drama also dramatic. "Mrs. Quentin indifferent smiles, full of sarcasm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Kitty, you were a bystander at that time, how boring, you are now a player, isn’t it also a blessing in disguise?” Augustine Cheeky Smiling, sideways, head resting on the arm, staring at her still high - the seductive face of the blushing after the tide, extending down, is the slender little waist, and the peach-shaped hip curve, he pondered The place where the female knight squats from Hera's only victory over this little Persian cat may be her signature long legs. They are all one-of-a-kind vases, swallowing water honey-Peach once Augustine is exceptionally satisfied, body and mind are happy, stretch out your fingers, curl a glimpse of Quentin-Florence's supple hair, softly say: "No matter what, wait for you After getting out of bed, this county, the empire, the continent, the world, no one can bully you before crossing my body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Augustine, I am not a 16-year-old ignorant girl, not a vase lady who is willing to run away with a shabby knight after listening to a few court poems." Mrs. Quentin overslept, no longer looking at the serious and fascinating face. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Believe it or not."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin continues to play with her hair, gentlely:" Just like I said to retaliate against the Holy See and the Empire Grand Aristocrats, no one would believe that if I told you at the White Elephant Castle, I have already let St. Urbane fall to this plane. Do you believe it? So, lovely The gorse kitten is honestly curled up in my arms, I will protect you, but you also need to give your meekness and surrender."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
