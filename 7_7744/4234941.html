			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Today's red ticket wins 1000, I also strive to write the second chapter in the early morning.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Being decapitated against the neck, Louis's slightly pale, cold, handsome face immediately picked up, no fear, only anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he is not the untouchable Louis who has no surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Holy Empire, aristocratic badges can bring shelter, Caesar gold coins can also bring shelter, and Louis, who was born in the slum slave market in Lolita slave market, was After Master Heber selected and successfully won the honor of the chief steward of Ascott Manor, he was wearing the red heart lion badge and had countless gold coins, so he always believed that he was a nobleman of the nobility, and there would be no more despicable slave owners. Playing whip on him, there will not be a unique old nobleman who dares to covet his beauty. In Mississippi, there are still people who dare to assassinate him as a big man who is favored by Master Heber? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 55th element of the water, the Naga, was smashed by two great knights and splashed into the ground. This was originally a beautiful magical pet with a revealing red color. "Because the elements gathered to follow the principle of proximity, the blood of the scarlet on the Colosseum became the best nutrient after being created by Augustine, and it took a lot of nobles on the table during its rush to Louis. The red wine liquid, so it is indeed a magical handicraft that can be called a work of art. Of course, its destructive power can not be underestimated. Otherwise, it will never go forward with the professional literacy of the two lions who have been through the battlefield. Resist, but one should guard Louis, and the other attack, so poor Louis was seized by a high-end female assassin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thought that the Mississippi audience, who was on the verge of a war, opened their mouths slightly and looked at each other. They found that the other side was inconspicuous, and they used to have a comfortable life. The rich man looked at the young knight who claimed to be from the Ministry of the Sacred, and smashed the assassin who captured the male master of the Ascott Manor. She was the woman who appeared in the public eye after the broken glass window. The devil is wearing a strange gothic mask of the Mother Earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The haze of Louis is perfect at this moment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost at the same time as Mrs. Quentin, she quietly reached out and gave secret instructions to the 9th-level knight and the four mages in the cage, indicating their speed. Take the damn young sacrament of the ministry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four 9-level mature knights unanimously mention the knight's sword, no longer thinking about whether the enemy really comes from the sacrament that is darker than the abyss. Under the influence of family loyalty, it is courageous to prepare for this breath. Strange man. But at the moment when they swept the sword to Augustine, their heads, the ceiling of the Mississippi Arena was blasted through three large holes with a diameter of about two meters, and three black-filled "Knights" full of death. The four Todd 猛 plucked from the knight and then stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While wearing a knight armor, holding a hybrid giant sword, the standard melee knight assembly, but not a knight, because the unqualified knight will be far from evil. The undead also needs to draw faith from the eight major sources, but the three chivalry appearances of the knights are filled with dirty "nether embraces". They have no eyes, empty holes, and black arrogance with their mouths. The flesh and blood, just the skeleton, they are still tall and burly, let people know for the first time that they were also the orthodox knights of the stalwart, but now they are more powerful, it is almost the terror of the 17th-level dragon knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bone Knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perfect crystallization of black magic and sorcerer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three skeleton knights are the great knights who were used as experimental products by the Yangjiao Lab after the death of the Poetry Castle. The Earl of Dillon was from the Cavaliers, one was the private bodyguard of the southern big banker Lifao, and the other was the Knights of the 3rd Head of the Saints, the bishop of Poland, all of whom were genuine knights, the undead transformation of the horns. After they died, they were promoted to two small steps. One of the skeleton knights, codenamed "Little Lily", already had the level of the dragon knight. At this moment, Sayuri, who has a cute nickname, has already grabbed a 9 with an overwhelming advantage. The neck of the lion king knight is easily twisted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine did not stop its atrocities, this death is too gentle compared to the arena. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened the "Sardinian Doctrine" that was under his arm and was ready to begin reading the first round of sanctions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone is preparing to slip out of the Mississippi Underground Arena, fearing that it will be hit by the disaster that is destined to be private. The guy was frightened and found a beautiful little loli in the channel, a gorgeous and cuddly gorse chiffon gown, short and charming, with a smile, but behind her two undead creatures shrouded in a wide red robe cloak. Not cute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind her, blood from the ground, like a stream, spread to her feet under the fine black sheepskin boots. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said, I am a big man in the ministry. They are not willing to believe if they are alive, I have to let them die." Little Loli eyes Nothing, the voice is not big, but it just happened to let the entire Mississippi Arena hear, because the hall is too quiet, almost people can hear their heartbeat, one or two timid have not seen the big world nouveau riche The businessman has already fainted, lying on the ground very well, spitting foam and limbs twitching. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is the arena recognized by Archbishop Lahm, I personally reserve the opinion on the legality of the existence of Mississippi."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled and attracted all sights at once. "I personally retain my opinion on the gladiators who lost the official titles of the Cavaliers and Sorcerers and the aliens that have been captured from the Muse." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone feels inexplicable, Louis is so, even Mrs. Quentin can't understand what he wants to say for a time, only with two red robes." Ms. Elizabeth, who had been killed all the way to Mississippi, knew that the two toys were very satisfied with the two toys. They were more perverted than the skeleton knights. They were new with her creations combined with Irish undead books. Species, in the long period of Dark Magic, there is no shortage of Muse Shaman trying to degenerate the human wizard's undead, but the finished product is not satisfied. Her original intention is only to help Augustine to build a deadly version with the skeleton knight. Christie + Master, "a classic combination, but do not know she quietly establish a milestone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, there is a real knight who died in a deliberate arrangement in Mississippi. This is the Todd family's love for the entire knight class. Insults. The Ministry of the Ministry will impose sanctions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin whispered, referring to the broken body of one of the loser knights, who was torn by the Tauren Chieftain Two halves, this is also a small reason why he wants to shelter the half-orc warrior but does not do it. After all, the situation of a strange race from a half-orc is far more vivid than the human history book. Elizabeth has always been a half-orc. Sneering at it, I don’t even bother to understand the deep structure of this race, so I have been unable to satisfy Augustine’s curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Impossible!" Can no longer keep the calm Lewis nervous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will keep the body of this knight, and even give it to your Todd family, let you check it yourself." Augustine sneered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The face of Louis who is still close to the neck is bloodless, because the struggle has been excessive, the neck has been smeared with a blood mark, but the inner panic has beaten the sting of the skin. He is not stupid enough to quickly think about the authenticity of Augustine's remarks, and the results have made him more and more desperate. This must be a conspiracy of some people in the sacrament against him or the Ascott Manor, because the fortress is a Knight gladiator. It is not impossible for identity screening to verify that Mississippi is not strict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is an unforgivable god to make and bear witness to the killing on the Sabbath." Augustine sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only Louis, so the masculine ladies who were excited by the bloody corner of Mississippi were all drastically changed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bigger the arena, even if there are big people participating in the dividends behind the scenes or giving fuzzy support to the attitude, the less the competition will be held on a religious festival like the Sabbath. Activities, in fact, after Mississippi got the nod of the Holy See Red Archbishop and a deputy chief executive of the county, the two dignitaries will not forget that it seems that it is not painful, and that He Hepa tries to follow the rules as much as possible. The young master has never been taken seriously, but the chief steward who came from a humble beginning to adopt a cautious habit is still doing it, but after getting the exact news that the Ministry of the Sanctuary has withdrawn from Maso County, the Ashes Manor must take out a lot of gold coins to transport the mysterious channel. So, this is mad, how can Louis expect to suddenly emerge a madman who claims to be a sacrament, and with a batch of arrogant arrogance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who wants to raise a sword for me?" Augustine smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you see everyone, is the members of the sacrament so noble? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only three high-ranking knights on the arena humiliated and put down the sword, and the four mages also gave up the attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Repent, write down your sins, and I will collect your confession after talking to the Count of Heber." Augustine looked to the beautiful young Louis, " The housekeeper, before taking me to see the Count of Heber, first sent everyone a pen and paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis squinted, gnashed his teeth, but failed to reject this guy. proposal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
