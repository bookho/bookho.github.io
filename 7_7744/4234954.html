			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day, only Augustine and Rhein-Hattai were left, and everyone else called the carriage to leave the Dolly Manor, which shows the Duchess’ Thunder’s means. Without dragging her water, since her Augustine is to become a veritable knight, she will not let anyone in Bossain delay her son's practice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duchess sitting in the carriage looked back at the increasingly small Bossashan Castle and sighed heavily, if her Augustine was just a common aristocrat She doesn't have the sentimentality at this time. The ordinary delicate child wants to be the knight trained by Gugligli? It’s absolutely impossible. In a few days, I will cry and go home, but her Augustine is different. This child can endure the “torture” of the black robe woman for nearly three years. The talent is not good, and it is absolutely beyond the mental perseverance. Ordinary, this also means that her son is very likely to embark on a rugged and long road with a long distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaca, sitting next to the Duchess, asked softly: "Madam, are you worried about Master Augustine? Actually, I really want to know why he wants to be a knight." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duchess looked at Gaka, softly said: "Child, I tell you, men are born to let women look up to them instead of looking up at the stars." This instinct may be ruined by the arduous life of a poor life, or it may be buried by the aristocratic education of a poor aristocratic education, but my Augustine, from an early age, knows how to strengthen his goal. Maybe he does not have your memory. But this does not mean that he is no more intelligent than you. Children, smart children often do not mean wisdom, but intelligent people must be smart, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaca Shaking his head, he said: "Mrs, I don't understand what you mean."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duchess laughed: "When you understand, you can almost return. Your father is your elegant lady."<br /><br />&nbs p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The castle of Bossan is still in the messy blacksmith shop, our "prestige and powerful" white knight Gugligli is wearing a animal skin top with coarse linen pants and the broken toes. In front of the boots, he stood in front of Li Fu Tuo and the two eyes of Rhein Hatai. In the eyes of the latter's fat man, the white knight at the moment is somewhat incomprehensible to the title of the imperial knight, but look at the jing grid. The beard, not lush but beautiful chest hair, the toe drilled from the leather boots, is completely the style of the master. In short, in the eyes of Rhein Hatai, Gugligli put a fart, he can not wait to take the bag Put it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You want to be a knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guligli looked at the corner of his mouth and still had a little fat man who stole rabbit meat and stained oil. It seems a little dare I believe that Guligly in the day has always maintained the face of a serf, who can imagine that this guy who seems harmless to the human and animal alone has singled out the entire horrible black robe assassin team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the Cavaliers are my dream!" The little fat man with red face trembled because of nervousness and excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know the meaning of the knight?" Gugligli asked with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein Hatter wiped a mouth and stiffened like a javelin As straight as you can, Lang said: "The knight is the guardian of justice and honor of the sacred empire! He will destroy the evil Titan empire and the black magician and the pagans, protect the kind but ignorant businessmen and serfs, according to the wishes of the king and the Holy See. Tolerance and strength bring to any piece of land in the empire! I will treat the weak with kindness, I will treat the enemy with sternness, I will treat the nobles with gentlemen..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Damn, again A brainwashed idiot, I have a headache every time I hear such a mess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guligli whispered, scratching his head, getting up I found a hammer and threw it at the stunned fat man. I was lazy and said: "If this is the purpose of the knight in your mind, then you should follow me to iron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the heavy hammer, if struck by lightning, the pillar of faith in the heart is folded by the biggest idol in mind. He is not stupid sinking big head went blank, "Knight Quotations" and countless epic poem singing is not all it describes the purpose of the Knights do? Integrity, nobleness, kindness, isn’t it necessary to ride a gun for these words? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Augustine, standing next to the fat man, quietly put a beautiful letterhead printed with a family badge on his back, and the eye-shaped Rhein Hatai saw it. After the statement, he said: "The knight’s duty is to pick up the guns and swords in the hands of the emperor and the Holy See, to become the butchers in armor, and to treat all the guys who violate the Holy Empire and the Vatican’s will. Heresy, cut the heads of these guys is to defend the greatest justice. In addition, the Cavaliers can completely discuss some academic issues with the lonely ladies, and have dinner with the girls who worship the heroes." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guligli stunned. He wanted to take this stupid fat man out of the blacksmith shop. He smiled and smiled: "Yes, there is potential, at least I will not participate in an inexplicable war for no reason, then a fog." The water died in the so-called knighthood. Fat man, since you came to Dodo as a knight, you will take away your innocence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Augustine sneaked this note into the cuff and ignored the gratitude of Rheinham. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he came to this world, the elegant and intelligent mother taught him that he would give a favor to others, especially a nobleman, not only can not expect to return, but must In dealing with the damage that comes at any time, he didn't understand it at first. In the past two years, he had heard more about the old court's anecdote, and he believed that this sentence is definitely a famous saying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guligli blew a whistle, and the white horse, which was covered in snow, quickly ran out of the nearby woods, Gugligli The two children just thrown on the horse, he led the way into the depths of the woods, but fortunately Augustine and Rheinhatai have horseback riding experience. The three people continued to penetrate the Yagb Forest under the gradual thickening of the trees. The fat man looked around curiously. He heard that the forest was hunted by the elves. He was full of thoughts and thoughts about whether he could meet naked females. The elves, not only the sacred empire, but in fact there are very few orcs on the entire epic continent, so those who risk their lives to cross the ruins of the empire of the ruins of the northernmost land, stalking the mighty squad of the border army to the wild continent The bounty hunters or mercenaries who hunt all kinds of orcs can make huge profits, provided that they can come back from the wild land of the crisis. In fact, very few people can return to the epic continent without missing their arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But 500 percent of the horror profits are enough for the people who are going to succeed to throw their heads, and an elf captured from the wild land can auction at least two in the Holy Empire. Ten thousand Caesar gold coins, if it is only a young female, it is no doubt that the old aristocrats who have strange singularity can double the gold coins. And a Tauren chief who can make a sensation in the arena can easily auction up to 5,000 Caesar gold coins. To know that a serf spends a maximum of a dozen gold coins a year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guligli, who led the way, walked on the path covered with fallen leaves, faintly said: "Don't be awkward, this forest has only fierce like three saber-toothed tigers. Carnivores and some low-end herbivores in the food chain. If you want to find the so-called elves, I advise you to go to the Kuhn auction site in Oggs Song City, of course, if your sexual orientation is extensive to these animals. I am interested, just when I didn't say it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Absolutely no!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man quickly stated that he did not want his big idol to regard himself as a sinister beast. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a dark road, the horseshoes smashed a rotten smell, faintly hearing the screaming birds and the low shackles that were confined in the unknown darkness. The fat man who was covered in goosebumps slammed the sleeves of Li Futu, for fear that he would take out a long-lived beast and let him swallow him. Finally, as the sound of clearer and clearer waters came to an end, the scenery made them stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A majestic waterfall like a huge white satin hanging in the air rushes down like a horse that has lost its reins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humanity must be insignificant at the moment, human beings can easily ignore or forget their own smallness, only the gods and magnificent emperors overlooking the altar This will be remembered when the scepter or the great power of nature is witnessed, and then we admit that we are humble in our hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One horse, three people standing on a huge rock protruding outward, just in the middle of the waterfall, at the foot is the splash of the splashing water The deep pool is like a bloody mouth that swallows people at any time. After the dismissal, the fat man subconsciously stepped back a few steps, and he did not want to die in such an inaccessible place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guligli whispered: "I ask you, what are the conditions for a powerful knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man can't wait for a brain: "Strong body, excellent perseverance, firm belief. The first is the foundation, the second is the key, the last one, I keep the point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that talking about the Cavaliers’ "belief" problem is very unpleasant, the fat man is not stupid enough to entangle, and the dialogue in the blacksmith shop is a scene that makes the fat man feel depressed all his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kuligli, who knew that he had asked a very boring question, shrugged and looked at the fat man and asked: "Then I will ask you a different way, a powerful How can the Cavaliers gain strength in strength? Is it training day by day according to the Knights' Charter? Is it to enter the army to increase experience through actual combat? Or to rack up your brains to practice some weird skills?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fat man is sluggish, of course he does not know the answer, so he came here to be a knight boy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin just waited for the answer very quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guligli’s face hidden behind the beard reveals a look that makes the two children feel bad, and has a rich conspiracy. The middle-aged man standing on the peak of the empire's countless knights sneered: "I will tell you the answer, it is to challenge the self-limit once and for all. What is the limit? Fat man, you can eat up to ten chicken legs at a time. At the risk of dying, you have eaten fifteen pieces. Does this make sense for you to become a knight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinhatai has a misty face: "Of course No."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guligli gives a fat soul Once again, the unsuccessful answer, the uncle smiled and asked Augustine, "Can you tell me what you think?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin closed his eyes and took a deep breath, Then went to the outermost end of the cliff, and finally jumped into the abyss of the general gate of hell in the collapse of the fat man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suicide? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a vocabulary in his mind. He really can't figure out why this noble and treacherous Augsburger demon can't think of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the confused fat man asking the answer, Gugligli kicked his ass in one foot, and then a fat man with a trick that almost stunned the impact of the waterfall Draw a ugly arc in the air and fall into the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guligly lingered on the edge of the cliff, feeling the chin with a strong beard, and squinted: "The warrior surpasses the limits of physical fitness, magic Does the teacher surpass the limit of nuclear power, is it comparable to the limit of death? The world’s knights are like ants, and they may climb to the top. Why? It’s nothing more than most people can’t try. Go to 'suicide', children, I believe that you belong to that kind of lucky guy. After all, not everyone can survive this kind of adventure game, otherwise I am not the 'Emperor Six Knights' but the Empire The Sixth Cavaliers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guligli, who was kneeling on the edge of the cliff, waited for a long time, and finally two heads emerged from the shallower water surface of the waterfall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is silent Augustine, one is crying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guligli stared at Li Fu Tuo and said to himself: "It’s their son, they have a good brain and they have enough energy, such a man. The child is simply a born noble, and the Cavaliers should be regarded as an extra profession. It should also be able to live up to expectations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suddenly jumped, his figure fell rapidly, one end The unkempt hair flutters wildly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was about to fall into the deep pool, a toe was lightly pressed, and his foot seemed to form a huge black hole in an instant, and a splash of water drove around him. In the eyes of Augustine and the fat man, this man is undoubtedly as strong as a demon at the moment. The deep pool is like a torn hole in his hard life, and a gorgeous water-stained barrier is shocked in the circle centered on him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guliggli’s bounces on a stone on the edge of a deep pool, looking at two children who can’t speak in the distance , smiled and said: "My strength, maybe it is the return of your life in the future. If you want to be a powerful knight, don't rush to complain when you don't get a point. The world complains too much. The mediocre people who have not paid off, I tell you, one day, you will get 11 points of rich harvest when you pay very much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fat man wiped out the mixture of snot and tears, and smiled sillyly: "Is it enough to jump like this every day?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This big idiot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The icy Augustine couldn’t help but roll his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guligli took a hard-boiled beef jerky and smiled with a very obvious gloating sorrow: "Let yourself fearlessly die, dare to once Going to challenge all kinds of seemingly unsurpassable limits, this is just an introduction. You have to do what a knight will do, and you need to do it twice. They don’t need to do it. You also need to do it. Double it. Do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the words and endings, frowning Gugligli said: "Why, want to give up?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
