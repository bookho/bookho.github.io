			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Holy Empire, the most vicious curse of a nobleman is not "Go to hell when you die," but "You are going to be with Vatican The guys in the Ministry of the Holy See have talked about teachings." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a sacred ministry that floats over the empire's territory like a ghost and a god of death. On the mainland, the "father of the spirit" worships the Austrian Holy See as the Pope's Judgment Hall, 400 The Vatican Tingang, which was split from Byzantine and finally rooted in the sacred empire, was called a heresy ruling, even if it was the auspicious city of Augsburg, who dared to publicly insult the priest’s head. Prince Des, I am afraid I dare not blame the three dark giants in the heretical ruling. Even if he is the biggest public enemy of the Titan Empire, the son of the god of war, it is only privately blaming the Holy Spirit Hall in the three carriages of the heresy ruling. The Ministry of the Holy Sepulchre in the Holy Empire is affiliated with the Vatican in the institution, but the power is far above the other two of the Holy See. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vatican’s Holy See is marked by a gold tripod, and the three giants of the heresy ruling form a dark triangle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holy Spear". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Empire Night Watcher priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother of the "Ewe" organization, the mysterious woman nicknamed the Black Goat Queen. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, it seems that the only ministry in Vatican’s institutions that rivals the Holy See will be the fourth “black priest”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial City of Zhudu, the outside of the conference room of the St. John's Cathedral in the Vatican City of Vatican, has gathered a large number of prominent figures that are not easily seen. There is a support for the head of the emperor's parish, Benjamin Burton, although the 45-year-old archbishop has not yet been promoted to the red archbishop who is only one step away from the priest's scepter, but as a younger brother who has won the trust of both the emperor and the new shepherd. And the conservative bishops, including all the nobles including the Imperial Capital, believe that the pivotal bishop can go further on the ladder of power, and even the old Red Archbishop Anita does not praise him in this young piety. The person saw the shadow of the Holy See’s newest Saint Ieta, and in fact it is said that Bishop Burton has been studying the saint’s "teaching" recently, which is not young but always humbly before the world. At the moment, the Archbishop is surrounded by a large number of high-level members of the Holy See, such as the Middle Ages, such as the Evangelical Archbishop, who hopes to discover the "gospel" from the pivotal bishop.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n Bsp;With the fourth seat of the Academic Affairs Office, Secretary of State Palme, another circle is formed. They are the most passionate reformers in the Imperial Court, and they are incompatible with Benjamin Burton. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two smaller circles beside the two big circles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old man, they are all elderly people who have entered the graveyard with one foot, have lost their desire to pursue the throne of power, mostly buried in the vast expanse of the Holy See, occasionally Looking up, I finally turned my attention away from such great monographs as "City of Faith" and "Teaching", and only looked at the rise and fall of younger generations with squinting eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silent, they are the middle and high-level leaders of the Ministry of the Holy See, keeping a clear distance from everyone, even if it is one of the three internal organizations of the Ministry of the Ministry The "night vigil" ridiculed the members of the ruling hall of the robe of the robe. At this time, the bishops who deliberately had a private relationship with the locals were not far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is said that this lucky boy is called Augustine? What is the relationship with the Rotongschild family who is stupid enough to commit treason directly to the gallows? There is a godson in Saint Iyeta. It seems to be Augustine. But the godson seems to have never been in this rebellion. Three years ago, the adult of Iyeta died after Augusto’s death. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s this guy who was lucky and abandoned by the lucky goddess and then was thrown out of the olive branch. Maybe one day he will be beaten again. Turning to the ground, a guy who can't even be educated by the saints can only pray to the devil for the illusion of glory without a firm belief. I am afraid this is the real reason for Rotunchaid."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did he get into the Ministry of the Sacred, how can the Emperor’s Majesty personally become the head of the new agency 'cosmo' of the Ministry of the Ministry?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Lord Robertson, you must be too focused Doctrine study. Augustin Do not heard the young master is to expose whistleblowers Luo Tong treason Rothschild family do? "Someone sensitive ears bishop low voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He personally brought the elegant Duke of the imperial poet to the gallows?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp A burst of gloom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, this is really a 'loyalty' imperial citizen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These big people are always one or two steps away from the apex in their respective organs. The role of up to two or three steps, the real power in the empire does not need to wait for others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wait is always boring, so they are happy to tell each other interesting little topics that are irrelevant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" **The Secretariat’s information shows that after three years ago, after leaving the monastery, the young man who has now been deprived of the title secretly entered the night watchman’s organization. In the past two years, he has been promoted four times. Six months ago, he personally buried the 12-generation Luo Tong Chaid in the abyss of history. Some people said that he witnessed the treason of the traitor on the gallows. This Augustine is really a terrible Crazy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do such people have friends?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is said that in the Odeon Rachel met the young Nero of the Pompeii family and the disciple of the current Dean of the Aura Monastery, and later broke. It is said that Count Augustine is a lonely 'big man'." The tone is full of ridicule. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The young man who could have competed with Napoleon of the Emperor Red Man sage, but now he is destined to live in the shadow of the Ministry of the Holy Life for a lifetime, really sad. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real power finally came on stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone closes their mouths with interest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Archbishop of the Red Cross, who is in charge of the Central Diocese, came slowly. He did not push the two heavy meeting rooms and did not seem to be the first to enter. room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parme’s top boss, Second Secretary of State, Sa Di, also arrived at the outdoor aisle of the meeting. The 7th cardinal minister of the Holy See’s real power figure is burly and sharp-eyed. Such as the eagle owl, even the conceited Palme also converges a little bit arrogant, quietly step back and let the center position let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second secretary of state also did not open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true that there are more important church members of the Pizza Di to attend the meeting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't this a symbolic meeting that is far greater than the real meaning? Who will really dare to be the newcomer to the three organizations of the Holy Spirit Hall, the "Nightman" and the "Ewe", and the agency personnel are probably less than 10 "cosmo" leaders, the damn betrayal The laughing slogan of the empire, "Master Augustine", is it back? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which bishop said that the lovely Augustine entered our ministry is a sad thing?" A woman tall enough to praise the cardinal minister, Sa Di suddenly appeared In front of everyone, the smile is bright, if not behind a man who should be included in the ranks of the legendary empire, presumably the bishops are happy to shift the line of sight to the full fruit of her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t know who is the rich woman who seems to let Sadie adults show their taboos, and I don’t think this looks like a big talk and likes to swing around. The woman is a dangerous person, but the bishops know that the knight who wears gold behind her is the No. 2 Royal Knight next to Zhu Dian's Emperor, second only to the glory of the six great knights of the Empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hai Ji adults, please don't mind the unintentional language of the Archbishop. He did not offend the original intention of the Ministry of the Ministry of Justice." Sa Di sighed, some Unwilling to bow down to a woman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small whistle? I haven’t seen each other for more than a decade, and you have grown up." The first impression is that the tall woman who can’t talk about the city and wisdom Surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Sa Di? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vatican in the Vatican’s Holy See, known as the Cardinal Safir. Rachel? The only "Rager Tiger" who is willing to bow to the three emperors and the head of the country and the three chiefs of the Secretary of State? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishops are jaw-dropping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hai Ji adults? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sorcerer who has been mourning for the future of Master Augustine has lived in the Imperial City for more than 30 years and is qualified to learn some of the "Hai Ji Daren"*, so he The legs were soft and sweaty, and it felt like Satan had caught his neck and took him to hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Vatican, in addition to the Patriarch, the second to fourth places in the top ten of the Holy See’s power for half a century have never changed, they are The sacred spear of the empire, standing on the top of the gods, the holy pilgrimage shield, the old man who converted from the second heir to the Pope of the Byzantine Pope to the dark giant of the Vatican, lived for nearly 150 years. In front of him, money, power, and power seem to be short, like dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third place is the Duke of Teutonic, the leader of the night watchman organization, the peak of magic and arcane, who will appear from time to time in the Big Three. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth is that this first time I thought it was a special woman of the unique aristocratic bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flute of Sa Di is not the title and aura of the "mother of the ewe" on her head, but rather she will be the black alchemist of the Red Archbishop of the Holy See. The sculpt is made into a "small joke". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vatican’s Holy See has fought with the proud and arrogant Byzantine Arch of the Holy See for a full 700 years, only a short time in the last 50 years. Back to the great disadvantages, the nature of relying on and relying on is not the mouth of the scholastic or the scholastic theologians, but the bloody underground wars. It is the life of many great aristocrats who have lived for a lifetime without a chance. The thrilling arrival, so the second Secretary of State Sa Di is not only afraid of the actual age, I am afraid that at least 90 years old, Hai Ji adults, but also from the heart of the tribute. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't you get lost?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black Goat Queen" reveals a sexy and charming The smile, the finger on the shackles of the lips, squinting at the head, looked confused. "It is the most lovely butcher of our ministry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the mouth of her mouth, the word "butcher", even the whistle can not help but cold and sweat, do not understand the two years of Augustine and heresy rulings have made another terrorist feat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large group of bishops swallowed a sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hope that the "cute" young Master Augustine is the fourth giant of the future. Don't hear the stupid conversation he has just made. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;??????<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sister Charlotte is a St. John's Cathedral The general white priest, who has been determined to be dedicated to the omnipotent master since he was a child, has been responsible for the library books in the cathedral for 16 years. Although she is only a small nun who is destined to be in the history of her life, she is also a big From the corners of the church, many of the upper-class people are either deep or majestic but far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old shepherd always likes to sit on the thick bookshelf of the library without being disturbed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally I saw several red archbishops walking in the cathedral. The old people always dragged a red robes and walked meticulously, as if Being shackled by anything in the world, nature will not notice the inconspicuous Charlotte in the distant priests who are slightly bowed and sullen and awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a special mention of the young man who was once the youngest priest of the empire, Napoleon, always holding a little white cat on his shoulder, he is The only big man who passed by Charlotte and smiled, the biggest worry was that Charlotte, who had too many freckles on his face, jumped for many days. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cathedral is large, like a maze. Charlotte, who has lived for 16 years, will go the wrong way at some point, so her main task today is to give some The great man from the Holy See who came from outside the emperor led the way. She is glad that her words and deeds are strictly in line with the doctrines of the doctrines. The meeting is about to be held, and she will return to the huge library work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning, it is a long marble corridor with beautiful patterns on the ground. If no one is present, Charlotte will secretly playfully lattice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, no one is today. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sunny day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Charlotte jumped out of the first step, she immediately dared not move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because a figure appears at the end of the corridor without warning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white priest’s robe that does not stand out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe because of the angle, the light scattered by the sun shines through him through the delicate stone pillar, and blooms behind him, which is especially embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly went to Charlotte, his eyes were calm, his mouth was hung with a smile that was definitely not a nobleman, and he remembered Charlotte the first time. The cathedral unanimously believes that one day will become the leader of the Holy See, Napoleon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Isn't the meeting room not far from here?” the young priest asked softly, courteous and serene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte mechanical nodded, at a loss. She found that the priest who inadvertently saw her rash behavior was not gorgeous, but rather old, perhaps because the cleaning was too many, it appeared to be faded, but it was clean and tidy, it was a poor Ordinary priest? Charlotte was slightly puzzled and relieved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you give me the general direction?" The young man smiled slightly. "It’s too big, beyond my original imagination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte smiled and pointed out the right direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is certainly not an aristocrat or a big man, because the old nuns say that both people are the least likely to admit that they are inadequate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your guidance." The young priest whispered and painted a standard gesture of the Vatican in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte also rushed back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devout and peaceful young priest seems to be inconsistent with the heavy atmosphere of St. John's Cathedral, but Charlotte did not think much, maybe just a name. Come to the monks who borrow books in the library? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passing by. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was turned from a corridor full of warm sunshine into another corridor that had never been seen by the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlotte turned his head intentionally or unintentionally, but this time he saw a back that made her unable to say anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White robes hem gently swaying regularly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farther and farther away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually plunged into the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic of Charlotte turned, his hands loose, accidentally lost his hand and dropped a book in his arms on the ground, the book spread out across the marble On the right, in the middle of a purple flower drawing, she bent down and saw a line of words, that is the end of the "Ayo Yangge 13". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
