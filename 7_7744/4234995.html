			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Swan Lake Manor has begun to prosper, the Zodiac Magic Circle has gradually improved, more precise and ambitious, anyone can feel the ambitiousness of the young giant. Especially the members of the Greenspan family who came to look at the White Elephant Castle were shocked by the scale of this large dark magical array. The new arena will be completed soon, and there will be countless dark species on stage, destined to be more bloody than the Mississippi Arena, which was demolished by someone. Of course, the most important thing is to be safer, in the only leader of the Marceau County. Watching an unfair competitive fight, just like a big lord whipping a serf in the territory, who would dictate? The astrology building named Dracula's tooth also began to climb up to the sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underground kingdom, below the poetry song, more and more close to the sacrament, just the undead knights with only one skeleton left to feel Chilling, the order began to rule the Marceau County. Under the temptation of heavy money, the informant smelled delicious, and the endless heresy was dragged into the torture hall of the poetry song. Good luck, go to the confessional room, but don't count on the poem The castle goes out, works and contributes according to the individual's areas of expertise, pursues those thought points to redeem, and is unlucky, sorry, the Yangjiao Lab is waiting for you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of the great knight Hera to help Mrs. Quentin has completely failed to meet Augustine, under the bed, so Augustine picked a black swan lake not far away Silent valleys are usually prayed in the early morning, returning for two hours, and leaving the poetry song castle again at dusk, where Augustus, whose nuclear capacity is immeasurable, can be unscrupulously constructed and destroyed. At dusk today, the Grand Archon official walked out of his underground country alone, along a half-circle lake slate path, and then through a reed wetland, the sunset glowed on the young man, it seems that the weight of the light is heavy, he walks more than ever It is slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin holding a screaming staff came to a huge valley full of sorrows. Before the nuclear plaque was liberated, Augustine could only rely on some partial doors. The ancient magic is the winner, so there is very little description of this "red glove" playing tricks in the secret archives of the night watch. It has always been known for its simplicity and efficiency. Now that the rich is rich, Augustine can finally enrich the theoretical knowledge for twenty years. One by one put into practice, standing at the bottom of the valley, holding the high-quality magic wand sold by the Pope's antique shop, Augustine easily set off a "sigh of the mother of the earth", the tremors on both sides of the valley, the rocks rolling down, and then being used as targets, being countless The flame promenade was cut into small gravel, and it was fixed by the "stagnation" characteristic of the arcane in the center of Augustine, which became the basis of the Irish tombstone "tombstone". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magic, Arcane, Undead, in one go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a mysterious figure at the top of the valley, tall and burly, nearly two hundred centimeters of bull physique, but on the back of the head is a single bundle of twists that even the last clown dislikes Hey, licking one eye, but not blindfolded like a Viking pirate, unobtrusively let the onlookers see the hollow of his right eye, hands and fingers dry and thin, shaped like contact with black magic and alchemy too much The Necromancer, with a yellow-skinned sheepskin book under his arm, strangers stared at Augustine with only one left eye, and pulled away the dry lips. The usual gloomy tone: "The nuclear scorpion is as deep as the sea. Are you cheating all the people in the night watch? No wonder the old man doesn't like you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looked up, looked awkward, walked up slowly, and smiled and greeted "Ulysse, is it to tell me that you have become the new gatekeeper of the empire? This is good news. After all, the temperamental Wilde wants to divide me all day, but you are willing to discuss with me the Dead Sea. Volume, we may not be friends, but from It’s not an enemy, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-of-a-kind one-eyed man’s faceless voice, humming and hoarse: “Juggernaut Wilde became the new leader of the night watch, you are the most Some headaches, I have to sit in that position, are you looking for an opportunity to assassinate me? Little Augustine, and you think I will come to your leader circle alone, give you this opportunity to marry me?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shouted: "That is, you were expelled from the superior Wald? It’s unfortunate."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The eccentric man of Lisse screamed and laughed: "Can you stop your magical silence? This is not a ritual to receive guests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled There is still no frankness. For this one-eyed dragon, which is notorious in the whole Vatican, he always hopes to kill himself. I believe that Ulisse has not forgotten how to take his body to collect, and Wilde’s rudeness. Not pleasing, but Ulysse’s belly is black, but even the gold spears The shield was frowning. Ulysses was originally a pastor of the Holy Spirit Chamber. He was brilliant. Later, because he touched the taboos of the Holy See, he could cast a sin in the ruling. It is said that the right eye is the Shield of the Lord. The gold spears were stabbed and finally escorted by the Teutonic priests, and they escaped the fate of mortality. The Teutonic giant was the creator of the Lucifer laboratory. In fact, many specific details were made by this weirdo who liked to sleep in the undead bell tower all the year round. Responsible, a few years ago, he even made a horrible "Dead Sea Document" out of thin air, trying to rectify the traitor Judah, causing the panic of Vatican and the anger of the two Holy See, especially the latter, the Pope. At the cost of up to 12 million redemptive sins, he asked for the head of Ulisse privately. This price is second only to Dr. Saxon, the "black emperor" razor who escaped, so a collection of geniuses and freaks, adventure visits The poetry song, is it not to appreciate the black swan in the lake? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse turned his head and looked at the direction of the emperor. He said: "The old man is really dead this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Augustine knows that this is a fact that will happen sooner or later, but Speaking from the third person of the night watcher, Ulyssey, still feels unstoppable shock. The old man, the Teutonic priest, the old parent of the Windsor family, is the only leader among the three giants of the Ministry of the Holy See who does not resist aging and death. This old man, together with the sacred spear and an ewes, has created a beautiful Byzantine court. The dark cage of the Inquisition, on the battlefield under the table, won the precious dark voice for the Holy Empire. Augustine had seen the old man twice when the night watcher climbed up and climbed, unlike the high spear of the holy spear or the hero of the sea. The danger is that the old man who retains the priesthood of the Holy See is a very cheerful and warm elder. He is approachable. The night watcher has been circulating such a very sunny and welcoming rumor. A new red glove comes to the headquarters with his luggage and reports to the elderly. As a result, the old man spoke very well to help lead the way, and took the initiative to help the young man lift the suitcase. Afterwards, the young man realized that the old man was standing at the apex of the sacrament with the sacred spear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse first showed a sentimental sentiment, gently said: "Maybe the old man forgot, the arrogant young man that year was me." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin finally turned the corner, followed Ulysse’s jumping thoughts and asked, “Do you let the old man carry the box, is it you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysse nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine tentatively asked: "So is Wilde now our common enemy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ulysse looked slyly: "You guessed it wrong. It wasn't Wilde who became the new night watchman of the empire. It was a child, a secret card from the Windsor family of 'the hotbed of conspiracy'. The old man didn't mention me from beginning to end. Yes, this is my most angry place. In addition to my being expelled, Unwilling Wilde is also imprisoned at the bottom of the confession church. All this, the planners are from the 'nanny' behind my child, my half daughter, she unites The rest of the children in the Lucifer laboratory betrayed me. I am not angry with this. I am very pleased, but I am gratified to see the growth of my children. As a father, I still hope to live longer. Little Augustine, Believe you, there are two giants, all of whom are eager to see this scene. The watchman who has no old man is very young."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shook his head: "For politics, served as emperor His teacher’s Teutonic giant is more proficient than everyone else, the child, and her, the future will be the nightmare of the sacrament, believe my speculation, Ulysses, this, I should have a say than you. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse smiled and said: "I reserve my opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin asked: "Why did you choose order as a refuge? As long as you hand over the "Dead Sea Documents" draft Byzantine, the Holy See will open the door for you, treating you as a VIP, and even giving you a position in the Pope Hall no less than the night watchman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uli The plug gave a lame explanation: "I hate the cross."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin asked: "I am angry with the new night watchman of the empire, what reward can I get?" Urise replied: "You need a shadow prime minister who is smarter than you, to help you take care of a truly solid and independent dark country, and you can't find it." To such a talent, now, I am coming."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine sneered: "Does a kingdom need two managers?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse from the channel: "The proud Holy Spirit, the cold ewe, the new night watcher can not accommodate, but you can So I chose the order with unlimited potential."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin squats, cuts a licorice, puts it in his mouth and chews, "Ulysse, I am now I don't like adventure, so you have to be disappointed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse, known as the "Dragon in the Dragon Watch in the Bell Tower", screamed, Kneeling with Augustine, "Then I have to be a ghost in the mainland map. It's a pity that order may never be above the three ministry."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine is indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse stretched out a finger and played the next licorice, and the plant instantly withered, gently said: "Before I leave the Holy Empire, I will go to the Holy Spirit." The court and the ewe sent a letter detailing the source of the woman’s surname behind the imperial new night watchman. Bourbon, hey, is a vulgar surname.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine stopped chewing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysse closed his left eye. "I smelled the breath of the Irish imperial mother's lair, Little Augustine. I didn't expect your accomplishments in the past two years." I have improved so much, but I am reminded that even if you can successfully launch the mother nest, the strength of the current poetry song will not leave me until you wake up the servant of the sur. Escape from the round of thirty high-ranking judges to this small manor, of course, can easily escape outside the manor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine had no choice but to sigh and had to stop the "small" movement that he thought was quite secret. Ulysse is different from the magical stalwart of the Teutonic giant. It is also different from Wilde, who is a sword saint. He has always been a scholar in the night watch. He can only find out from some semi-destructive documents that this is a If you are not the case, you will be ignorant of the wisdom and political mind of Ulisse, even if you are the chief aide of the court. This is a rosette at the top of the bell tower, known as the "Dragon Nest". The one-eyed geek is shrouded in thick shadows. It seems that no one can explore his heart. Even the sacred spears who have driven him out of the Holy Spirit Chamber have publicly regretted that it is not a wise move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin had to make a compromise and tentatively gave the deal: "Ulysse, I will not stop you from leaving the poem, and even give a certain degree of shelter." Until the night watcher stops chasing you, but you have to keep the secrets of Bourbon for me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulse sighed: "You still don't want to Accepting a wise man, the old man should have the temperament that a big executive should have."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shook his head: "I don't want to accept you, but Order does not accept conspiracy and politics. It is not something I am good at."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulisse smiled and said: "Understood, this is the Rotong Chald family. Good traditions, the best gamblers, never come to the table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin followed and laughed, "Thank you for your understanding."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulse stood up and hesitated and asked, "Augustin, are you really thinking about it? I am alone. The whole claw, I believe you are well aware, this is not "<br /> <br /> & nbsp in self-praise;. & Nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Augustine look firm and remain silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulose smiled and slammed on the ground and picked up some stones of different sizes, saying to himself: "I simplified the rules of the arms." The tedious Paya war chess, but has not been able to find a suitable opponent, the little guy, do you have time to listen to it? This piece, for me, is more proud than "Dead Sea Scroll". Pai war chess Too big, including twenty-one occupations, in addition to a single king, queen and prime minister, there are three generals and archbishops, not to mention prosecutors, general priests, magicians, knights, civilians, the total number of 214, Very interesting numbers, right, Augustine, not stupid?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night watcher, the first time I met the one-eyed dragon in the tower of the undead, it was the severely excluded Augustine who was asked by the superior to go to the "Dragon Nest" to request a approval. Everyone knows that the red gloves can be lucky. The body is completely returned from the clock tower, and the sullen Ulysse will judge the unlucky subordinates of their own thinking according to their own bad tastes, just like the sphinx monster who learned many riddles from the goddess of wisdom in the mythology. Finks, once replied, will suffer, and Augustine is no exception. He is asked to answer a difficult question, involving the ancient school Stoic's bodyism, and Augustine is going to circle with the more ancient Laukuk school principle. The two men are in a dilemma, and Ulysses is not pursued. He continues to come up with an unsolvable paradox of Aokang. Augustine is very rude to say that this is just a meaningless replacement of linguistics. I laughed once and reluctantly recognized the saneness of the little guy. After several occasional encounters, Ulisse was willing to take some mathematics. Xiaolezi test school Augustine, the latter did not let him down, and even can say, gave a fantastic answer beyond imagination, but these episodes do not mean that the relationship between the two is harmonious, Augustine does not expect to find in the night watchers The backing, because Ulisse is a horrible freak, and the master of the dragon's nest, the arrogant words are widely circulated: I am the king, monopolizing the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Ulyssey privately said to Augustine a less gentle whisper: Little guy, hang up early, I will collect the corpse for you, so collect your Smart head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does Augustine have the heart of this metamorphosis? This seems too difficult for the young Grand Executive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulse is a guy who never thinks about the feelings of others, just immersed in his own world, and as he said: I am the king, monopolizing the truth. He put out sixty squares on the ground and said to himself: "My war chess has only six occupations, kings, queens, cities, bishops, mages and soldiers. It should have been divided into black and white, but the venue is limited, so After all, the character rules are roughly similar to Paya, but the Queen of the Card gave me inspiration. I decided to give the Queen a bigger space for the chess. She is no longer limited to walking 1 square. As long as it is not the second, everything can be. There is no limit to the horizontal skew and the number of steps. Another change is that the most insignificant soldiers can change to become all characters except the Queen after reaching the eighth grid. How is it a very interesting rule?" Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looked down at the simple board and thirty-two pieces, his face calm, just stopped the action of chewing licorice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
