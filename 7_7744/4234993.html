Conservatives are frustrated. When the tall woman sat at the desk, she finally had time to repair the slightly broken frame, which would damage the dragonfly. It was not a simple matter of wrestling. A vase was placed on the desk and a bundle of the Academic Affairs Office was destined. Looking for flowers that could not be traced, Hais, who was standing in the office reporting work, couldn’t help but blink a few more eyes, but this did not prevent her from clarifying the summary of the affairs of the Academic Affairs Office for more than half a year. She determined that it was a bunch of purple. Silk flowers, flowers falling into the dust of the empire history. In the sacred empire, the nobility knew the aster flower, because of the Rotong Chald family. The civilians know that this kind of flower likes to grow in poor soil with poor environment. As long as a seed is planted, even a narrow stone seam can bloom green shoots. If it is planted in a greenhouse, it will not be bright. Therefore, the aristocratic garden does not accept aster flowers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful and beautiful Miss Haizis came from a medium-sized family in the Imperial City. She entered the imperial aide institution with good education and excellent knowledge, and was finally seen by the Chief Secretary of State as a teaching affairs. The middle-level bureaucracy, the position is not high, the salary is only the eighth, but there is no suspense of the Secretary of State near the waiter, the Holy Empire is not like the Gorse dynasty and the Western Continent, the court in the palace is not overwhelming, and can never get from the Emperor Get the right to speak, so the Academic Affairs Institute has become the best springboard for the young elites of Jupiter City. It has become the first choice for the heirs of the small and medium family of the Imperial Capital. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Gesell slowly put on her glasses, and the whole person’s temperament was instantly rich and strong. On the battlefield, she would not wear this pair of scorpion glasses. In the Battle of Titan's Ports, the man's reckless Odin's hammer gave a crack, but for this kind of episode, the Chief Secretary of State was reluctant to care, she looked up and said: "Haysz, "Blind "Is the Eyes" finished?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clerk who was nicknamed "Small Secretary of State" in the Academic Affairs Institute and has many pursuers smiled and said: "All are looking at the third It’s all over.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Gothic rarely asked for some personal questions during the heavy work, which showed that he was treated with a clean and diligent duty. Unusual treatment, asked: "The travel diary of Napoleon's priest "A thought reed"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notes honestly said: "I don't plan to read The kind of beautiful lyrical chapters don't seem to suit me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb Sp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State smiled and nodded, picking up a booklet that was purchased on the way back to Emperor's Road. The title of the book is more unique than Napoleon's wonderful travels, just a number, thirteen. I heard that in terms of sales volume, I have pressed "Flowers and Blood" together with "Thought Reeds". It seems that the Empire will remember that alternative fat person for a long time. In this regard, Queen Gesell has support for this, an empire that likes forgetfulness cannot win the respect of its people. The title of "Thirteen" comes from the thirteen rules of the Knights of Rhein-Hattai. It is a book published by the Empire. It is said that the book is not accurate because it is not heavy, more like a booklet, only The thin 92 pages, a total of thirteen chapters, starting with each group rule, listed the short life of Iron Oak Knight Rhein Hatha, the protagonist's papers submitted to Morgan College were carefully printed, but the last chapter, left A lot of blanks, only a short six words: we are not alone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heasz whispered: "There were three heroes in the Empire in two years, but two of them came from the Rothschild family, if you add "Blind In the Eyes, the old man Ji Jude..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of the song interrupted the words of the note officer and said: "These things can only be put in my heart. Don't hang on your mouth. History will prove everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graceful Haisz gently left the Office of the Secretary of State and went to the window at the end of the corridor in a complicated way. Secretly made a throwing gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black swan lake that was forgotten by the poet in Maso County became a veritable black swan lake. This year, a large number of black swan inhabit the lake and the ground is gloomy. The manor adds a lot of warm tones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poetry song castle ground building has been completed, the brand new Notre Dame Hall ushered in the owner of this independent kingdom, the order of Augustine, just without any welcoming ceremony, did not get The permission of the "underground king", no one dares to make more words and do one more thing. The huge oil painting "The Tears of the Virgin" slowly opened in the hall, revealing a spiral staircase. Augustine whispered: "Dimit, you should be able to sleep peacefully this time, I am sorry to interrupt the pace of your promotion to the true ancestors several times." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow, there is a magnetic voice: "Master, is there a leap in the world that is more conducive to the growth of a long-lived species than a holy knight?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin doesn’t take it for granted: "If it is not the loyal Ted’s complete body is not conducive to carrying, I will not give you this opportunity to eat. I don’t know Aris’s bag. Can the dry semi-finished products make the horns the apex of the skeleton knight, the hell king, but I think it is unlikely."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dimit went straight to the bottom of the cemetery to hibernate, and became a true ancestor one day earlier, more than all praise to make the owner happy. Augustine stopped in front of St. Ulban and told Ares to send the body of the sacred knight with spices and spar to the horns. The Lich King, Naples, consciously went to the sixth floor of Paradise Lost, where some of them were held. For the surviving dark species, the Lich King is happy to carry out some small experiments that are stipulated by the owner. So Augustine is left with only the female elf Heyman, and the fallen elf who turned away from the forest goddess will lose the innate gold color of the eyelids and turn into a shameful dark green. Heyman is a low-level that even the twelve elf queens have not seen. The elf, who can live to the underground castle of Shi's brother, if Lolly butler sees it, will surely be so slick that Augustine is interested in the plump butt of this female lower creature. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin, holding a notebook, came to the concentric circle and hesitated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin moved his footsteps and said, "Go to the study room."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study, Augustine first put down "Flowers and Blood" and the black rabbit puppet, spread out the map, and then placed 42 Titan badges one by one on different positions on the map, indicating that Mrs. Quentin could speak. Although some hate the existence of the female elf, since the cautious order is long and the secret is unknown to the third party, she is not ruthless. It is straightforward: "According to your request, I urgently created six mechanical birds to monitor the black. Over the swan lake, on the 21st day of your departure from the poetry castle, you finally caught a bee from the Vatican’s secret system. As you wish, I took the password characters on the notes and then let go. The gadget, the next six months, the mechanical bird has captured six bees, and I took the time to decipher the translation, which is the secret of the Yangjiao Lab."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustine flipped a few pages and smiled dumbly: "This is the black sheep's advanced password, have you cracked it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin: "Whether it is Mechanical birds, or passwords, the Pope’s Office seems to be 50 years older than the Byzantine Holy See.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin does not justify this, just in a good mood Let the female elf knead the shoulder and smiled: "Then you talk about the results. If I am satisfied, I will add up to fifteen thought points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin’s thoughts on poetry songs mean that the weight of life is not I value it, but I am a little happy in my heart. I got the first recognition of this scrupulous consul. He said: "This leaker is very embarrassing. It conveys information six times, covering all three independent laboratories of lily, rose and rose, and the information is displayed. It is the core information. From this point of view, it is impossible to obtain evidence from the chief research officer, Miss Yi Yi, Professor Shirley and Kim’s assistant, who are the real enemies, unless they are all the mother of the black sheep. However, after sorting out the information, I found an interesting proportion. Miss Say’s Sayuri accounted for 31%, and Kim’s assistant teacher’s rose accounted for 29%.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine gently said: "So the spear pointed to Professor Shirley, obviously."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin smiled a little, a little proud. Who said she was just a big breasted woman? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin got up and said: "You stay here, I am going to chat with the Shirley professor who is not happy with Haiji in the ewe." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chat is not public, it is in Shirley’s private room filled with Tamei Gallery style. Like the first time alone, Professor Shirley cooks himself. A cup of Ceylon black tea gave a long order, tea was lingering, and Augustine quietly finished a cup of tea. This made Mr. Quentin's research results. It was very unexpected. Professor Shirley looked calm, no panic, no anger, just eyes. There are some small sorrows, and sigh gently: "You are not a big man who likes to listen to others, are you?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin ordered Nod, no expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Shirley sat quietly in a beautiful, slender chair, took off her glasses, and closed her eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin helped her put on her glasses and looked at the beautiful face full of surprises and confusion, softly saying: "Order needs a willing poem? Professor Shirley, who is lonely in the underground world, and I need to come here from time to time to have a cup of black tea that tastes good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Shirley shed tears but never cried Quietly said: "Do you believe me?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine smiled. "I only believe in the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Shirley smiled brightly. "I think I fell in love with you, the wise young Master Augustine!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin got up and said: "After that Black tea should be better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the three labs, Sayuri, who has consistently ranked first, Augustine found the chief research officer who tied a ponytail Miss Yi, invited her out of the underground kingdom to the top floor of the poetry song castle, and enjoy the peaceful lake view of the Black Swan Lake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin gently said: "Thank you Miss Yi Yi for the time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Yi Yi chose silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looks at the black swan in the lake, the third group of guests of this manor, and the only one that is not hostile to poetry The guest, with a little self-deprecating said: "I also stayed at the bottom of the night watchman, knowing that the little people will always sigh the injustice of fate, no matter how struggling, they can not climb the throne of the light, even the bottom line of survival needs big people Alms, but I think that compared to the sacred spears, who are never tired and never wrong, the first priest who is so old that he may lie in the cemetery, and your moody haiji adult, An advantage that no one can deny, I respect your contribution. If you take out ten pieces of bread, I will give you ten copper plates. I feel good, and I don't even mind eleven."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calm Miss Yi finally asked: "Why didn't you doubt Professor Shirley?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin turned Looking at the delicate face that is not glamorous, said: "I Get a cautious mindset with attention to detail. Your mechanical bees that climbed the ground on the girl mage, once opened, will destroy some kind of small switch, so when the bees return to the underground castle for the first time, you know that they are caught. Arrived, but you are very smart, not only did not stop, but cleverly quietly increased the leak of the Rose Lab, if I am you, will also make the same conspiracy. In fact, the person I did not doubt at the beginning is you, Because everyone knows that you are a talented person in the Ewe, and Professor Shirley is wearing a coat that is not in harmony with Haiji. The more I do, the less I trust the latter. This is called reverse thinking. Simple, but often very close to the truth, but this time, you gave me a big surprise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talented chief research officer approached the window, saying Self-speaking: "I am an orphan, adopted by Haiji adults. Before I entered the ewe, I have been living quietly like a normal girl until I showed good memory and divergent thinking, and then began to change my destiny. Therefore, I have no complaints, an orphan can have a happy childhood, it is worthwhile to repay the whole cheap life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin draws a The bourbon silver coin that I carry with me all the year round, nodded: "Understand."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Yi Yi first smiled at the big executive, apologized: "Sorry, Unable to be loyal to you, wise and orderly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second time on the same day to be praised as "smart", Augustine smiled and put away the silver coins," You remind me of a person, you are very similar. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Yi Yi whispered: "Don't kill me? You are not a big man who is used to betrayal and tolerance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shook his head, "You, and A few people in the order, I am willing to exchange all your talents for an unwise betrayal. Another reason is that you remind me of that person. I want to thank you. But I don’t want to see you next time. I received such a surprise. Miss Yi, you have already paid a life for the ewes. Maybe you think that the reward is not enough, but who will really refuse to survive? It is a very lucky thing to live, believe in the sea. Ji Daren will understand your next silence. I don't want you to betray her as a mother, but just hope that you can respect your life. When a child can walk, he should respect himself. Maybe it sounds very sincere, but This is indeed my true heart, you know, rather than saying that I don't like to see betrayal, I don't like to preach with strangers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Yi Yi softly : "Can give A little time to think?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin refused: “No. You must give your choice right away! My good mood and patience are now limited. I was afraid that I couldn't help but throw you into Miss Elizabeth's glass bottle and become a food for some things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Yi Yi shook her head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin sighed, really a stupid girl who didn’t understand compromise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First with a stubborn chief research officer to the study, because Augustine wants to bring a puppet and books, that is a gift to Lolita butler, to honey The lady's boudoir, put down the black rabbit puppet and "flowers and blood", Augustine is ready to throw this young fool into the glass, do not doubt whether the big executive will be so cruel, the beautiful woman who died in the night watcher butcher is not A small number, and in the last six months, the lady who died in the assassination and the lady of Fengqi were also able to count several times. At the last moment, Miss Yiyi opened her eyes and said, "Do you remember me?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin reached over her neck and lifted it up, and immediately threw it into a glass urn that opened the lid and shook her head: "No, the enemy of death, Without this treatment, not to mention that you are not beautiful, it is difficult for me to remember."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she could not speak, she began to struggle fiercely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine had no pity, and she threw her directly into the glass and re-covered it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the high transparent glass enamel, Miss Yi Yi began to suffocate her pain, her face began to distort, her hands were slap on the glass, and her eyes were full of mourning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Augustine stood quietly, staring at the slow passage of her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds before her coma, Augustin sneered a little, opened the lid, raised her glass and fell to the ground, "forgot the glass." The original owner, the Lich King, Naples is no longer there. I have to help Miss Yi Yi to change a cemetery."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Yi, who was lying on the ground and coughing, screamed : "Don't!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin squats down and looks like it: "Don't be like this, Miss Yi, too weak, in my impression, you are A brave man who faces death is far more than a young lady who lives in wisdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Augustine is about to hold her neck again, the chief research officer of the mental breakdown is loud Crying, "I don't want to die!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stroked her silky white neck, like a poor young white swan, smiling brutally: "Don't want to die ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She grasped the hands of the big ruling slender, and cried in tears: " Think!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin opened her hand and thought about it. "That gives you a chance. Not so beautiful, Miss Yi, please take off your clothes. Self-consolation, show me that if you reach the high tide in ten minutes, I will consider letting you continue to live. The poetry song castle is too boring, I have to find some little fun. I have brought it. A female elf comes back, but that kind of catharsis will affect my knight's source."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is almost crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the fourth giant of the Imperial Ministry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin patted her face and reminded me: "I count three times, don't take off, but I will send you to another glass trip." There are dark species that I don't even know."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten minutes later, the order leader walked out of the room with a smile, followed by Miss Hui Yi, whose face was flushed and her eyes were dim. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the order has found a lot of fun, and the fallen chief researcher has ushered in an endless nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days later, Augustine went to the Sayuri Lab and lost his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Yi Yi went out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After half an hour, the dissident chief research officer returned to the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next month, every few days, Miss Yi Yi will go out and report on the progress of the laboratory. This has become a routine practice in Lily Lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alpha City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small college under the Maso County Magic Guild, the magician Don Juan-Golan is teaching, this is always a magician who forces students to accept some weird theories. It’s really unpleasant, if it’s not his father, Lao Guolan, who is a well-known court priest in the emperor’s capital, the guilds of the Marceau County have long let this guy who is not doing business go out, and there is no banquet in Alpha City. Master Tang Yan did not invite the violin solo. In the sacred empire, the mainstream is the "king of musical instruments" piano, which has been rejecting the fiercely developed violin for nearly a hundred years. Even though this instrument is known as the long-lost musical instrument queen, the sacred empire is unpopular, so the violin skills are brilliant and smooth. Master Tang Hao has always lacked a friend in Alpha City. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the classroom, a young man dressed in Damascus costumes attended the audition and had a low-grade perennial grass badge on his chest. This is probably the way he can enter the college. For the root cause, Master Tang Yan was delighted that his course could attract the audience. He specially modified the content of the scheduled lectures and explained the fascinating "Mante's Latin Elemental Incitement", which was used by him. I applied for a three-level Sugencao paper from the County Magic Guild, but the review team even gave the unqualified score, so that the young Master Tang, who was bent on the gold clover, was very hurt. The stranger who is one level higher than him is a good observer. When Tang Yan talks about the most quintessential theory, the young man will nod his head in a tacit understanding, the classroom is not big, the magic intern resources of Alpha City Very scarce, far less abundant than some counties in the east, not only Alpha, but the number of interns who are admitted to St. Carroll College each year in the entire county of Maso County is at the bottom of the empire, which makes the county governor and the magic president Very embarrassed, more than a dozen interns in the classroom are very curious to look at the man sitting in the last row, the eyes are mixed with envy and envy, very young to get the third-level perennial grass, very great look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably it is rare to meet someone who knows himself. After the class bell rings, Don Juan is still not willing to end the course. This makes the magic apprentices feel quite impatient. Some boys with superior family start to whistle. Several girls don’t mind. Turning his head and looking at the handsome man who looked at the window, Tang Hao finally felt happy. When he said the class, the apprentices immediately rushed out. A courageous female apprentice walked to the strange young man and introduced himself. And the man who didn't follow the name of the ceremonial newspaper just showed a smile and said that he was very happy to meet you. This made the young lady from Alpha City come out and jumped out of the classroom with two rich girls. Share this little sweet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’s originally intended to leave the classroom saw the man walking to the blackboard in front of the terminology of the entire blackboard, thinking, but frowning slightly. When he was preparing to go home to practice a violin sonata, he also stopped and curiously said: "Is this Perennial Sorcerer, do I have any errors in the verification of the anthropomorphization of elements by Mante?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The listener smiled and said: "I was the first contact with this Mante Latin theory, but some doubts about being very layman."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Master Tang patted his shoulder, haha ​​smiled: "It's normal! The magic professors in Alpha City can't understand, if you are interested in discovering the darkest but most fascinating field of this magical hall. You can come to me, have an afternoon tea together, have a chance to listen to my violin, yes, I recently just scored a symphony, I highly recommend you to enjoy it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man who was photographed a few shoulders and more or less educated nodded and smiled: "Okay."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The younger Tang Yan, who is perfectly satisfied with vanity, once again swears that this stranger who is willing to accept new things must go to his own home. , This out of the classroom, paused at the door, he turned around and saw the man still standing at the blackboard in a daze, Don Juan's young master better mood, humming a ditty far. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy standing at the blackboard is thinking about it, taking out a charcoal pen and modifying a few wrong formulas, the dean of the college, the deepest tulip in Alpha The magician, Gilbert, was standing at the door, and would rather stand boring and wait, and did not dare to disturb the big man. At this time, the upper empire did not know that Count Dürer was dead and was crucified on the wall, and that The evil gold balance badge is said to be the symbol of the order of the new institution of the Ministry of the Holy Sepulchre, plus the head of the Viscount of Heber, the fat jazz hanged on the angel sculpture in the forest villa of the Cony family, the old Gilber I hope to be the next one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old dean’s heart did not know whether it was the idiot who cursed Tang Yan or should immediately begin to show kindness to this playboy. This answer needs to wait, waiting for the eccentric big ruler Augustine to give hints. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the classroom, the shadow leader of the Maso County who suddenly visited the college said: "Don Juan-Golan is a qualified magician."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Gilber immediately understood that the third-level perennial grass that was squashed by the old men of the guild must be immediately awarded to the fancy young master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big governor who came here alone went away, and old Gilbert regained his sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The northernmost part of the Raven Market, the magicians who came to Alpha to buy advanced magic items gradually recognized and accepted the new Champs Elysees Street, which was monopolized by half. The Witch Street did not raise the price, but provided more rare props on the premise that the price was relatively flat. This is of course a good gospel, so with the passing of word of mouth, the streets of Champs are more and more lively. The behind-the-scenes owner of Half-Women Street walked on the cyan stone road at this time. Before coming to the Champs-Elysees, he went to the Orange auction house. The Count of Marseille was said to have gone to a manor of a noble friend to attend the banquet, and there was a plain from Gogol. The young heirs who came back got a yellow sunflower medal, which is indeed a good thing to celebrate. Augustine came to the pope antique shop, and the young girl who became the new hostess of the store, Agatha, was entertaining an elderly magician. It seems that the old magician who was only planning to buy a common black crystal wand Hey, he was bleeding, and Augustine stood in a brand-new antique shop, and his eyes showed that Agatha, who had excellent eloquence, continued to buy and sell. He picked up a short magic wand made of a dragon core, and waited for Augustine to put down his staff and put on a bottle to sprout. The level of magical hot springs sniffed, the old magician who spent more than 700 Caesar gold coins in a single breath happily left the antique shop, only a year later, Agatha, who was five centimeters tall, did not live up to the same order. Cultivation, the girl shines out of the woman, sees Augustine, and bends with a skirt: "Welcome, long order."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin put down the bottle Magic liquid, said: "You continue."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave the pope antique shop and walk across the street from a store managed by girl Juliet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agatha standing at the door was somewhat lost, but soon he was happy. At the very least, he was the first to visit her pope, not the fake aristocratic lady. Greeting shop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine naturally couldn't take care of this kind of girl who was not hurting. He just turned around in a circle and went to the second floor of the Linhe Bookstore, which was last gathering with Old Rome. He had a snack and was eating quietly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I went to the inconspicuous magic school was that Augustine had promised that the Earl of Marseille would not be in harmony with the court priest, the old man, and that the old fruit would be in the orthodox and The heretical son dragged into the underground castle of Shi's brother, but after listening to the course, Augustine gave up the idea, and the city owner who must rely on the French orange to gain profits would not be entangled in such small things. This lovely count only cares about how many pieces per day. Caesar enters his pocket, Augustine likes to get along with this very pure guy, and of course the Maca fat pig, is a honeymoon friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr., this is the Sudanese black tea that specializes in our guests, guaranteed to be as sweet as Ceylon black tea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin sounded a pleasant voice on the ear, looked up, some amazing, although I did not see the degree of the Titan Lady suspected of Princess Barbara, but in the province of Maso County, it was the first time, see At that time, Mrs. Quentin, who was still the boss of the Pope’s antique shop, was still strong. She was very small and clever. She was only 155 centimeters in shoes. The face was as delicate as a ceramic doll. It seemed to be a touch of a light, and the whole body would be broken. In the crack of a place, Augustine actually likes a relatively slender woman, like a magic teacher in childhood, the Queen of the song on the blacklist, and does not reject such a stunner as Mrs. Quentin, but for pets that are too petite, the sex is very small. But today is a bit exceptional, because she looks so interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin did not hesitate to drink the cup of black tea that was lightly known to put down a large dose of sleeping pills, for a refreshing sour that was once chewed by Bertel For the madman who fights for a long time, this sleeping pill can't make him take a nap, lame to the funny assassin. Even Mrs. Quentin, whose IQ is inversely proportional to her chest, is more than a few times more savvy than her. After drinking black tea, Augustine laughs: “Can you show me your hidden dagger?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was pale and her head was obviously unable to keep up with the big executive’s jumping thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin said to himself: "People who are familiar with me will not be so rash, let me think about family that is not familiar with me but needs to kill me. From Marceau County, Condit? Unlike it, its temper is very good, spit can smile naturally on its face. The violent Todd? Patience will not be so good, those who have been tossed by the Archbishop of Ram The family is not like it. Oh, remember, in the Bliss Bird Forest Villa, there is an unfortunate jazz who bet 5,000 Caesars in the Grizzly gambling. The information indicates that he has a very good looking only daughter. A carefree lady, not very smart, but not stupid, but enough to make her one of the most moving ladies in the county of Maso, but I did not expect you to look so good, your jazz father is a biological father? ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
