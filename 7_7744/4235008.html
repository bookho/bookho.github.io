			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man with a strong Icelandic semi-indigenous language is not a compelling person, his body is round and round, and he is covered in a gray old robe. Inside, but the feeling is not fat, it feels like a big wooden cow in Sicily? This is a very awkward vision. The old man has an old-fashioned face, but the feelings that are temporarily revealed soften the sharp lines of his outline. It is faintly obvious that when the old man was young, he was a man who could barely be called a handsome man. The sword in the hands of any sacred knight is sharp. The old man sees Augustine wanting to get up, swinging his hand, ignoring the strong hostility of the scorpion boy, taking the initiative to sit down and sit down, speaking in a language that Augustine needs to work hard to translate. Language: "Hey, in my hometown, this river has two kinds of sayings. It is said to be a winter road. Winter is coming, spring is not far away. It is very a poet's tone. It is depicted in this myth. It became a hero who did not hesitate to anger the escape of the gods after stealing the fire. The other one is more vulgar. It is a cow that gave birth to the gods. The milk-water that is squeezed out is obviously more appetizing to me."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin's body trembles gently, is a subconscious sense of crisis, if it is the peak period before the robe breaks, with the magician practice belt The control of the spirit, as well as the control of the muscles of the knight and the assassin profession, can perfectly hide this subtle fear. Now, at the bottom of the trough, Augustine has no ability to cover up, but there is an instinct to resist on the limbs and is seen by the elderly. After the more irresistible emotional sentiment is overwhelmed, it is like a child seeing the most severe and rigorous ancestors, afraid of criticism, but not really hateful. Augustine quietly listened to the Icelandic vocabulary that came out of the old man's mouth, and his mind was blank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the family study, I hang a sketch of your childhood, that is the best gift that Alice gave me, when she was in a pile Choosing your father among young people, I am very angry. The most beautiful lady of Constance, the little girl who grew up riding on my neck, married to a man who only raised the quill pen? Later, my daughter gave me Explain that the Luo Tong Chaid family had a ancestor of the Dragon Slayer. Well, my daughter grew up, no longer dependent on my father, and some sad, but after all, I have to leave, and then I feel a blink of an eye, I have A new grandson, I heard that you are going to the Odea Monastery. I wrote a very excessive letter to your mother, saying that I don’t approve of this cowardly grandson. Don’t expect to be The centaur accepted, and then, I had no time to make up for the mistakes. I almost wanted to screw down your father’s head and hang it with the prince in the hands of St. Urban, as for the trade of the Holy Empire with Fermoth. Blockade, just two homes It’s a very childish act, it doesn’t make much sense. The only thing that can stop this empire from standing up is the singular iron ride and the titan’s spear. Remembering you, or the arrangement of this family contender, Turing’s little The bastard seems to pay special attention to you, and I will start to evaluate you again. Augustine, don't expect me to have a good impression on you at first, and to comb the blood of any gold family is a hard work. Especially when these dirty families with sacred coats carry out endless marriage and mating, even if you learn from the Ferdinand Yearbook, which only has a large name, you can understand it. If you don't love Grace's only son, I don't care about your life and death, I reach the three-digit descendants, and many of my names can't be remembered. When I got the second portrait and a pile of heavy purchases, I felt A long-lost surprise, ha, this little guy, really a bit like a half-human grandson, Kepler gallows set up, good, although there is still a distance from the dragon At least young, this is the biggest advantage. The more pure power, the easier it is to crush the wisdom, the latter to ride around under the arm, whether Constance can be ranked in front of Fermoth and Sanuki. Hey, human beings are not relying on debates to defeat the dragons, forcing the dragons to sign the shame of "Moses Commandments", which is a stronger force than the dragons."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man was very talkative. Augustine almost thought that he was the old master of the thinker Fermoth, not the Raytheon who had knocked on several giant dragon heads. In the old top ten gold family, the humble old man around him was The only one who relies on a single strong to sit on the shadow of the throne under the ass. It is said that in his youth, the half-human illegitimate child who made the Viking pirate’s head find a dusk in the ruins of a temple in Iceland. In the left of the Quake, this guy went to the dragon pulse hot hand, killed a dragon, then chewed the dragon meat all the way back to the family, killing all 16 competitors and he has forgotten his existence The biological father. If a single person contends with the 600-strong elite knight is a standard of the sacred knight, then the slaughter of a medium-sized dragon is the existence of a higher plane, but this "final measure" is concealed and general. It can't be quantified like the magic formula. It's like being a Moore Stone Juggernaut and a Knight of the Holy Ghost. There is no convincing standard. Augustine wants to explore. He must reach the gold clover magician or the holy knight. level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin always listens quietly to the old man’s ambiguity, dare not show the words and deeds that will be considered to be contaminated with fancy, but keeps telling the old man in his heart besides The grandfather who did not take hundreds of grandchildren seriously, or the current owner of the Centaur badge, is the biggest butcher on the vast expanse of the epic continent in the northwest. For the grandfather who suddenly crossed the continent to the sacred empire, Augustine did not reject it, but never gave any good wishes. A dangerous Ues cousin made him uninterested in the centaur, but Augustine still saw more. A few eyes on the side of the old man, the previous familiarity, probably the reason why the mother is somewhat like him, the same determination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Augustine was in a daze, the old man groped for a while, pulled out a piece of meat wrapped in greasy cloth and threw it to Augustine, laughing: "There is this left. You can taste it. The Dresser Shuilong is a descendant of the dragon and an ancient golden subspecies. He doesn't like to scrape the treasure, but he is greedy, searching for food in the ocean all the year round, which makes the wine of Dresser the most delicate and delicious. I am getting older now, and the hammer is a little hard, so that a granddaughter who is doing Viking pirates will send me some fresh Dresser each year. This piece of meat is the essence of Dresser, very particular, one knife When you break into the neck of the dragon, you must immediately cut off the food that wraps the heart. It is too early, it will be embarrassing, too late, it will be paralyzed. In fact, the best meat to eat is from the wings of the young Angel Fire Dragon, but Maya I have been protesting with the Golden Rule several times with "The Commandments", and I have not been able to eat it several times in my life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin was dumbfounded, bluntly chewing on Dresser Dragon meat, do not know how to express the helplessness and shock in the heart, this time Long regarded as their own eating meat? Although Dresser is not included in the orthodox dragon spectrum, it is still more cherished and powerful than the general high-grade gold subspecies. "Moses Commandments" is a very humanized contract. Most dragons are imprisoned in four dragons. Once left, they will be chased by the guardians of the dragons, but there are two exceptions. One is the sacred dragon that won the moderate trust of humanity in a long-term temperament and neutral attitude in Capella. They are too close to God is stunned, human beings are willing to pay a little friendliness for this, and the second is an additional treaty for those special dragons: when a total number of dragons is less than or equal to three, they are allowed to leave the dragon's cave in order to complete the necessary inheritance. And dragons to find a partner. There are a large number of dresai water dragons, plus dragons that are not really sensed. They have always been used as food by Raytheon. They are only verbally condemned by some gold families and several secrets. No one wants to succumb to this ambiguity. Especially, I don’t want to annoy and have the strength to bring up the old man of Quake. In the dusk of the gods, the number of artifacts left by the gods of Olympia on the mainland is high. There are eight recorded in the book, and half of them are recorded by humans. But the main enemy of Olympia is the Holy Europe headed by Odin. The gods group has only three artifacts left behind. The power and mystery are beyond the limits of human imagination. Among them, there is the hammer of Quake. The Titan National Treasure Odin is another one. It is said to be strong enough to resist the punishment of God. It is a "The smallest but the most indestructible castle on the mainland." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine ate the dragon meat and spoke for the first time. "Don't you take it with you? Vatican's Lexington seems to be your biggest enemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The old man laughed and said: "Take a few, but they were torn in half when I was in a bad mood. As for the Latter Shield, this is called the enemy of my life by outsiders, I must see that I did not bring a hammer. I understand the simple intention of my visit to my grandson. I didn’t create obstacles. In fact, my relationship with him was not as bad as I thought. I just killed his parents by mistake. He has used the bodies of twenty-four centaur descendants. Revenge me, it is much softer than the grievances of several gold families."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine's face twitched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man regrets: "So I like Turing the kid, it will be a good successor, you will be a little worse, if you come to another Kepler Gallows, maybe I didn't just bring a little Dreiser dragon meat this time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine can only smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man who has been observing Augustine’s subtle expression changes is disappointed: “Augustin, you don’t have any feats worth showing off to the public, talk about it? Maybe I’m Happy, I will give you more meetings. You have to know that I have always been a generous elder, especially for those who are not ashamed of the half-man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Augustine licks the dragon meat, can't taste the deliciousness of this meat, calmly shake his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is a little angry: "It’s not like a half-human grandson, it’s more like a child from the small family of Luo Tongchaide!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin corrects: "It’s not like, it was."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man is helpless: "You grandson, even horse It’s no wonder that the fart will not be filmed. It’s no wonder that Luo Tongchaid’s arrival in your generation has been ruined silently.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stopped to chew and looked into the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no comfort after seeing the grandson, but the old man who was constantly ridiculed smiled and patted Augustin’s shoulder and stopped talking. For this undead old man, there are already too many poetry and personal biography, and there are countless praises and praises: "He is the first human to challenge and kill the dragon so frequently. Human beings are promoted by him alone. "The steps closer to the gods." "After the destruction of the Holy Union of Oguja, all the onlookers said that it is difficult to restore the glory. There are thirty-six small countries standing on the ruins. For the next half century, there is only one lack. The emergence of the great soul, to complete the new unity, the entire Oguja is quietly waiting for the growth of an illegitimate child, the boy's childhood portrait, full of cheeks, messy hair, sharp chin, eyes in the eyes revealing naughty while emitting 骇The fierce light of a man, like a Bohemian swamp geese whose wings have been cut, eventually he came, carrying the hammer of Thor, he is the ghost of the lost, the new master of Constant, the shadow of Oguja The emperor.” The criticism of Raytheon is even as numerous as the blasphemy: “A sacred spirit that relies on the devour of the dragon to grow up, the existing hell can’t accommodate his evil deeds. Open up a new layer of hell." "How many good and innocent people did he kill? Count it! If our sacrifice can be exchanged for this devil even if the life is reduced, I am willing to die immediately, and there will be countless people to do with me. The same choice." "Sin of the sin, its head does not match the urinal!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
