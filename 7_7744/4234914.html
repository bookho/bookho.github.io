			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Six thousand words chapter, collections~)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera-Bolsefol Looking down at the little Mary guillotine in the middle of the square, it seems that the gloomy sky is shining, and the bright red guillotine is warm and sly. She has already put herself on a man like a red-eyed gambler. She found that she not only did not betray the heavy weight of the old faith, but the new faith brought her a strange peace in the first time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the world of knights that seem to be rigid and sinister, the main faith can reflect many of the information of the knight himself. The main source has eight systems, the big knight. Hera once majored in justice in honor. Honor is one of the eight systems. After the collapse of justice and sacrifice, she chose to follow Augustine, majoring in the loyalty of the main system, giving up any minors, which means her future class. The higher the loyalty to Rotong Childe, the higher the loyalty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honours, Loyalty, and the love chosen by Grand Knight Descartes are the most popular sources of faith in the main system, and should have been absolutely in absolute numbers under the illumination of the Holy See. The piousness of the superiority is extremely bleak, even though the great knights in the Knights of the Holy See are often symbolic minors, and the pious knights are the rarest "fools" on the list of the Imperial Knights, which has always been the leader of the Holy See. We are very worried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You might as well try to minor love." Augustine walked through the square into Henry Street and finally stopped, waiting for the horsewoman to stand parallel with him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clever aristocrat will not take the initiative to ask his nephew to supplement love under the premise of major family loyalty. After all, the two are too prone to violent conflicts. Once you deviate from the family of your loved ones, you may directly destroy the Cavaliers' main faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you bring me love?" Hera disdain, she chooses family loyalty rather than personal loyalty, that is, she does not want to be involved with the insidious Augustine. The intersection of the Qing, but it is the despicable shame of the great consul, she has the desire to choose to believe in Luo Tongchaide, she may not be a mature female knight, but also witnessed too many people in the Saxon forest to kill The only heir to the "Savior" of the gladiator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I bring you love, it's hard to say now, but at least I can give it to me. I will give roses from the knight." Augustine laughed. Was waved at a plain girl who sold roses, and the ordinary girl with a shabby face gasped and ran over. Augustine gave her a bourbon silver coin that could buy at least two baskets of bright roses, not to mention the roses in her basket. Not really beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the soil-poor love of the same thin Saxon, Andre's daughter refused to be close to all men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is Herra’s first encounter with a male flower, and it’s still a big deal, but the only imperfection may be hesitant to take it. The horsewoman of flowers, who used to be scrutinized by the poor Saxon, was surprised by the fact that she was surprised and shy. The biggest idea was that Augustine should not waste the bourbon silver coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that Herawan’s choice of family loyalty is a correct way for her to take fewer detours. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hella physically instinctively rushed to Augustine, between Augustine and the flower girl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sharp assassin in the assassin industry must have a sharp Troy dagger to the hand holding flowers Hera, originally this ten-nine-nine venomous sharp dagger should be stabbed Through the heart of the man behind her, Hera smiled in her heart. Is this family loyalty? Unfortunately, I am not a big knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera holds the hand of the flower and gently hangs down to meet the death that she expected to be a little faster than she expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the dagger did not have the ability to pierce the rich breasts that still have her whip marks, she only saw the sinister face with a smile that was distorted instantly, then The female assassin usually flies out of the broken kite. Before the fall, she is smashed into a piece of charcoal by a large string of high-density magic balls ejected from Hera. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hella turned her head and saw a familiar and strange face with a gentle mask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the man who is naked in the compartment and squats on her body? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She converges and frowns: "Why directly cut this clue, maybe you can get valuable information from her mouth."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you know how many people in the empire want me to die in this naive assassination within half a year? In the clockwork orange, at least half of the Marceau nobles bet me in a month The inside was killed. It is said that the emperor underground casino accumulated nearly 9 million Caesar gold coins to pass my exact death message within half a year. The assassin of this series can only be a medium-sized aristocrat who doubted my identity in the clockwork orange. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine smiled, squatting down, picking up a rose falling from Hera's hand, handing it to her, lowering the voice, "I have a detailed list anyway, these nobles, I will clean up one by one according to the principle of proximity, so you I have to hurry to advance, otherwise I will miss a lot of wonderful games."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Hera is stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you know how many assassinations and sneak attacks have you experienced when you walked out of the Augers Castle and the Odea Monastery? 97 times." Augustine lightly said, light He gently raised the collar of Hera's robes. He had a near-deformed possessiveness for the woman he wanted to conquer, so once he was a woman, don't expect to wear God's most enduring life in this life. The tube top evening dress is gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera's face is reddish, but she still looks directly at Augustine and does not back down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like the beautiful pride of a female knight, like a small Persian cat who lifts her head when walking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin squinted and smiled, and the hand that was supposed to be retracted suddenly reached into her neckline, grasping that Hera was not as good as Professor Shirley’s big but good-looking pigeon. Augustine looked at the red-faced shameful face. He didn't lightly pinch it. He no longer had to take a step, retracted his hand, and blinked. "But the Persian cat didn't have the way to make the man willing to fall into the color-sexual chest." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Hera thought about how to teach this honest color - the moment of love, Augustine has successfully transferred the topic, "Okay, we should go to Lolita to buy Some slaves, you picked them by Hera, about 60 to 80 young slaves with good physical condition, plus a dozen children with spell potential, they will be under your jurisdiction, if possible, they will Will be the first youth of our 'order' organization ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must determine what you want to do with them, and what time is it." Heraben is an excellent military conductor, once he is At the battlefield, she can shine with dazzling brilliance instinct. She has now adapted to the transition from a slave to Augustine and from the role of the knight. After all, she can change from a family with Rotongschild to have the opportunity to "purify" the interior of the empire. An aristocrat, this is the career that the Saxon Forest Warriors dreamed of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Initial is to help me construct a rough taboo magic array, very large, definitely beyond your imagination, waiting for you to recover the big Arcane home after 23 hours Strength, I will discuss the details with you, I promise that it is more interesting to you than me.” Augustine laughed, apparently he knew the secret that Hera deliberately hid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slave market on Henry Street is superior in size and quality to Bobby Street. In fact, the big slaves of Lolita are gathered in the north of Lolita, but Augustine is ready to go to the next pocket to go to visit Luo. Rita's "Poppy Flower Market", even Elizabeth knows that there are all kinds of stunners, which can fully prove the popularity of poppies. Augustine intentionally or unintentionally, "That is, Miss Hera can spend my money to save nearly one hundred slaves at a time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are sure to be saved, Instead of depriving them of their last right to life? Since there are so many great people in the empire who want you to die, and Lolita also explained to me specifically how boring and cruel the imperial aristocracy is, you can guarantee that they will be yours. After the subordinate, I was not strangled the next day?” Hera sneered, and although she instinctively chose a path that she did not know was right or wrong, her head remained the most basic sober. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Poor to the vase knight who has re-raised from the mid-level knight, you are just a knight from the knight, shouting a small bastard to Master Augustine!" The mature Lolly, a flirtatious man and woman, slaps on the butt of Hera Bolsefeller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herra, who was scared by Elizabeth’s move, shook, but fortunately there was no rose left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, me, and the wise and beautiful housekeeper of my wise, will not let every copper board be squandered by the imperial aristocratic boring game. Once you reach the Black Swan Lake, it is my main battlefield, and it is not easy to die." Augustine laughed. Although he shot on the spot to kill an unidentified assassin, Lolita had no intention of interrogation. It was estimated that there was a relationship between the Count of Marseille, and Augustine believed that the snobbery had absolute control in Alpha. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Hlatoti Augustin selected 90 desolation knights, the strengths are around 2, the price is of course more expensive than ordinary slaves, this pen The cost is enough to spend nearly 10,000 Caesar gold coins in Augustine, because the slave market that sells knights is famous for its arrogance and paranoia in Lolita, and never cuts the price. In fact, the Cavaliers themselves are part of the cost, which is only about 30%. Next is the big head, like a lot of equipment for the private knight, armor, sabre, horses and other cumbersome items, of course, must also be responsible for their food and shelter, so a county rich middle-class aristocrats can also buy a bite Hundreds of medium-level knights of level 5, but absolutely can not afford a large number of Knights without a separate source of income, so after the 9800 gold coins are out of the pocket, it means that the heavily indebted governor still needs to At least 20,000 gold coins were sold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Elizabeth is of course serious protest, but Augustine looked at the female knight who bit her lip and said nothing, and finally recognized her "wasted" behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog-in-law knight spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin’s face is unchanged, and his heart is cursing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, but Augustine is pleased that Hera has selected 15 potential mages and warlocks for the "order" with the mystery of the great arcane and her keen instinct. The ages are around 13 or 4, and it is still a woman of all colors. This makes the big executives feel that the boring life of Black Swan Lake is bright and bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving in Alpha in the morning, waiting for Augustine to solve the equipment problems of the slave knights, it is close to dusk, less than an hour before the closure of Lolita and the crow market, in With the mighty but uneven jealousy from the team back to the crow market to retrieve the original dilapidated carriage, Augustine proposed a proposal to let Lolita the housekeeper jump, go to the Dunkedun underground market to buy gadgets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Miss Elizabeth jumped in the omnipotent underground market, screaming, and Augustine smiled and covered her, even from time to time to build her Sex purchase advice, not at all annoyed, symbolizing the imperial court's highest dark governor like a miser to accompany another smart loli and the vendors to bargain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hella’s clever brain has been in a state of shock. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I walked out of Dunke Shield, Xiao Loli got the wish to buy the scarce mainland bestseller "Flowers and Blood 2", and a lot of her how to toss at the current stage. She couldn't use the foundation and lipstick, and the whole two big bags. She thought it was interesting that Hera felt very incomprehensible. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do not need to be extremely successful in dragging a double professional master into the "order" and the man in the city of Rotongschild, smiled and helped thing. This kind of man is by no means a purely proud aristocrat or a devout priest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera-Bolsefoller was finally unexpectedly shouted into the dilapidated carriage by this guy, and the carriage of the Alpha Lord was thrown to the more than ten Young children who come to heaven from hell, if they don’t meet an old and weird master, they can’t sit in the carriage of that grade for the rest of their lives. The rose red luxury carriage is spacious enough, and the brains stuffed into so many children still make them feel comfortable. After all, the cages of the slave market are more crowded than the carriages. The girls who dare not move at will go through the initial strangeness and embarrassment, and then play the female-in-law to discuss the handsome and sacred figure in the front carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a group of slaves who may be slave descendants, any nobleman, even a small landowner who is honored by the jazz, is a terrible and terrible presence for them. In Lolita, slaves are taken every day. Send a little Mary guillotine, or drag into the Vanni Office, those bright-colored dignitaries, always smile and elegantly kick Lolita slave into hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dozen do not know how the fate of tomorrow. The girl revolves around a beautiful character with natural affinity and discusses young and handsome new owners with various accents. The two girls in the innermost compartment of the carriage are silent. One of the temperamental girls is daringly stroking a vase of the Earl of Marseille's favorite collection, and the other is shuddering and curling up like a weakness that refuses to get out of the shell. snails. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly a hundred low-ranking knights rode horses and left the Lolita and Crow markets in a glorious gesture that they could not imagine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leader is the little carriage that Augustine is riding. No one is driving, and the horse is still running with aura and wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Loli holds the sequel to "Flowers and Blood" in the carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are not the same as the aristocrats who participated in the jihad." Hera pulled up the curtains from time to time, confirming that this number is not small, but in her eyes, it is almost The zero knight team did not make a mistake. She was a knight with strong sense of responsibility. She did not want to cause trouble to the man next to her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, when you take off the knight armor, walk out of Saxon, and carefully observe each nobleman, you will find that everyone is different from your first impression. Augustine was not excited about Hera’s evaluation. She studied the dark gold dagger who made it easy for Miss Elizabeth to “spit it out” and slowly said, “including the fat knight who has been sentenced to death by morality. Hart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hella is silent, indeed, she is far from having a voice in her side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if you are the most arrogant and brutal aristocrat, there must be stories behind them that you don't know, as long as you have enough time and energy to explore."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin looked up and said that the finger touched the coldness of "Lu Si's knife". "The freckled fat man likes to study the military group structure of the Titan Empire overnight. He is by my side. The research papers written in the years may be thicker and more rigorous than many old professors in the military academy. Moreover, he may stare at a beautiful woman's ass or chest for a long time, but even if the woman takes off her clothes and stands in front of him, he Still able to do not go to bed with them, even I admire him, of course, this does not affect my strength in his ass."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This has nothing to do with me." Hera whispered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The uncultivated vase, if it’s not your knight’s spirit, in the style of Augustine, it will not be assigned to the horse, because he wants the group of tattered knights to follow this The car is running! Perhaps in the eyes of all the nobles in Alpha, it is normal, it is an elegant 'bad taste' that the nobles should have. Do you know the real reason?" Elizabeth squatted in the compartment, looking through "Flowers and Blood", squinting at Hera, she really can't stand the female heresy's ignorance of the current affairs, only the perfect combination of the great queen and the lovely Loli can sneer at Little Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I want to judge the detailed strength of each knight?" Hera frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bingo, you gave the correct answer. It seems that you are not as stupid as you think." Elizabeth smiled, "Bingo" is her muse A very old-fashioned gambling method in the mainland, meaning "you guessed it." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It doesn't matter, anyway, I just want a group of guys who can do physical work." Augustine smiled and looked at Little Loli, "Miss Elizabeth, on the road." There may be a lot of rash guys who hit the gun head, I hope you can reach out to the allies like an empire celebrity."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth really reached out to Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intent to be clear, but give money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading a book like Elizabeth from the last page, sure that "Flowers and Blood" will definitely have a third, so she decided now Start to continue to save money. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old rules, a fly a bourbon silver coin." Augustine can't help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Augustin, you are rich now! Go out of the crow market and you have 68044 Caesar gold coins in your pocket! We have to change the rules from today, a fly A Caesar gold coin!" Elizabeth screamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you give a slight discount and give a reasonable price?" Augustine smiled bitterly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth still pouted and held his hand, saying nothing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"44 gold coins prepayment, this is all my change." Augustine bit his teeth, throwing a bag of gold coins to Elizabeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Loli measured the weight of the purse, let Hera scream with a painful eardrum, and rushed to Augustine is a bite of bitterness, wipe He still refused to give up on his face and said: "There are only 43 Caesar gold coins here, you are a treacherous bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hella looks stiff again . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tough image of the Dark Archon's adult has disappeared in her mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she soon understood why the young Augustine, who was strong in front of everyone, would "succumb" to a small seemingly obsessed with books and lipstick foundations. Loli. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before arriving at the Black Swan Lake Manor, in addition to the advance payment, Augustin owed Miss Elizabeth 34 gold coins. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding together means that she spent the rest of her life in two days while reading "Flowers and Blood 2" and reluctantly "spent time" to solve 78 Only dare to interrupt her reading the flies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hera, who has restored the strength of the great Arcane, has solemnly warned herself that she will not have any friction with the destructive private butler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this time, there was a detail that surprised Hera, and Augustine had quietly made a low-level knight and 15 skill potential for everyone. The girl made a comprehensive evaluation, physical strength, belief, explosive power, nearly ten specific indicators, nearly 50 pieces of white paper just bought from Dunke Shield, full of data and comments, at that moment, can absolutely dominate a Saxon forest The female war god of the medium-scale jihad understands the truth. Even without her, he can perfectly form a young army knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the fine tradition of Rothschild?" Hera couldn't help but ask for a night before a private butler went out to clean up the flies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Half is the tradition of Rothschild, and half is my own habit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Augustine stretched out. "Strategy is God, the details are the devil. The former is taught to me by the sable flower, the latter is my own, but Rotong Childe started from my generation, this is A tradition. Miss Hera, don't underestimate any empire's aristocratic family. There is no glory for no reason, no power for no reason. We can not fear anyone, it does not mean that we can be ignorant and naive. Go to those who are not afraid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
