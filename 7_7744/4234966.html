			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is actually a headache. How to entertain the white robes of the faculty, which is not in good faith, public information shows that the jury has a total of 16 people, title The tallest one is only one of the bishops of the Vatican, and the sensitive point is that the white robes of the priestly family were the high-ranking "Ruuf", the sacred court. The official missionary, this group dedicated to the Holy See to open up a wasteland of faith, is a relatively detached institution that can be respected, and the bishop of Willy, who entered the Senate, is one of the 12 members of the bishop of Rouf. Second only to the "Bishop of the First Rouef", the emperor has always had a good reputation. It is the confidant of the Secretary of State, Queen Gesell, and the rest of the academic staff can ignore it. In the eyes of Augustine, in addition to the exclusive superiority of the white robe priest Feeling, nothing, when the night watchers, they were fed up with the arrogance of these sheepdogs. They did not dare to talk about the giants of the ruling, especially the ewes Haiji adults, even the number of battles of the night watchers. Wilde Marquis number two group of people have eaten bitterness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Augustine only met with the nominal diplomat, Mrs. Quentin, on the Black Swan Lake border, just said a word about whether the meeting could be arranged White Elephant Castle, did not expect them to happily agree without hesitation, presumably all the way to travel, compared to the narrow and shabby poetry song castle, the distinguished judges are looking forward to the comfortable environment of the White Elephant Castle, both Bishop Willian Even refused to walk off the carriage for reasons of physical discomfort, until the iconic white wall of the white elephant castle, Augustine was able to see the true face of the well-known Lueuv, a luxurious white robe, in addition to the bishop embroidered, not to mention There is a family crest and the Medal of Honor awarded to him by the imperial court. The chest is full of dazzling, no less noble than the aristocrats who died in the face of the emperor. As a host of shameless, Augustine seems to have no body frame of the new giant of the sacrament, taking the initiative to go forward. The bishops say hello, which makes Mrs. Quentin, who is not very fond of the Vatican’s Holy See, very guilty, when she has been continually drifting by a dozen judges. At the end of the trial, when the bishops looked at her in line with the creator's aesthetic, there was finally a sign of anger, and Augustine dropped a seemingly relaxed and casual look. Mrs. Quentin immediately turned from a violent lioness. Cheng Yuqiao’s kittens responded to a far-fetched but fascinating smile of the old Bishop’s bishop. If the white elephant castle had already been greeted, the bishops would like to talk to this female diplomat who is far more eager than the young traitor’s son, and must It is her little hand that can be used to express his selfless love for the lost lamb. Greenspan is personally greeted by Miss Alice, and all the aristocratic etiquette is not bad, which makes the barbarians not ritual rumors. The bishops were a little surprised, especially when the trial team stepped into the castle and saw the barbarians feel the squandering of the Caesar gold coins as a copper plate, and they were more comfortable. When they ate the top banquet snacks and black tea, they were originally due to a hardship. The emotions that fell into the bottom of the valley, and the unexpected joy, in their hearts Congratulations on the generosity of the Lord, Augustine did not taste the food, just sitting in the corner, smiling and gentle, slightly restrained, so that Mrs. Quentin could not help but find out why this insidious and insidious magistrate changed his style. Deliberate self-destruction, too strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only one accompanying young knight in the jury team who was not so concerned about the beauty of Mrs. Quentin. More attention was paid to the judges and into the White Elephant Castle. He also like Augustine, who did not eat. Sitting posture is also very military style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice politely smiled and said: "The bishop, according to the requirements of the Grand Executive, has helped you organize a conference hall, ready to negotiate. Of course The rooms are also ready to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the Huis Mountain Range."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishops nodded with nobility, and said: "Alice Miss, you are a lady who doesn't lose any of the emperors. I am happy to go back to Jupiter and personally defend some less accurate rumors."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Miss Alice smiled and said: "My family and I will thank the bishop for their tolerance and wisdom. And I have always respected your great contribution to the Holy See's missionary work in the Rose Principality. I also hope that you will listen to those touching stories. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishops squinted and looked at this barbarian heir who was much more beautiful than the imagination, and said: "This is no problem, Miss Alice." , but we rushed in the night, some tired, want to first "A little bit of interest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice turned her head and said: "Old Asa, with the bishop to go to the room, have any needs, try to satisfy, this is Greenspan’s honour.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishops took the jury to follow the old butler and went upstairs, never talking to Augustin, even The intersection of the eyes did not appear. When the trial team disappeared into the field of vision, Augustine took the teacup, but this cup of tea was given to him by Alice. Alice sat next to Mrs. Quentin, but her eyes stayed softly. On Augustine, Mrs. Quentin sneered with a sneer: "The Lord Archon, it seems that you have no friends in the Imperial Capital, and the word of mouth does not seem to be very good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Augustine drank the impeccable luxury Ceylon Highlands black tea, did not think: "In the empire, I have few friends. As for fame, you can not expect a birth not long after being said in the city of Augsburg How to be a small bastard who bullies a beautiful maid, how to be respected, Kun Auntie, your expectations too high "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Alice Yanzui smile. Mrs. Quentin, known as the aunt, looked annoyed and screamed at Augustine, ridiculing: "Are you left behind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine put down the teacup and squinted at Mrs. Quentin, who was slightly anxious because of her anger. The smile was awkward: "Or else I will cry and cry and ask the bishop to convict me? Aunt Quentin, you should not be Bishop." The young and handsome appearance can be confusing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insane Mrs. Quentin overslept. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Alice couldn’t help but laugh out, indeed, the bishop was “very young and handsome”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a knight went alone and returned, there is not much cumbersome medal on his body, only the attire can only be judged as the Knights Templar The honorary knight, known as the most imposing knight of the empire, each young knight is a qualified lover of the Imperial ladies, when they walk neatly on the streets of Jupiter, the number of throwing flowers is countless. Mrs. Quentin is not focused on the details of the sacred empire, but Alice, who is in the first-line family, has many eyes. The younger Cavaliers embroidered three Cambridge grasses on their shoulders. According to common sense, this is not his age. The amazing glory, because that means that he has won three times the Cambridge merits of the heresy. This is not enough but the full-fledged merits of the empire is only awarded to the knights who have participated in the bloody battle and won great victories. The praise is only one step away. Therefore, this achievement is placed in the position of the deputy head of the Templars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice sees the arrival of the mysterious knight, and she will be able to get up and leave, leaving a brilliant living room to the three. Augustine didn't get up this time. Mrs. Quentin originally thought that she was only because of the identity of a strange knight, but the result surprised her. A young knight with a baby face but a temperament is a standard knight of Augustine. There is no trace of coping, and his eyes are hot. He is respectful and respectful: "Goddes Dragonfighter Knight Fermi Joseph sees the Lord Archon! "This sentence almost made the absent-minded Mrs. Quentin spurt out the black tea, the Gothic Dragon Knights? With the 13-Chrysanthemum Knights under Jupiter’s Majesty, the Cardinal Knights of the Queen’s Academy of Education is one of the three most powerful Knights of the Empire. And this inconspicuous brown-haired youth is the highest-ranking dragon gun knight in the Gothic dragon tongue? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled and said: "I remembered, the daredevil knight who had been licked by me in the Kepler Glyph Campaign?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young knight will smile and be grateful that this man who is younger than him remembers himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine wondered: "You transferred from the Ministry of the Ministry of Education to the Academic Affairs Office?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dragon Gun Knight Fermi nodded: "Currently accepting the second secretary of the Secretary of State, Mr. Saray Commander."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin is not surprised, the only radical leader in the academic school who can compete with the girl, Rachel’s Tiger, has always liked to dig potential knights. And vigorously carrying, in front of this, but almost had the opportunity to enter the emperor's direct Knights. There was only a little doubt. The trial team came to the Black Swan Lake under the inspiration of the woman in the biggest vase of the empire. The second secretary of state and her were not in a camp. What was the knight of the Rachel Tigers, what drove him to join? Judging team? Is it a small arrangement for the tigers that have gained the trust of most of the hawkish military veterans and the new rich families? Augustine contemplative, but did not hinder the appearance of a gentle expression on his face, this change, presumably the dragon gun knight can feel it, only to face the less influential judging panel, the youngest in the history of the Holy See and of course the most powerless black animal husbandry The first is not sincere. Fermi Joseph did not stay for a long time and soon left. Mrs. Quentin asked with suspicion: "Have you participated in the most fierce battle of the Kepler Ganden in the past ten years?" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is not a nephew. She has fled the Science and Technology Institute under the Pope’s Hall these years, hiding under the wings of the barbarian in Maso County, but still being exposed through the knowledgeable Alice. A lot of secrets, the Kepler gallows battle is naturally the main event that can't be circumvented. The war under the ground is mixed with too many hidden forces. It worships the Pope's Hall of the Austrian Holy See, the Ministry of the Virgin of Vatican, 缪The semi-god of the mainland, the name of Judah, the 12th surname, the former underground king of the werewolf, the half-orc, a large number of black magicians, and so on, too much. Augustine smiled awfully: "Want to hear the truth? But you have to serve it with a small mouth, but I guarantee that this secret is worth your effort."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin blushes and swears: "Dream! You are a shameless knight who practices the source of the saints' faith!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine no change, lightly drink tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time, Mrs. Quentin couldn’t stand the strong curiosity and gave her a step back. "You said first."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin swears: "You can't do business at all, or let me hand over the antique shop on the Witch Street."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;Mrs. Quentin gritted her teeth and told herself that she could no longer be lucky enough to be a sergeant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin put down the teacup, it seems to be ready to completely bury the little secret. Mrs. Quentin was finally defeated by herself, and she said with indignation: "Let's say!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin, who was conspiring, smiled slowly and slowly: "The Battle of Kepler The fuse was me, and it was me who ended this disgusting battle. In the end, I took 184 faith points in this battle and almost broke the single record of the Ministry of the Ministry. Let me say so much, more wonderful stories are in When Mrs. Quentin provided the service, I slowly said it to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin was wrong, not knowing whether it was a ridiculous rogue or the absurdity of the truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole day, the jury is more like a sightseeing group coming from afar, eating food, drinking good wine, still under the advice of Miss Alice Out of the castle, I visited the nearby scenery. In short, Augustine and the cosmo, which is no longer in the middle of the hustle, were completely aired on one side. Fortunately, Augustine was on the cliff terrace of White Elephant Castle, and Alice accompanied him. After several hours of Paya war chess, Augustine lost without suspense. He felt the emotion to play this intellectual game. I am afraid that only the dying fat man who is afraid of dying but wearing the iron oak medal is Alice’s. Opponent, Alice once whispered to Augustine whether or not the old Paya war chess, Augustine refused, said that it is meaningless to accept, no one is willing to play chess with him, which makes Miss Alice a little lost, she I would have liked to use this as an excuse to visit the underground castle of poetry. The two stood near the fence and looked into the distance. Mrs. Quentin had never appeared, probably regretting the unbearable "service". Augustine felt the refreshing breeze and whispered: "Why, not ready to let The bishop has seen the most breathtaking sights of White Elephant Castle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice smiled and said: "Do you want it? If you want, I can send an invitation." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shook his head and said: "I don't want this net, don't let the false believers tarnish. I can't wait for all the white elephant castles except me. Rejected."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice squinted her head and said, "Yes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin Turning his head and laughing: "Alice, is your ceremonial officer not educating you with a thorny rose, can you let the aristocratic man moths fight?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;</div>
