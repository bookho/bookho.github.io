			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A carriage drove quietly through the emperor’s mistress, Meso County, without the expensive and beautiful fennel blood horse, without the brigade armor gorgeous ornate from the knight, no prominent The family crest, heading alone to the city of Jupiter, the heart of the sacred empire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy Empire is undoubtedly an ancient empire. It first accepted the Vatican, which was split from Byzantine, and the emperor at that time The fact that this doctrine was rebellious from the orthodox religion as a state religion paid a huge price. The imperial emperor was not only expelled from the teachings of the spiritual epic of the epic continent, but also clearly determined to be heresy. Subsequently, the first shepherd of Vatican Tegang In the case of a tooth for a tooth, the Byzantine Pope is defined as a false believer. This ancient empire has always survived the weight of faith, and because it is adjacent to the Titan Empire and the Kingdom of the Kingdom of War, almost every decade the border will face a large-scale war. The only fortune is the son of the arrogant war and The hoof of the Knights of the Knights Group has never rang at the same time. At the same time, the Holy Empire is a brand new empire. Since the emperor’s desk has one more "The Wealth of Nations" that was cast aside by the orthodox, the two emperors are committed to Introducing business into a form of national honour, and no longer being regarded as an immoral act by the Holy See theologians, especially after the appointment of Jupiter the Great, he will not hesitate to promote the legitimate profit of the merchant to the same level as the civilian knight on the battlefield. The morality is high, so this empire soil has taken the lead in the emergence of a variety of upstart business aristocrats such as bankers, and more and more military upstart families, these two groups are the loyal fans of the emperor, the most willing to pay The proponents of money and force, like the sissy Helen, the barbarian Greenspan, are typical examples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 50 years of keen reform and rapid development, the silent sacred empire has finally emerged as a rich and powerful empire with two powerful countries at the same time. But Jupiter, who gradually moved from youth to middle age, kept a low-key restraint that the outside world could not imagine on the mainland stage. He was neither a nameless spade, a white rose, a widower who was so scared by the Queen of the Card, or At the round table, the old Titans who will smash the cups at other leaders, even if he boarded the apostle’s head card, the epic mainland is still the one who cuts off a large number of heads of father and brother and rides the horse himself. Wonderful Empress, very few people will take the emperor of the Holy Empire as a banquet theme, which is too boring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a path at the junction of the Marceau County and the Imperial City, a small and medium-sized carriage is parked by the road, not luxurious, and the emblem on the carriage symbolizes the empire. Not well known. But the exquisite Brandenburg silver curtains and the special Saddle saddle on the horseback show that the owner has a good taste. A well-dressed old man looks anxiously in the middle of the road, and his carriage has met. Big trouble, the two horses seem to be overworked, foaming at the mouth, and falling to the ground. The derelict old man tried to find the help of a good gentleman, but the number of teams passing by in the middle did not stop. There were too many speculators who needed to rush to Jupiter to seize wealth and title, a pause. Perhaps it is a precious opportunity to slip away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the little carriage with the gold balance of the quirky coat of arms slowly stopped and walked out of a young man dressed in a plain robes. He calmly asked: “Need help?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler who looked at the eye and did not have a special identity, said with a smile: "Thank you for your kindness, but I don't think you can help this. Because of my negligence, both horses are tired. And we need to get to Jupiter before dusk."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest thought for a moment and smiled: "If you don't mind my car is crowded, and I am willing to believe in a monk, you can take my carriage, and I will let my groom take care of your carriage and wait until the horse is restored to the city of Jupiter."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler is in a difficult situation. Although he is not a big family who is good at the upper-level calculations, he has the minimum vigilance of living for more than 60 years, in their simple and simple city, or More or less heard of the fascinating absurdity of the Mazuo nobles There are endless terrible traps in the emperor. There are too many small aristocrats who want to go to Jupiter City for gold and long-sighted people to be deceived. This is not without precedent in his city. Not long ago, there was a young baron in the imperial capital. The beautiful woman who claimed to be the countess deceived more than 100,000 Caesar gold coins, and almost had to rely on begging to return to the territory. But his two masters really need to get to the glorious city right away, otherwise he will not be so risky to drive the horses. Fortunately, the opposite monk understood the situation of the old butler and sincerely whispered: "That will lend my horses to you first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price of the horses of the two carriages Quite, in this way, there is no profitable scam, but is the priest of the Maso County so good at all without paying the price? The old housekeeper was touched by some time, and the old man without aristocratic status was not too embarrassed to accept the goodwill immediately. He originally wanted to come up with some gold coins to give back and forth, but the young man’s monk’s identity, the old housekeeper is not sure if this will Injury the heart of a devout priest. The elegant lady who walked down the carriage solved the housekeeper's housekeeper. She was not beautiful, but her temperament was quiet and her clothes were beautiful. The white chest was hung with a genuine Lavanu sapphire necklace. This kind of price is rare but rare. The sapphire lady has been praised by the court poet. She went to the young monk. After the ceremony, she smiled and said: "Respected monk, my daughter and I are willing to take your carriage to Jupiter, Mena, Richelieu. The family will remember your favor."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monks who had studied the empire complex aristocratic pedigree just nodded and did not show too much enthusiasm because it would scare To the lady and the ladies. The family's last words have a teaching that outsiders regard as contempt but is highly respected by him: the moment when the woman is cheated to the bed to take off the last piece of clothing, don't relax, that is the farthest moment from success, my descendants, you still need to be cautious. Be cautious. The aristocratic lady from the northern province of Richelieu went back and shouted the carriage of the same temperament than the daughter of the appearance. The priest recalled, Mena? It seems to be an unknown local small family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be seen that the lady and the lady who accepted the good intentions and got on the risk with a certain risk were not completely open minded, even though the old butler had become the groom of the new carriage, and the blond teenager who was walking slightly remained in place to take care of Mei. Na's family carriage. Only when the two well-trained ladies saw the "White Robe Master" who closed their eyes in the compartment, they immediately sighed, and the shy young lady looked awkward because there were two in her compartment. Dreaming of a crystal wand that she can hold on her own day, she is not sure if their level is singer or higher, but she is definitely a high-grade crystal rod she has never seen in Richelieu Province. She is the most respected. The magic teacher, an old professor of the official magic union of the province of Richelieu, has a singer-level staff. It is the careful education of the old professor and his hard work that enabled her to break through the examination and enter the Imperial Tulip. The cradle of the magician, St. Carroll College, is a great college named after one of the three magic gods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a heated conversation, the priest’s well-known girl named Tillis is a trainee magician who went to the St. Carlos School of Magic to participate in the journal. Today It was the last day, so I had to be anxious, because the rigorous and stereotyped St. Carroll College never accepted students who were late for the report, even if you were the Prince of Schopenhauer. For this reason, even Jupiter had to write it himself. An apology letter begged the dean to make an exception, but the old courtyard that refused the gold clover honour was ignored because of the disagreement with the imperial prime minister. Therefore, the imperial empire is precisely the improper handling of this letter, which led to the near Ten years of Emperor's Majesty's support for the Arcane and the unusually cold of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest smiled and said: "Being able to enter St. Carol is the first threshold in the field of magic. It is not easy. I rarely see the moss. Miss Liz is willing to spend her time on magic books instead of makeup."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, he wanted to say that a lady who does not wear makeup is the most touching. The ladies, but found that the noble lady of the Mena family seemed to have painted a little makeup, and had to sneak this sentence back to her stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Liss, who has a pair of charming little dimples, obviously likes this kind of compliment, but her greater interest is still magical, her eyes are always obsessed with On the magic wand in the corner of the carriage, for the magician or the person who is walking on the road to become a magician, there must be one or several magic wands in his life. This is equivalent to the knight’s rifle and the swordsman’s sword. . The magic wand and the magician level are strictly matched in the forward direction. The lower level magician is not allowed to carry the middle and high level staff. For the magician, the staff is a sacred item that needs to be feared and controlled, instead of showing off the luxury goods. The discovery of non-compliance is immediately deprived of badges and qualifications. This is consistently followed by the dean of St. Carroll, who is also the president of the Imperial Magic Guild, and has always been followed by the great aristocrats. Entertainment in the small circle is ignored by "accidental" only if it does not cause public opinion. But in the reverse direction, there is no demanding. Like the old dean who only wears the highest-order black orchid medal, he only has one intermediate white crystal magic wand for a lifetime. For an old man whose magical rumors and status can be as good as the Teutonic priests, there is no need to rely on an epic magic wand to prove anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
