Without me, how can you easily solve the problem of the little idiot." Did not successfully explore the bottom of Elizabeth screaming, with a slender finger, a serious calculation of the number of copper plates Augustine should give her, give the answer, "two points six bourbon silver coins, 260 copper plates, one can not be less! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you say? I can't understand it. I am just an official orthodox magician who just got a 6th certificate in the city of Judit, naturally." I don’t know what the two metals and elements have changed.” Augustine, who was poorer than any big man in the empire, had a hard time, and then held down Miss Elizabeth’s head to stop her from kicking and kicking, and ruled her out. Beyond the scope of safety, "remember it. I suddenly thought that someone said that the bottom of the bunker has abundant nuclear resources. It is a spring-like landlord's pulse. It must be a very valuable place. I feel that it is easy to send a hand to a certain two or three silver coins. It’s too unwise for me to make a big shot. I have to think about it again.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The lovely Augustine Master, I told you that Lao Pingping was sent. Coffin, do you think we can ignore the boring topic of the two multi-wave silver coins?" Elizabeth immediately stopped attacking Augustine, wearing her princess dress, her hands on the chest, holding a pair of innocent beautiful nephews, poor hope Look at the miser who hit her weakness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin shrugged indifferently and walked along the spiral passage to the grounds of the Possian Castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth behind him hates tooth itch, but dare not "naughty", in front of this engraved guy to explore down, each down one Layer, she can feel the nuclear energy springs bring a lot of energy fluctuations, nuclear is the fulcrum of all magic and arcane, without it, even with the most powerful lever, can not look down on the magic ball, this is also Augustine has a large amount of heretical knowledge reserves but is the biggest reason for the 6th level magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for whether this aristocratic young master deliberately hides his strength, Elizabeth can’t judge it now. In any case, being able to control that spring alone, for her, and for the little black pet who fell into a hibernation because of the sixth sacred evolution, is an opportunity that can be met, and may accelerate her shoulders. Xiao Bai's "God Drop", think of this, the young version of Queen Elizabeth is in a good mood, and began to bounce, very happy to meet her future neighbors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking out of the Poetry Castle, Augustine saw a gorgeous carriage, engraved with a bright aster flower that once appeared to be never faded in the city of Augsburg. A man with a silver hair wearing a tuxedo got off the bus and lifted a woman in a wheelchair. The old man in the housekeeper combed the meticulous hair, respectfully stood on the side of the wheelchair, and looked at the youth step by step. The eyes of the deep crow's feet were slightly wrinkled by the scythe, and the old man has not been so open for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is the steward of the Luo Tong Chaid family and has served three homeowners. He witnessed Grandpa Augustin cutting the great heresy on the battlefield. The head, who personally will fight with Rotong Childe for more than two hundred years, the Dehter family is sent to hell. Lao Yuping also saw the Duke of Poet in Augers City win the heart of the Duchess and became one of the most enviable couples in the Empire. And 20 years ago, the old man was the one who liked to let the young Augustine ride on his neck. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler is quite straight, without a trace of slack, as if it was the first day to become a middle-aged man of Rotong Chaid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman has a long black hair that almost spreads on the ground, in the most striking contrast with the old man, she is in a wheelchair, staring at Augustine, holding one in her hand This book has almost only the cover of the book, and a folded paper plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin walked next to the wheelchair, kneeling down, holding her cold little hands that were slightly reddened by the cold, and put it on the lips. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Elizabeth groaned in a weird manner, and then climbed into the luxury carriage, which was only a shocking addition to the two boxes that were beautifully made in Baroque classical style. Coffins, dense characters and spells, centered is an ancient Latin: I am sleeping here, the saints sleep with me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was too lazy to pay attention to the boring reunion of a couple, the guy at the head is the thing she is most interested in. She is sitting on the coffin, also as an enemy of mankind, and is still regarded as the culmination of the high value of the experimental values ​​by the two great churches of Byzantine and Vatican, and Elizabeth will no longer be able to easily disturb a prince. She must also maintain a moderate respect and friendliness when she is a long-lived species. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Working hard, Lao Pingping." Augustine looked up and thanked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young Master, this is the duty of Lao Pingping." Lao Yuping smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin stood up and looked at the old butler, who was centered on Rothschild, and couldn’t speak. A large family carrying too many heavy glory and glory suddenly died. Many of the forces surrounding Luo Tongchaid began to swell out. The branches that used to climb the huge aster flowers were quietly retracted. It is impossible to see the visitor’s residence, only the old man in front of him. Augustine can fully imagine that Lao Pingping alone wipes the loneliness of the 13 huge portrait oil paintings every day. The old man will certainly guard the Duke of Luotong Child in the eastern part of the Empire. Until the day he walked away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin and the butler, the old man, carried the coffin, and the nephew Ares pushed the wheelchair, and Miss Elizabeth had to pick up the box that was seriously inconsistent with her delicate body. The group took 4 floors to the underground castle of Shi's brother, and the coffin loaded with a prince-level leech was temporarily placed in the study of Augustine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the blood pressure of Augustine, no one dares to move around, so no one has found this strange team. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Young Master, you have finally grown up." Lao Yuping stood in the study and looked at the rows of thick pens on the simple bookshelf. To the young master who suddenly jumped from the baby to the younger and suddenly matured into an adult, the old butler couldn’t help but feel a little worried. "Lao Pingping can’t wait around the young master, I hope you don't mind." /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aris pushes a wheelchair with Pandora, the daughter of Prince Odes to the square at the bottom of Swan Lake, and Elizabeth climbs over the coffin to study non-stop I want to find out how a Marquis leech might be promoted to the prince of the blood world power pyramid in just a hundred years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lao Pingping, I am sorry." Augustine was stunned and his eyes were red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth looked up and looked a little at the human allies who didn’t like to express their feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knows what he is talking about. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old butler shook his head and smiled with uneasiness: "The master and the wife are always proud of the young master, and Luo Tongchaid is also honored with the young master. A little old man has never doubted that he has been shaken. It is a pity that Laojiao should immediately leave for the return to Augsburg, because the Duke’s House is too big and always needs an old guy to take care of it every day. Master, Lao Pingping will back again. I am not moving, I hope that you will be able to walk all the way in the future. If you are tired, stop and rest for a while."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine nodded, cracked his mouth and smiled, and the sun was shining, as if it was just a little clean before the young family of Luotong Chaid's family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A box is the master who told me to hand it to you at the time, and the other box contains some precious items that the lady collected for you." Lao Yuping paused for a moment and sighed: "I really hope that I can live for decades. I can wipe the portraits of the young masters every day and tell the children of Luo Tong Caier, this is the greatest devout of the empire, Master Augustine. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin blinked and smiled: "The old man is flat, can't carry me, you can continue to carry my child."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lao Ping smiled and nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single the old butler alone to the poetry brother castle, waiting for the old man to sit on the carriage driving position, Augustin whispered: "The enemy does not die one day, the aster flower will never die. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lao Ping flat looked down at the chest of the aster flower badge, heard the 12th Duke of Luotong Child, the Augustor father before the gallows In a word, I finally couldn’t help but leave two lines of old tears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man firmly believes that Master Augustine will not fall one day, and Rotong Childe will never lose her glory! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Elizabeth, who is hiding on the top floor of the Poetry Castle, said: "The excessively strong emotions of human beings are stumbling blocks on the path of biological evolution, or the biggest source?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——————————<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lao Ping left after Black Swan Lake Augustine didn't even open the two boxes, nor did he visit the astrologer Pandora who came from the distant empire. He went straight to the bottom. He and Elizabeth had gone down to the 7th floor and were preparing to step into the 8th. She said that Laopuping brought a coffin, and this stopped the pace. When Augustine re-entered, it took an entire hour on the 8th floor to find the hidden entrance on the 9th floor. Intuition told him that the big shaman dwarf Why did the Aube and Judah parliament elders join hands to create this secret stronghold, and the final answer was to be unveiled before his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping into the ninth floor along the last and longest step, a vast magical energy rushing through the waves, holding a black ball wand Augustine<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I inserted the magic wand into the ground, this was not directly rushed back to the 8th floor. The robe danced. He opened his eyes with difficulty. The 14 huge stone monuments were surrounded by a flawless circle. The stone was engraved with Augustine. He could only vaguely judge that the seven stone tablets were built by the wild "Muse" heresy, because the above are all simple Muse runes, showing a deep black, the other half 7 The block stone was created by the leech family who used to be the king of the underground dynasty. It is red, bright and glaring, like a piece of solidified blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center of the circle is a black hole, and the core is sprayed out in a wonderful state between the gas and the liquid, visible in the naked eye, divided into 14 strands and inhaled 14 stone tablets. Augustine was shocked that the 14 forces were not absorbed into the stone in a quantitatively equal position, but in the first time they rushed out of the pulse to form 14 kinds of energy, so the strong thing is this. There is no such thing as an amazing choice in any official orthodox book in the world. Just like an operator, it is usually dissected at the physical level, but now there is a terrorist role that can be manipulated on the soul level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Augustine, who was led by witch Artemis to the first magical threshold, seems to have touched the tipping point of the next threshold, perhaps lifting his foot By taking this step, he will be able to be extremely powerful and completely break the imprisonment of his own nuclear capacity. But in the face of the huge temptation, Augustine still chose to stay in place, insisted for an entire hour, are trying to crack the secrets of the 14 stone tablets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before cracking, he will never go one step ahead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Luck is always a little more courage than ordinary people. Do you need your sister to tell you about their dark history?" Little girl Elizabeth didn't know when to sit On the ladder behind Augustine, holding the gang with both hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine did not respond to Queen Elizabeth’s olive branch. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth reveals the astounding in her eyes, saying to herself: "This is a magical array that a madman had studied in a hundred and fifty years. The 14 stone tablets and spring eyes that you see with the naked eye together constitute the first magical array. Do you know what the red stone tablet you are facing is raw? Blood, and it is all the blood of the high-ranking priests of the Holy See. This is called holiness. It is said that the Judah parliament even used the top secret forces and captured a number of poor bishops, including the two red archbishops of the Apostolic Church. The most important thing is that you are a member of the Vatican The Son's is also drained from the blood, which is why the two great dark giants of the Ministry of the Holy Spirit will come in person. The second Great Magical Array is a large-scale necromancer called "sacrificial" on our continent. You only have to In the first few steps, a three-dimensional defense system guarded by 49 shaman souls will appear on the ground, and your weak souls will be swallowed up in front of them in a few seconds. The third, then It is in accordance with the cumbersome superimposed magic array set by the 12 Zodiac Palace. Well, I will completely recover the sentence from the Auberge at this moment. You are the childish smash of the wild boar, the dwarf shaman, you are indeed the most crazy wise man in our continent, the 12th house, What a huge project, and a little carelessness in the process, is equivalent to detonating the entire gunpowder barrel. You are worthy of being a big genius just after the 'Duke of the Black Majia Rams.' Finally, Augustine, it is in front of you. Known as the left eye of God."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
