			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Uploaded at 3:30 in the morning, completed the task of August 2nd.)<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lancome Known as the Todd family's small canary, the castle is as small and exquisite as the Ascott Manor, hidden in the woods, very lining, but it has two extremely uncoordinated ugly "tumors" under the gentle and quiet mask. One of the bloody Mississippi Arenas is well known to the upper class of the Maso County, and one of the suites is extremely concealed. It is an interesting place to be built by the Earl of Heber in the same estate as Mississippi. The fun of Mississippi is that It can stimulate the nerves of the rich and paralyzed, and the private suite of the Viscountian is said to make any Yang-痿 aristocrats heroic, more effective than eating the Martini bullwhip, so far only the confidant Louis and A few Marceau young nobles were able to visit. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, now Augustine took cosmo two hidden female consuls and three undead to the outside of the suite, the sweaty Lancome Castle second housekeeper Outside the door, at first I saw Luis, who was at the forefront, happy, but just waited for his relief, he immediately turned to a despair, because he saw the culprits that forced him to risk his life to disturb the Viscount, Yaxing. The culprit, the terrible Loli with the two "big witches", the deputy butler witnessed the cruelty of the red robe devil harvesting life, not only destroying the flesh, but even the soul must be sucked and drained by a strange way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Memy, you can go to Mississippi to handle the business, hand it over to me." Louis paled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deputy steward fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no substantive meaning when he stays here, because without the key, unless he breaks through the thick and powerful door that sounds surprisingly powerful, he just knocks Broken his fingers, the young lord in the room could not hear his shouting. The most troublesome thing was that the Viscount adults solemnly declared that no one could interrupt his "noble game". The last housekeeper paid the price of life to verify the owner. The warning was terrible. The old butler who had worked hard for the Todd family for a lifetime was thrown into Mississippi. The adult mammoth caught by the Muse mainland was swallowed and burned. No bones left, just spit out some digestible. Silver hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis trembled and took out a beautiful key, hesitated, or inserted, opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room is large, so the bed is large, beyond the common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baroque court style, magnificent, the softest wool carpet, the most dense crystal chandelier, the most luxurious seats, the most lavish gold-plated vases, of course, the most eye-catching is the most luxurious goose down bed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the big bed, it’s also astounding to Augustine. The big bed is called a white round--elastic and infinitely ambiguous style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six or seven nudes, intertwined in a wonderfully esoteric posture, almost made Augustine think it was the physical version of the Mobius ring. Despite the dazzling, these outsiders can still see that the protagonist is a young man lying in the middle of the center, and the mature-woman who is upside down on his head, the other four fresh and white bodies are surrounded by two petals. The protagonist constitutes a surrealistic oil painting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Quentin overslept and cursed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Elizabeth sees the treasure and rushes over, picks up a leather whip that has been abandoned on the ground, she jumps to a chair , keep your eyes open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should have been the ugly face of today’s actor, and it’s ugly to hide the bonfire, and finally close your eyes and look painful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His soul hates the play of Viscount Heber on his body, but his body quickly adapts to the immoral bed movement and sinks into it. Among them, more and more enjoy the taboo pleasure brought by the skilled masters, as long as Augustine looks around for a week, you can find the nude paintings of the lady's ladies hanging on the wall, each woman poses a wave of teasing, they 胴Every detail of the body is lifelike. They may be the elegant wife of an aristocratic adult in the county of Maso. It may be a famous Marceau who may be famous in the Imperial Salon. It may also be famous in the next county. The female knights, and even the nuns in the nearby counties who are expected to receive the honorary title of the Holy See, have different identities, different looks and different temperament. The only similarity is that they all surrendered under the sweet offensive of Viscount Heber, and they fell. Or elegant or gorgeous or serious clothes, take off the mask, and be the lover of the 3rd pick of the Lion King. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s a nobleman who knows how to enjoy the sound of dogs and horses. If you can conquer a woman, you can count as a meritorious service. This Viscount has already won several Iron Oak medals. Such talents should be thrown into an enemy country like Titan to be a spy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustine, an eye-opener, admired in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undead dragon knight "Little Lily" and the red robe were placed at the door, and Louis re-locked the door, but he was not willing or unwilling Out loud, because his political mind, which became more and more useful after entering the Todd family, told him that the worst ending in this suite today is that Viscount Heber has paid an unimaginable gold coin and then found some scapegoats. On the top, Louis hopes that the best of these lambs is them, and that the singer is his biggest rival, Mrs. Fiona. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing that is alert from happiness is the young woman who is not young, but what is unexpected is that she did not remind me that she is going to reach the peak of desire.柏柏爵, but intentionally or unintentionally throwing a wink to the Augustine who does not look like a member of the sacrament, more like a young nobleman. Apparently, she used this wild boar as a provocate of the Ascott Manor as a Heber. Viscount's close friend, in addition to today's feast, she did not serve the two male aristocrats at the same time. On the contrary, at that time, she was the most feminine and most technical "Fiona time", and tasted her taste. Ascott's guests will not deny that Mrs. Fiona was the most delicious dessert under the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Augustin smiled and reached out and gestured to continue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiona really continued to work hard, and the Viscount Heber was once again the peak of happiness, and she was also under the service of the Viscount and several of her young women. Suddenly raised his head, his body twitched, his chest was full of glimpses of the spring, and the waves were turbulent, and the young Elizabeth, who had always been interested in it, was annoyed, jumped out of bed, raised her whip, and slammed on the heap of meat, and the sound was crisp. However, there was a lot of helplessness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louis feels like riding a dragon today, suddenly ups and downs, and now the heart finally slows down and begins to hold a good attitude of watching the show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, as long as the omnipotent Master Heber does not fall, the unclean Mississippi will be able to continue even if he is stunned. Be his honorary steward. For the first time, Louis, who had calmed down, had plenty of time to observe the Knights of the Templars who were close at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Heber first saw Augustine and then frowned slightly, pushing away those women whose status was not low, leaving Fiona The lady dressed him and calmly smiled: "Is it interested?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
