			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nexel Palace, in the House of Nobles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the storm, the thunder roared, the lightning glare, the end of the scene, and the semi-circular hall has gathered all in Renttat A member of the House of Lords, a white hair set, a black coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the power of unnatural lightning is great, the strongest under the Golden Knight will not dare to fly in the thunder of lightning, I am afraid that there will be rare in the House of Noble. All the members at first sight arrived at Qi Jingxiang, and it was only an hour before the King of Fertes and the Prince Patrick were called. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, those aristocrats who are unable to come are also aware of the passing of things through their remote contacts in the mouth of their spokespersons and allies in Rentat, The opinion was conveyed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, they are more than ever thanks to the "Allinge Telegraph and Telegraph Company". The "wireline telephones" they promoted are complicated due to the complexity of infrastructure construction. At a loss, it is limited to between the Rantat and the capitals of several other counties, with an installed capacity of less than 500, but in this weather, for nobles who cannot arrange and use expensive transmission arrays, It is a rare channel for communication, so that many nobles have tasted the sweetness and decided to promote it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can the Lord’s Highness be called by the Lord?" The Earl of Sea Pine took a hot bath in the lounge of the House of Lords and changed his clothes and hair sets. This was rid of the state of shock and inability to think, wearing white paper flowers on the chest, sitting on the first row of seats, asking the Duke of Pefors James, the Duke of Wolfsburg, Russell and notifying the parliament before rushing in. Viscount Harrison. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the leaders of the Kaiming School except Prince Patrick. At this time, they must communicate well in advance, and they should not be guilty, otherwise it is easy to let them The nobility lost confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James also wore a white hair cover in the House of Noble, covering his bald head, and he said sullenly: "I don't know, I and Russell." When I arrived at Nexus Palace, it was already like this. We checked the prince's body and found no abnormalities. It was indeed a sorrow that caused the weak body collapse. I want to have the guardianship of King Ketonia. No one can assassinate him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Heart of Time" Ketonia is one of the two epic knights of the Holm Kingdom, and the knight of the whole world There are no more than five people who can reach the legendary level three. He and Rudolf II belong to this rank. As for the legendary epic knight, except for the "monsters" such as Prince Dracula, the prince of the abyss, and the first lord of hell. There is only one human being, the head of the Knights Templar, a member of the Cardinal Mission, St. Mermos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that under the guardianship of Ketonia, there will be no assassinations, but James’s face does not see a certain affirmation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Lord Ketonia is the hero of the Twilight War, and is the epic knight who killed the magical empire in the Holm area with the first king, but he is already very When you are old, you are about to reach the end of your life. There are more things to consider and arrange than the average person.” The lord of Russell said with a blank expression. “He is not as quiet as the Winston of the Sorrento family. Watching the situation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Night Walker" Winston is another epic knight in the Kingdom of Holm, currently rotating the guardian of the Kingdom of Holm in several different degrees The colonial state that was won in the space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Harrison sneered: "I don't believe that His Royal Highness will die for the King's sorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp; According to Harrison and Haisong, Patrick stayed in the position of the prince for thirty or forty years. It is inevitable that the king will have the right to conflict. The relationship between the two sides has long been incompatible, especially in their concept. After the difference, it is even more strange. To say that Prince Patrick is too happy to collapse, some of them will believe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Things have grown to this point. We need to get rid of sorrow and do two things. First, secretly ask the wizard of the Magic Council to investigate the truth about the death of the prince. In order to take the initiative in the future, the second is to start the backup plan and fully support David to the throne.” After the Earl of Haisong calmed down, the blue eyes became sharp again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patrick’s body has been bad, and these enlightened aristocrats have long prepared for his death before the king, so after a short period of fear Nothing is wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good." The Duke of James focused on his mouth, his mouth kept opening and closing, and he conveyed the results of the negotiations to other enlightened aristocrats. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, the aristocratic House Speaker, wearing a black coat and a white hair set, "The King's Griffin" Rex came in, his A dark-haired man with a smile and a gentle smile, the silver-gray eyes clearly told everyone that he was a member of the Hoffenberg family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gordon!" Earl of Pines and other enlightened aristocrats stared at them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James is as ugly as it is to drip: "He did not claim to serve the Lord for life, and he withdrew from the Knights of the Sword of Truth and went to the Holy City of Reims. Joined the Knights Templar?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Knight of the Eighth Heaven, less than 50 years old, the sword of tearing..." Duke Russell and Viscount Harrison The expression is solemnly self-talking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole hall, suddenly picked up, other nobles, regardless of the enlightened faction, or conservatives, could not help but talk to each other, this Gordon is Hoffenberg The genius and heterogeneity of the family, who became a knight at the age of thirty-five, was appointed by the King of Furtis as the deputy head of the Knights of the Sword of Truth, but he was a devout believer in four. At the age of ten, he went to the holy city of Reims and joined the Knights Templar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He’s relationship with King Feltis is far from being much different from David’s, but the rank of the Knight is enough to make his inheritance The number is soaring, almost the same as David, and although Hoffenberg is not prosperous, most people are either alienated from the blood, not knights, difficult to compete with the two, or already Going into the path of magic, automatically gave up the qualifications. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James and others initially thought that Rex would be inclined to his nephew, Alex, who had just inspired the blood of the sword of truth, when it was the strength of the Cavaliers. Or the distance between the blood and the blood, can make David continue to succeed without suspense, who knows that Gordon actually ran back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of the front raft hits crisply, and the hall of the noble house was quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex painted a cross on his chest, with a sad face: "Our great King Fertis and His esteemed Crown Prince Patrick an hour ago After the Lord’s call, let us mourn for them and bless them to receive the Lord’s care in the mountains of heaven.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James and others all stood up and painted the cross, While lowering my mind, the atmosphere is quiet and sad. Five minutes later, the Speaker of the House of Lords, Rex, gestured to everyone to sit down and look strong: "Because of the first heir to the kingdom, His Royal Highness Crown Prince Patrick is also the Lord." Called, and did not leave a child, so according to the Code, a Crown Prince will be elected by our House of Lords, and the criteria for selection will be based on inheritance and will receive the blessing of the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The so-called blessing of the Lord is that the cardinal has come to preside over the successor ceremony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex did not let the nobles speak, but instead pointed to Gordon Road next to him: "The Holm royal family was hit by such a blow. On the occasion of the storm, Count Gordon decided to take the family as the weight and withdraw from the Knights Templar. He returned through the transfer of the church. He is a Knight of the Eighth Heaven, a good old man, and a pure blood of truth. I propose that He succeeded to the throne and invited all of you to vote."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait a minute." James stood up and his voice was loud. "In this case, according to the Code, More than two-thirds of the members must agree, and the nine dukes are not opposed. The elected person can inherit the throne. Rex Speaker, is this the case?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Rex looked at James gloomyly: "Yes, it’s not right. When the other selected people can’t get more than one-fifth of the votes, the rest of them don’t need to meet this condition, and in an emergency, they get More than half of the votes can directly obtain inheritance rights, I believe now It is an emergency, and the throne cannot be vacant for a long time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it an emergency, not that you have the final say, you need everyone to vote. Now, I choose David. Earl, his kinship is closer to His Majesty the King. According to the succession order, he is far ahead of Count Gordon, and he is a great knight who has already ignited the blood." James did not speak on the stage, but directly in the original Looking around at other nobles, "I don't think there is a member who will oppose the inheritance order. Whoever demonstrates first, then his son, when his grandson inherits the title, can other people in the family be able to invoke other higher-powered candidates? In this case, grab the title?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
