			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a spacious laboratory, the alchemy platform and all kinds of magic items that should have disappeared, but there is no empty feeling. On the walls, on the floor, on the ceiling, all are highlighted or silver or black magic patterns, they sway the water-like light, and they are connected to each other into a three-dimensional model. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, they stretched out, intertwined with layers of illusory big nets, and integrated with the complex magical arrays arranged in the middle of the lab, forming a far-reaching Mysterious picture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Array?" Heidi looked at the small lab with amazement. The teacher has been busy for a few months, and mystery is mystery. Magic array? And it doesn't look too complicated, obviously it's not the kind of time it takes the Arcane Master to spend a few months. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She originally thought that the teacher was setting up a new experimental device, such as a better and stronger particle collider, but the facts made her difficult to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick took a moment to identify the general purpose of this magic array: "Time and space magic array? The door to the outside world?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes him and Heidi and others even more surprised and confused than before. After seeing that it is not an experimental device, they can still guess that this magic array has a special purpose and can complete a special microscopic Field experiments help arcaneists find the mysteries of electrons and other microscopic particles, but who knows, is actually the type of transmission of the door of the alien world! What is the use of this atomic research? Can it be transferred to the inside of the atom? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no concern for their ignorance and curiosity, and they walked into the lab without hesitation. Standing in the middle of the magic circle, then turned to laugh at Katrina, Sprint, Annick and Heidi: "What is the specific use, I will know if I have tried it."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, you are too bad, my curiosity will explode!" Heidi's expression exaggerated, and at the same time, the small step ran into the lab, stood next to the teacher, Sprint and others Although full of doubts, I dare not fall behind. For fear of being robbed by others. . Follow her into the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heidi, wait a minute and tell me all the things I see and feel!" Lei Yi Li Ya enviously raised her voice, she just Raise your hand and take a slow shot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazar, Rock and Jerome stood by and smiled at their actions. Although I am very curious. But always feel that I am a friend of Lucien. Counting Heidi and other "uncles", it is not good to compete with them even if their arcane level and magic level have been caught up by Annick and others, but the psychological feeling is difficult to change. Unless they can become legendary magicians or arcans in just a decade or so like Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, Lucien hit a ring in his right hand, and all the magical patterns around him became bright at the same time. Before the waves of water glare like the midday sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light converges, the center of the magic array seems to have raised a small sun, but the glare is not hot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, this pure light group has been stretched into a "light gate" of two people, and each magic symbol carries a load in the streamer change. Floating, looming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien extended his right hand, as if with a silver glove, he pressed hard on the door of the light, the door suddenly opened, endless light Surging out, drowning Lu Xien, Heidi, Annick and others directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light disappears, Lucien, Katrina and others have lost their sights, and the "Glory Gate" seems to have lost all vitality, lifeless, bleak No light, it seems to consist entirely of pale stones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what Heidi will see..." Chely hands and hands clasped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vertigo of time and space changes did not happen unexpectedly, but the five-ring magicians such as Sprint and Heidi have full experience and have long given I applied a spell to resist this feeling, so the situation quickly improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has not completely rid of vertigo, Heidi can't wait to look ahead, she is so curious! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The front is a transparent "glass", its exterior is dark, this is the deepest and deepest darkness that Heidi has seen, the boundless darkness, the endless end Darkness. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Heidi completely forgot his dizziness, his voice as a nightmare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint, Annick, and Katrina are also lost looking at the darkness and light spots that are not at the end, they faintly guessed something, but it’s hard to be clear Grasp it clearly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien stood in front of their side, raised his right hand, pointing to the deep, dark, white light spots outside, with a slightly sighing tone: "Here is the starry sky."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starry Sky? Universe?" Heidi and others slammed back and quickly looked down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also transparent "glasses" under their feet, with a layer of tiny magic patterns on them, which occasionally emit a little bit of sputum, seemingly dissipating and resisting, Under the "glass", it is no longer a solid earth, a pale blue sky and a blue ocean, but a darkness that is indistinguishable from the surroundings, the deepest and deepest darkness, the boundless darkness, and the white bright light inlays. Among them, the vast and far-reaching <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the four sides are the same deep black, the same vastness, and there is no clear and clear star, so that every human being in it They can't restrain the loneliness and feelings of the heart, and the deep respect is born. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the most beautiful starry sky I have ever seen..." Heidi has also ventured out, but whether it is the starry sky on the plateau or the night view on the ocean, Can not be compared with the scene in front of you, this is an unchanging picture, this is the "starry sea" that most arcane masters yearn for! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katrina, like Heidi, has a fascinating expression on his face. Who says that arcane research is not romantic, this is the greatest romance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint and Annick are more concerned about the meaning of the stars, so they will return to their hearts more quickly after indulging, carefully look around and find yourself waiting for others. In an ordinary laboratory-sized "glass room", it floats in the cosmic starry sky, with a subtle gleam on the surface, and numerous magic patterns appearing faintly, forming a magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the "glass room" is more exaggerated, surrounded by complex mysterious magic arrays, some of which provide gravity, some create air, will change here It is like "ground". Of course, there is still a large part of the magic array that has nothing to do with it. Instead, it cooperates with an alchemy platform and a cyclotron to form a fully functional laboratory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Teacher, is this?" Sprint asked, although he probably guessed the usefulness of the "glass room." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently beheaded and smiled gently: "This is the Cosmic Observatory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Cosmic Observatory?" Heidi and Katrina were awakened by dialogue, just to capture the term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pointed out: "As everyone knows, the universe is full of strange cursing rays and various very dangerous dangers, such as ultra-low temperature, ultra-high temperature, so at least To become a sergeant, dare to enter, and in practice, taking into account the many dangers in the starry sky are unknown, and almost no one of the ** divisions explored here, leaving the vast and vast universe to the legend."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And our previous research shows that many cursed rays are particle flows and electromagnetic radiation of different frequencies, the cursing rays in the universe? We are from various materials over and over again. Looking for, particle collisions over and over again, isn't it just for new discoveries? Cosmic rays are things that we rarely study, maybe we can find new things from them and help us uncover the next layer of the micro world. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, this exploration and research work was done by legendary magicians, but to find the right rays from such a vast universe, and countless Found in the experiment The traces of the difference require a long time and the accumulation of experiments, so the legends have not gained much in this regard."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to this reality, I applied to the Magic Research Council to build a cosmic observatory that can resist cosmic rays and transmit back and forth, so that ordinary arcans can also participate in the study of cosmic rays and the vast expanse of stars, using numbers and times to offset the accumulation of time. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gave a brief explanation of the cause and effect, and then instructed the students how to use the special experimental device in the "Cosmic Observatory", how to pass it "the universe" The ray "guided in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
