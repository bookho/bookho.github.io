			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is getting brighter and brighter, and the darkness is getting stronger and thicker. The figures in the "Atai" are becoming more and more clear, and the ripples like the waves are still covered. The face covered the upper body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the figure suddenly disappeared, and only the white sacred transparent mask on the altar continued to shine on the hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dwarfs of the great elders, Harold, Quinkins and other people who failed to see this change, Tess, Galata, Wells Edith has witnessed the whole process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Haha, haha, their gods have disappeared, and they have been abandoned!" Wells is filled with the joy and ecstasy of "the rest of the robbery." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the altar was lit up, he almost did not faint, but actually there will be a god "falling"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown to the text, I heard that the Count of Vlad was wounded by the Church of Truth and the ancestor of the blood family, "The God of Silver Moon" Legend has it that Wells’s heart is quite convinced of the existence of the gods, so it will scare the soul. Although he is a noble blood servant, there are more noble and powerful blood lords around him, but in the face of the gods, they must still be as weak as ants, let him crush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is a traitor to the dwarfs, the "Steam of the Steam", "The Lord of Life and Death" seems to be the patron saint of the dwarf, falling to Him The hands can be imagined. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edith also laughed insanely: "Look, the gods no longer bless you, our blood race is the noble race to be cared for!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the altar played a role, the pressure and fear in her heart was no less than Wells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders, Harold, Mirna and other dwarves heard the venting voices of the two blood servants, raised their heads in panic, and saw the empty sacrifice station. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Lord?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Does the god of steam abandon us?”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't we do something that God has rejected?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frightening despair, stunned emotions The spread of the surviving dwarves, and finally the devotion and advent of the gods, how has this changed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"High invisibility, he is a magician!" The well-known vampire butler Galata woke up, "That is the transmission array through the space barrier, There are space nodes here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Galata, kill him, I will return to the castle to inform the count!" Tess's face changed again and again, and the back grew black. Bat wings, turned without hesitation and fled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spatial node is the gate of the "castle" of the alien space. In order to prevent the invasion or sneak of foreign enemies, all nodes must be in the hands of the party, otherwise Maybe one day the truth god, the magic parliament will send a few strong people to sneak in, and take the entire space of the alienation, and in some different degrees of space, several forces repeatedly saw the battle, the competition is the space node. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night plateau, the proven space nodes are occupied by powerful vampires, at this time, facing the newly emerging nodes, Tess, Gala The two orthodox blood families of the tower are naturally attached to the situation and must be controlled as soon as possible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, because it is not clear what the level of the magician entering through the space node is, the careless Tess does not dare to take risks, decided to let Galata temporarily Hold on, go back to the castle and ask the count to shoot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although long-term tortured by the gods, often fell asleep, but the Count of Vlad is also a high-ranking vampire, the most powerful blood race nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, the strength of vampires is closely related to the title they are awarded by the Blood Presbyterian Church. For example, the Baron represents the official knight or Dark Master level, and the Viscount means mid-level. The Earl, the Marquis is equivalent to the high-order, the Duke is equal to the Archmage, the Golden Knight, and the Prince is a legendary field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many vampires are living in isolation or mixed with human society. Even if the strength grows, they are too lazy to inform the Blood Presbyterian Church. Therefore, it is easy to judge the strength of vampires by virtue of the title. Wrong, as for the tens of thousands of years or even older people in the Rhine, they did not accept the honor of the vampire prince because they liked the name of the Earl. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the short-lived breath, he relied on his keen sense of life to determine that the magician was still on the altar and had not left! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just sent over, and saw a group of dwarfs who were crying and mad like a madman squatting on the ground and chanting their own words, suddenly scared After a jump, I thought that the transmission array that I had arranged had a mistake, was involved in the turbulence of the space, and "crossed" again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien is a conditioned reflex that uses the four-ring magic "high invisibility" and wants to hide and observe the situation before deciding to follow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you still use magic?" It seems that there is no "crossing again." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the invisibility, Lucien gradually recovered his calmness. As a "linguistic expert", he easily distinguishes the language used by the dwarves into the ancient language family. In line with the modern dwarf language, barely able to understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Lord of Steam? What are they doing?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless questions on the road Sean’s heart, he heard the words of Galata before he could clear his mind, “Space node?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Vampire! It’s really the night plateau!” The dwarf vampire with two black bat wings made Lucien affirmed where he was, and then saw another human-like vampire rushing toward himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s eyes are slightly stunned, raising his hand and pointing, absolutely can't let the space node here leak out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to use the night plateau to jump several times, and it is dangerous to be discovered by the prince-level vampire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Rhein did not tell himself which vampires are trustworthy, then "just treat everyone"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold is staring at the empty altar, watching the slowly disappearing white transparent mask, feeling that the dwarf family has been world Abandoned, why did the gods leave after doing nothing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the belief of the dwarf family not enough? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it a cruel vampire who has gained the attention of the gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does our destiny have been completely doomed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teeth bite their lips tightly, the blood penetrates, and the feelings of despair, confusion, and sorrow make him extremely tired, and he wants to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only death is the end of all suffering! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only death can bring eternal peace! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such emotions are filled with the hearts of every dwarf, even the great elder Augustus is not spared, the last glimpse of his support has disappeared, his The "world" has collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A residual image was swept from their eyes and rushed toward the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Galata..." They were so numb that they only remembered the name and were hard to react to what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the big elder's turbid pupil reflected the brilliant light that erupted before the altar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole person in Galata has become a colorful light group! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red, black, green, countless spots of light are ejected from the light, some quickly become gas, and some emit strong sulfur The taste, some colors change quickly, and it slams into the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than a second, Galata disappeared completely, leaving behind all sorts of "eccentric" things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this magic?" Tess thought with amazement. Her bat wings have not yet started to fantle, Galata was killed? And "decomposed" into a lot of substances? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it a legendary magician? Legend has it that the “elementalization” of “Elemental Dominator” Hathaway has a similar description! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great fears come to her mind and must escape! Run away! Slow down and die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teng’s black fog rises, and countless tiny bats fly out from inside and flee in all directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wells and Edith have not even reacted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Galata became a variety of "singular" things, Harold's heart suddenly emerged with extreme joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord has not abandoned us! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The God of Steam is still guarding us! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two lines of tears rushed out again. At this time, he felt a warm and soft force through his body, just like his parents’ touch in childhood. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this the power of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the daytime, he heard it The screams, the subconscious look back, I saw that the wicked supervisor Wells was carrying a strong white smoke, a piece of rotten flesh and blood continued to sway, the whole person trembled, and did not even have the strength to escape. Soon, with a bang, Wells dissipated the skeleton and fell to the ground, as did the maid, Edith, around him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the entrance of the passage, a small black bat fell to the ground, the body tumbling, dissipating, and then shrouded in faint sacred light. It melted quickly and disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't die! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later, an invisible female surname screams resounding near the passage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tess is dead? Is Galata dead?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just like everyone’s nightmare Are the two "horror" vampires dead like this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is this the power of God?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same question, different meanings, surviving The dwarves can't believe it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quinkins is very close to the altar, and Galata’s “drop” is in front of him, and he subconsciously picks up one of the metals. Debris-like things and small pieces of black solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes suddenly stunned, his hands could not help but tremble, his expression was very excited: "This is iron, this is coal, it is really steam." God!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing away the things in his hands, Quinkins stretched his hands, kneeling on the ground, praying loudly:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great life and death dominate, you love us, just as you hold the supreme authority."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In your glory Under the light, we will be free from all sufferings and evils."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elders, Harold, Mirna and other dwarves, looked at the altar and turned their heads I looked at the bat body, white bones, and carrion left in the entrance of the passage. I thought of the horror of Tess’s magic. I thought that she would be purified without any resistance, and there was no doubt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The eyes of the world, can not see the gods, ordinary brushes, difficult to depict the ultimate, the real master, never sacred before the people!" Suddenly, the elders thought The reason for "interpreting" the emptiness of the altar was more and more exciting, loudly announced, and then prayed piously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You dominate everything, control the boundaries between life and death, the king of kings, the god of God."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the dwarves, after hearing the "interpretation" of the elders, followed him with enthusiasm and eagerness to worship the altar and watched Lucien glimpse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our glory, our lives, our authority, belong to you, the great god of steam!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
