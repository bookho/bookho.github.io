			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The King of Angels" Mecan Tron has just arrived, but he has solemnly started his right hand as prepared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eight-pair pair of pure rays of angel wings behind him blooms with holy glory, and the sacred seven-story heaven mountain emerges like nothing, one place The Holy Spirit and an angel are singing and praising, and the beautiful and ethereal voices are stirred up by layers of layers, gathering together into a condescending, indifferent and fair trial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different from other priests and sacred angels who display the "light of judgment", and it is different from the previous "light of judgment" by his use of the "class of heaven". Canteron’s chest is still floating with a small white balance of black and white. It seems that there is a lot of sin in the soul under the “light of judgment”. It should be ascended to heaven, or into hell, or permanently destroyed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This balance, in addition to the meaning of "trial", is also accompanied by a strong order, and the vast chaotic stars in the vicinity become well-ordered, no longer derailed and The inexplicable collision happened like a real starry sky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Order of the Balance", "King of the Angels" Mecan Tron, in addition to the "Guardian of God", belongs to his own other legendary deity, the holy Hertz The empire's artifact "order balance" is made with it as the blueprint - the royal family of the sacred Helz empire has a shallow relationship with the god of truth, and it is the blood of the blazing angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black and white balance swayed from side to side, making a sly low-pitched voice, corresponding to the ruling of Mecanthon’s solemnity, as if it was pronounced Lucian and Natasha is guilty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sound of this sound, the "light of judgment" that is so pure that it can't hold a trace of enthusiasm is projected from the seven heavens. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness disappears, everything is inconsistent with order, and it is not sacred. The things that cannot be allowed in the truth are instantly disintegrated. This is the ruling of death and life. This is the judgment of the last days! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw the situation, did not dare to scorn, spit out the sound of sizzling in the throat: "steep turn"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mirror engraved with countless complex patterns highlights the void in front of him and Natasha through these patterns, as if you can see another in the mirror A world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Light of Judgment" hit under the mirror, suddenly caused a deep crack, and then followed the light's reflection theorem to bounce in another direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this, the "steep turn" that can rebound five times of single attack is on the verge of damage, this is the gap between the legendary third-order and the legendary peak! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Lucien is quite happy, according to his own expectations, facing the "king of angels", which is also in the forefront of the legendary peak. Those who have their own "steep turn" can only block once, who knows that there is still a chance to rebound once! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the power conflict between the abyss and the paradise mountain greatly weakening his power, or is he too late to come to full strength?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the "King of Angels" Mecan Tron attacked Lucien and Natasha, Clement, the northern church saint with the same name as the Purified Angel, seized the opportunity to directly The "Holy Cross" shattered the diamond-like asteroids and completely exposed the "space-time slate". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a "king of angels" here, he no longer has to take away the "spatial slate"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a silver-gray sword light cut through the illusory time and space that overlaps around the "space-time slate", flashing in front of him, that breaks everything and destroys everything. The strong meaning made him subconsciously use the "Sacred Blessings", and he did not dare to take the "spatial slate" and was "sword of truth", but it was not a joke! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the silver-gray sword, the illusory gap hidden in the light of the sacred sacred fall on the "Sacred Blessings", it is torn apart, forcing the defensive gram Lehmet had to pay close attention to the delay of the defense and flashed into the distance, almost swallowed by the "space vortex." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he discovered that Lucien had stretched out the "steep turn" and blocked the second "light of judgment" of "The King of Angels". And, his left eye is bright red like a crystal gem, and a red light is emitted, so that the "King of Angels" has to close thirty-six brilliance wings and stop it outside to create opportunities for Natasha to block himself. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the ultimate defense of this single defensive magic is very powerful, it can rebound five times in the same level, and at least once for the stronger than itself, but there are corresponding weaknesses, and the buffering time is very long, even if Lucien wears " The robe of the Great Arcanist can't be used in one or two rounds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Clement’s heart is happy, knowing that Lucien will soon be overwhelmed by the “king of angels” and have enough time and Opportunity to take away the "spatial slate". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he was happy, Natasha, who clenched the small and delicate black shield with his left hand, seemed to know his plan, the silver-gray sword showed, the sword Light is like a shuttle, blocking his front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, don't think that you can fight against me with two third-order epic items. I will tell you that you have a true third-order legend. What a big gap!” Clemente certainly didn’t waste his time on the verbal. This was just a subconscious reaction in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Light of Judgment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he will have a lot of magic, but there is no magic after all The number is complex, varied and varied, and has different applications for different situations. In combination, the “light of trial” works best and has the most powerful ability to adapt to most occasions, so the Holy Spirit priests use the most attacks in battle. The legendary magic is the "light of judgment"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sword-like holiness shines rapidly from the paradise mountain behind Clement, bold and solemn, judging all the sins of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha paused in place, raised the "Shield of Truth", and an imaginary ripple rippled up, making her seem to be in another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light of Judgment" hit the "Shield of Truth", bursting with brilliant brilliance, but unable to penetrate the barrier of time and space, shining to Nata Shake's body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shield of Truth has a small crack on the black sacred surface, and Clement’s “Light of Judgment” obviously has no way to do this. The ultimate defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After blocking the "light of judgment", Natasha waved a silver-grey sword in her hand, and the cold and indifferent swords entwined the illusory cracks to Clay Mente. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jian Guang unrestrainedly fell on 'Lemon', tearing his body, quickly made it torn apart, but Clement did not have a little bit The painful expression, the smile, the shadow is broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, he flashed to the other side, approaching the "space-time slate" and preparing to use his magic to take it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is using the "Shield of Truth" to exert all power, must be like the "Guardian of God" can not move the characteristics of the attack to create close to "time and space The opportunity of the slate, he did not have the time and mood to slowly consume the "Shield of Truth" this tortoise shell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha saw it, her brows were slightly wrinkled, but without any hesitation, she opened the way with the "Sword of Truth" and quickly flew to Clement, trying to He intercepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Light of Judgment!" Clement smiled and stopped the legendary magic again, not surprisingly seeing Natasha stop using the "Shield of Truth "stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, he used Natasha’s real strength far less than himself, using the “Shield of Truth” and unable to move freely, gradually approaching “Time and Space Slate” "If you look at it, you can use it to influence its scope. If it is an ordinary thing, Clement can take it away from far away, but it is a legendary material that can offset a certain degree." The extraordinary power inside, so it must be close to get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Strength is the most important thing, relying on legendary items to display a lot of flaws..." is about to succeed "Time and Space Slate", Clement It is inevitable that a heart will rise in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha was so boring by his teasing-like battle plan, quite strongly felt a sense of powerlessness, indifferent silver and purple eyes The war is getting stronger and stronger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The inconvenience of the shield of truth is so obvious that it is too obvious. I have no strength to stimulate its range of defense effects.······"The Real Legend III When the order uses the "Shield of Truth", the illusory ripples can cover a large range, and then she can create conditions for Lucien to take "space-time slate." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea continues to emerge in Natasha's heart, allowing her to reflect on her own combat skills: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My blood is the sword of truth, my knight faith. Assault, charge, charge, and face all obstacles, this is completely different from the defensive spirit of 'The Truth Shield.·······<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" That being the case, why should I fight with my own shortcomings because of safety? Because of timidity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Sword of Truth is also a legendary third-order!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the Truth Shield can't move if you want to get the most out of it, then don't defend it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A cry of screaming like the horn of the charge rang in Natasha's heart. The contradiction of fighting style caused by holding two "artifacts" gradually attracted her attention. She no longer tried to fuse two pieces as I thought before. The different artifacts of the artifact, but decided to give up one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien said that there is a discard to get it!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The offense is the most Good defense!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The long sword is the best shield!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crystal clear Silver and purple eyes are indifferent but high! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clemente is happy to once again close the "space-time slate", but when he is about to use the magic to take it away, he suddenly feels indifferent but terrifying Pressure, it seems that the hair must be spurred by the numerous but smashing swords. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sword light pressure that even the soul will be divided into pieces! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no determination to die for the "king of angels", at this time naturally self-protection first, the use of legendary magic, like a ray of light Flying next to it, <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, he sensed the sleek, cold, silver-gray sword, and there was nothing else. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, no shield of truth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Light of Judgment!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword of the sword of truth does not have any dodge, directly hitting hard and colliding with the fair but indifferent light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninterrupted, the space trembles, the light of the judgment becomes a shattered ray of light, Natasha also appears, his face is slightly pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she did not hesitate to continue to drive the "Sword of Truth" to launch the "charge" again and again! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Clement is exhausted and can only defend hard in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Insane? How long can you support this? I can kill you if I wait!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver Grey Jianguang keeps flashing, as if filling the entire horizon of Clement, and obscuring the "chaotic starry sky". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side, Lucien was slightly suppressed by the "king of angels", Mecan Tron, but he seemed to have no intention of fighting for a long time, directly reading "The Truth "": "Sacred House!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven-story heavenly mountain projection is almost clear, even the appearance of the six blazing angels can be vaguely seen, from At the highest level, a sacred light hangs down, completely covering the tens of kilometers around Mekantron, giving him the greatest blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the holy voice keeps ringing, the white light illuminates the darkness, the chaotic starry sky becomes like the "Heaven State", and such "Heavenly Kingdom" happens to be Lucien Separated from the "space-time slate", Mecantron and its range of influence become very close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little angelic light shines around the slate of time and space, surrounds it, lifts it up, and flies toward the "Heaven of Heaven." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this progress, the power of "space-time slate" converges, and the "space vortex" that surrounds it disappears rapidly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
