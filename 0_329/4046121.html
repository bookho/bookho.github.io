			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replacing the tuxedo, Lu Xien, who is in a black plain coat, left the hall of the shrine from the side door, because it is said that there are many people who like music in the main entrance waiting for I want to see Mr. Evans playing such a charming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several carriages parked in the dark corner of the side door, and the people in front of the carriage are familiar with the people familiar with Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sudden sentimental and parting in my heart. Lucien gave a sigh of relief and walked toward Victor and Joel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, Lucien, your music and performance are more than I expected, you are my proudest student." Victor took a few steps Embracing Lucien, "Can you look too excited and happy?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor was keenly aware of Lucy’s emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien tried to smile and said: "The last three consecutive piano solo is really exhausting, whether it is the body or the heart." The last half sentence It is explained to John who knows the strength of his quasi-knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor has no doubt: "I can understand that I have not forgotten your sad feelings just now. Have a good rest tonight and celebrate for you tomorrow night. Yes, because if I drag on for a few more days, I will not be in Aalto."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Victor teacher, where are you going?" Lucien is still the first time I heard this. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor gently laughed: "I have received a lot of invitations since the concert ended last year, but that was the crucial time for you to learn the basics. So I have all turned it off. Now Lucien you are already a real musician, I should also travel and perform, huh, or I will become poor. Felice and Lott will follow me. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He can't go with Lucien who has his status. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Lucien asked a subconsciously and saw that Victor and Felice were nodding, so they took the opportunity to say goodbye to everyone. "Actually, I I also intend to do this because I don’t have a rich life experience and I don’t personally see the scenery and culture of different places. I think it’s hard for me to write good works, so I am ready to accept the invitation and make a trip in the whole continent.” Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien You can maintain a normal heart, not arrogant, and try to find ways to break through their limitations, I am very satisfied and very happy." Victor is very happy Said, "I wish you all the best, I am afraid I can only know your news from the newspaper in the next year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish you all the best. "Lu Sien once again embraced Victor with full parting emotions." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he turned and hugged Joel and Eliza: "Uncle Joel, Eliza, I may not be in Aalto. - Ren))."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien's production is twenty-six years in June each year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the falcon grows up, he will leave the lair and fly by himself. Although we are helpless, but this is your life, we will always be proud of you. You never let us down." Joel smiled and patted Lucien's shoulder. "Right, congratulations, our musician Lucian, your performance is really powerful, and music. It also happened to 'hit' me, reminding me of the difficult life of the first time to Aalto."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is laughing and laughing: "Small Evans, you are not coming back again, how sad like a child."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien opened his mouth and didn't know what to answer, so he had to Pretend to be hugged with Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, your music and performance are great, I want to master the piano as soon as possible!" Felice is more excited than everyone else, "The violin is Known as the Queen of Musical Instruments, I think the piano must be the king of musical instruments!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought of his promise, slightly smiled: "I will make my own piano skills With some knowledge, you can not delay the piano learning when you follow Victor's travels on the mainland. Also, if Felice has a good piece of music, I will write for you in Music Review." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, our great musician." Elena answered cheerfully and playfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the bright smile of Felice and Alina, Lucien walked over to John and hugged the good friend who had a lot of himself:" Hope to see you again, John you have become a formal knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John did not hesitate: "Faith determines the will, the will controls the blood, and I already belong My own firm belief, to fight the devil, the devil, guard the homeland, so I believe that I can stimulate the blood!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks very confident, then laughs Road: "But still can't compare with you, Lucien you are already a famous musician in the whole continent, which makes me a little embarrassed, of course, more honor and pride."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and John exchanged a few words, turned around and looked at Joel and Victor for a glance, then took a faint dip and held the left chest to salute everyone:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I hope that you all have a happy life, please allow me to make an advance Do not "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; a bit surprised Lucien is it so seriously, but everyone soon understood to be his first time out travel's sake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ The next day, Lucien spent the day in the busy welcoming visitors, and at night it was a celebration of the dance, lively and joyful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was near the early hours, everyone had left, and the dark night was so quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien waited for the Rhine in the master bedroom, before he made an appointment to come and find himself, telling the location of the Magic Council headquarters and some common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long wait for people to lose patience, Lucien suddenly heard a crisp sound, someone was knocking on the window door of the bedroom balcony! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emergency to stand up, Lucien looked over the past, but Natasha and Camille stood on the balcony. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha in a black dress looks special lady, especially quiet, but she reveals her own surname when she speaks: "Hey, the action is so fast, the road Xien, you really welcome me. Hey, I was busy before, I wanted to send some nobles to leave, and I would like to host the court dance, so I was not able to attend your celebration. Now I would like to congratulate you, but you are my music consultant! "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien opened the window door with a funny smile, let Natasha and Camille come in: "Thank you for your kindness, Your Royal Highness, you should be from Sylvia." Where is Ms. Vija coming back?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How do you know...” Natasha’s purple eyes are round and round, and a deficient guilty look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pointed to the clock of the Golden Cathedral in the distance: "It is said that around ten o'clock, the last guest in the court left. Now it is ten Two points. But my Royal Highness, you can pass by, I am very grateful."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, I came to Jisu District and I always came unconsciously. Sylvia, in fact, I really want to come first." Natasha laughed twice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two people chatted for a while, Natasha suddenly invited: "I am the Countess of Violet, this time every year will go to Katia, the family's direct territory. I lived in the palace for two months. Lucien, I want to invite you to the music consultant to go out tomorrow, go hunting and concert there. Well, Silvia and her father have accepted the invitation."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, maybe I can't go." Lucien told Natasha about her going out to collect the wind, and said goodbye to her friend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha picked a purple eyebrow and said with a little excitement: "It’s really enviable, I want to travel around like this."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eagerly exchanged the characteristics of each country, Natasha asked a little embarrassedly: "Lu Xien, did you hear the melody that you finished? It is like moonlight The beautiful melody, I want to play to Silvia when I am angry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha's oysters are July 30 Oh, in her opinion, Lucien is obviously not going to come back so soon, so ask in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
