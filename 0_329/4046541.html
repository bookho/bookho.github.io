			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City of Aalto, Latava Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to the news that the new Cardinal Bishop Feili Bell conveyed the message, Natasha couldn’t conceal her sadness: “I can’t think of my grandfather’s and my sister’s success. The Lord is called."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I knew that the King of Fertis was old and weak, Prince Patrick was sick and sick, Natasha has done well in recent years. To the bad news, but this kind of thing, and then psychological preparation, can not control the grief of the heart, as the age grows, selfless love protects their blood relatives one by one, one after another, less and less, that is life The most painful experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Patrick still failed to inherit the throne." The Hoffenberg royal family even sighed even more than Natasha's Dakota, but sighed. Nothing to say, but a loving look at Natasha in a white court dress. "Would you like to go to Rentt to inherit the throne of the Holm kingdom?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha thought of Hathaway, thought of Lucien, and then looked at the obviously old father, looked at his purple hair in the purple, and shook his head resolutely: "The Holm Kingdom has many heirs, and you only have me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was taught to take responsibility for the Violet family since I was a child, shouldering the Principality of Vaolirit Responsibility, how can I get out of here?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variot’s grandfather patted Natasha’s shoulder comfortably and looked a little higher than himself. Daughter, slightly smiled: "If I say, I want you to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? Natasha stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feili Bell with a beard and a beard said: "Going is not impossible to return, although the church does not allow the Holm Kingdom and the Vaurit Principality. Merger, but you can take part time, and wait until the future to let the different children inherit, so you can be in the Kingdom of Holm one year, one year in the Principality of Vaolirit, the transmission array is open to you, this is the church for you and you The family has been so devoutly rewarded for so many years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This way, it is easy to control Natasha, and it is easy to guide the nobles to get used to "autonomy" and provoke the king and ordinary nobles. Contradictions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And my body is still very good, at least as a grandfather for twenty years." Grandma Vaoliette joked halfway, "Your mother left her parents." I surnamed Vaolirit, and I watched my father's aging year after year. My brother was sick, and my heart was inevitably blamed. Even if your grandmother passed away, she couldn't catch up with the last side. I was deeply regretful and felt right. The Hoffenberg family owes a lot, so I hope that you can go to the Holm Kingdom when you need the most stable internal situation to make up for your mother's regrets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Natasha was silent, her hands did not know when she clenched her fists, and finally nodded slowly: "Good."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filliebell half-joking half Seriously said: "His Royal Highness, the church knows that the type you like is different from that of ordinary girls, so it helps you to push down the requirement to marry, but the descendants cannot but leave, I believe this is the ardent hope of the Dagong and the nobles of the two countries. At that time, you can consider directly letting angels fall into your body. Giving birth to the holy child, this is the glory of the integrity of the talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde pushed the original Aalto to Lucien, said Lucy With the help of His Royal Highness Princess Natasha, she wanted to use her to comfort her, so the church understood that Natasha’s surname had never changed, and the Grand Duke later knew more or less. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha's thick eyelashes hang down, covering the mood changes, whispering: "I will work hard."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is thinking in her heart: "Is it true that no one surnamed by Lucien? Is it the one who directly borrows him?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Since the determination of his own mind, Lucian has long made various plans, in order to prevent Natasha from being able to withstand the pressure before being chased by himself, in order to give birth to a child, just find a noble marriage I often give her "science" artificial pregnancy, test-tube baby and other knowledge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get Natasha’s answer, Philip Belle and the authentic: "We will not bother you, Princess Highness, and the big announcement, in order to ensure your safety and convenience, It is best to pick a small knight to follow and if their family members are not many, they can also use the transfer array together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he finished, he left to leave. Dagong smiled and said to Natasha: "I just said that I can still be a grandfather for twenty years, but you can't let me wait too long. I hope to see my grandson early. To the future of the Violet family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will work hard." Natasha thought in a hurry, Lucien, your "technique" can never be out problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dagong looks like a smile and looks at Natasha: "I hope that you go to the Holm Kingdom, not only to make up for your mother's regret, but also because of him. There, you don't have to be separated in the two places, so you have to hurry up with the grandson."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Father, what are you talking about? Who is he?" Natasha was embarrassed to pretend to be a stunned look. Why did his father misunderstand this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandfather laughed and said: "Who else? Lucien? Evans. Although you were a couple posing a few years ago, my intuition tells me I, you are not fake now, I am very happy, very happy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, you think too much... Natasha abdomen, but parting soon I couldn't bear to poke his good feelings. At the same time, I decided to use the blood of Lucien to create people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't think that I don't know, who is the target of more than one hour of communication every day in the past few years? Who is the smirk who touched the communication earrings from time to time?" Grand Duke Olymp suddenly felt that her daughter was not as keen as she claimed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha laughed twice: "We are good friends, I have never thought about you, or you can't know."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, okay, pick your little knight, Camille will follow you to Holm." Grand Duke Ou Oli decided to slap Camille. Let her find a chance to "remind" Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha nodded. "Well, when I get to Holm, I will often communicate with my father."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She began to calculate: "Take the Johns and give Lucien a surprise..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Glorious Cathedral, the transmission array opens and the light shines. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This transmission array is used to provide reinforcements during the full attack of the Magic Council. It belongs to the largest category, and can transmit fifty knights at a time, even in the Southern Church. The financial resources can only be arranged in five places, such as the holy city of Lance, Antietre, Aalto, Rentat and Heim, the capital of the northern province of the Holy Hertz. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the milky light, Natasha, Camille, nine knights and their wives, children, parents, etc., more than forty people appeared in it, Joe Er and other ordinary people are dizzy, retching and uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the nine knights, only the third-level knight John brought a complete family such as his parents and brothers. Other knights felt that they could return to Aalto in a year. No need to be so troublesome, just bring a wife and children. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "John, how can you leave your parents where you can't leave? Haven't you grown up yet?" Another great knight, John's friend Finger, joked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When John passed the dizziness, he was busy taking care of Joel, Eliza and Ai Wen, and said with a smile: "Rarely have the opportunity to travel to a foreign country." I should always bring my parents and brothers to see different scenery, and isn’t the Princess’s notice to bring all the family members?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“No, you got it wrong. "Finger looked puzzled at the Natasha Road in front of the dress." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the female officers from Nexel Palace flocked to Natasha to trim the hair, eyebrows, etc., while outside the milky armor. Put on her a cloak embroidered with the Hoffenberg family's coat of arms, which is a magenta coat wrapped in a cloud-like stripe, with a sacred crown in the center, a golden scepter and a blue on the sides of the crown. Long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Dear Crown Prince, please take the Knights to Nexus Palace, then ride along the marked route back to the Glorious Cathedral, where you will be crowned King." The Speaker of the House of Lords, Rex, respectfully bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John and other knights quickly settled their families, guarding neatly behind Natasha, leaving the Glorious Cathedral with her and coming to Nexus Palace in the aristocratic district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Begin!" Rex, who led the way, waved his arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knight raises the horn and blows it hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the horn sound, John and other four knights took the lead and went out. Then, the heroic Natasha stood upright and followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic crystal light of a villa opens, the street lights are all lit up, one after another, just like the stars in the sky are welcoming the new king. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is..." John and others have never seen such a galaxy hanging over the scene, and it was shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ordinary houses on both sides of the street, countless candles lit up, and a pair of eyes greeted their new lords from the window and from the cracks in the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is a bit nervous, because the coronation ceremony needs to be sworn under the holy light, can your faith pass the inspection? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She feels a little in her heart, her head is slightly slanted, she sees a dark-haired man standing behind a window, the handsome face, the monocle of the surname It’s all that familiar and intimate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she saw Lucien, she couldn’t help but lift her mouth, and her heart settled down, even the legendary strongman’s pursuit could be blocked, still afraid of what ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have no pity in your heart, no loyalty, no bravery? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being tall, Natasha’s stunning looks and heroic style gave the Holm Kingdom aristocrats and citizens a deep impression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking through the streets, Natasha and the honor guards just arrived at the Glorious Cathedral, and the first rays of the morning light hit her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the horse, stepping on the steps, Natasha took the hall in the salute of the ordinary aristocrats on both sides and walked to the cardinal of Sald. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the knees of the Holy Cross, after a question and answer, Natasha stood facing all nobles, his left hand was on the Holy Scriptures, right hand Lifting up, three fingers pointing to the sky: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I, Natasha Vaolirit, solemnly and sincerely proclaimed before the Lord:"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a devout believer in truth, I will follow the "Sacred Code" and the "Code" of the Kingdom of Holm, defending them with their own lives, for the maintenance of the Lord The glory and the interests of the Holm kingdom, to the death of the dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde stood in front of Natasha with a holy book, There was a soft light on the body to check her faith. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s peace of mind, in the light, tortured whether his actions were contrary to his own vows of the Knights, when denied In the answer, the light is bright and bright, like an angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde and slyly smiled: "You are a devout and determined believer, a brave and tenacious knight, you are qualified to become the Holm Kingdom. The king."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up the golden kingdom next to the red velvet and put it on the head of Natasha, which was slightly buried:<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I declare that the grace of the Lord, Natasha Vauririt becomes the queen of Holm and its territory and territory, the protector of faith, the Countess of Violet The lord of the Bilbis Islands, the lord of Solaho and the Baltimore, the Grand Duke of Emden, the lord of the most glorious sword of the Knights of the Knights, the most glorious ruling of the Knights, the oldest and most distinguished Holy Cross Knight The lord of the regiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
