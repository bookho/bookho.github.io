			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick nervously and reluctantly looked at the teacher on the podium. For him who is shy in his family name, the theoretical interpretation of standing up against the teacher is simply equal to Without any magical effect, I jumped from Allinge to the ground, but my heart’s cognition of the microscopic field made more and more loud shouts, which made him courageous and made a move that would not be considered at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A teacher will be angry? Will you be disappointed? Will you be angry? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no retreat to look at Lucien. Annick was surprised to find that there was no anger and disappointment on the teacher’s face, calm and deep, without any embarrassment. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think is the problem?" Lucy beheaded slightly as all the Arcans felt differently in such a scene of teacher-student disputes. The tone is calm and calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick takes a deep breath: "Observation does change the outcome, but observing is definitely not an explanation for the influence of consciousness or an intelligent observer. The observation is one. An objective behavior, intelligent life can, ordinary cats and dogs can, experimental devices can, microscopic systems composed of a large number of particles can also be, as to what scale will exist in the quantum superposition state, we have to continue to explore and study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just has vague ideas that cannot be accurately stated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too." Sprint found that Annick was not nervous enough to be vague, basically expounding the ideas he and he usually discussed. So I agreed with it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas also slightly decapitated: "Although there is no accurate mathematical model support, but this is a more objective explanation, Lucian, your theory is too subjective. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not speak, but the expression on his face fully indicated that he was standing on the side of Annick. Of course, this is not because he has no experimental results and In the case of mathematical models, they accepted their explanations, but in comparison, Lucien is even more ridiculous! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook, Oliver, Helen, Hathaway, Begner, Lavendi, etc. show the same attitude in different poses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But how does magic explain this? How does the magic explain? How does the power of faith explain? Annick, your explanation does not leave for extraordinary power Position." Lucien still maintains his own gentle attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick opened his mouth and wanted to refute it, but he did not know where to refute it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, don't force two irrelevant issues together, there is no magic position in the microscopic field, does not mean that there is no other field." Fernando Shen Said the voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien showed a smile: "My theory is only a conjecture for the time being, a conjecture that contains all the extraordinary powers, now in the state of air-to-air Disputes are a waste of time. We slowly explore and experiment and look forward to finding the truth of the world."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;唔? The Arcanists were not disappointed or relieved, and Evans did not throw out an irrefutable experimental and theoretical prediction to declare his victory, which is not in line with common sense! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is the normal situation! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien looked at Oliver, Fernando, Douglas, Annick, Sprint, etc. with a faint smile, and turned around: "I have three here." The experimental ideas that are temporarily unattainable are put forward here. I hope that they will be completed soon after everyone's joint efforts, which will give us strong evidence for the interpretation of the micro-domain."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the first experiment, we all know that temperature is the embodiment of the degree of molecular thermal motion, so as long as the movement of microscopic particles is contained, theoretically, an ice cold closer to absolute zero is created. Under the restricted environment, the microscopic particles may be in the same quantum state, and at the same time, we can accomplish many ideas..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien roughly described the use of strong Magnetic fields and lasers create traps that trap microscopic particles, and roughly describe how to observe the quantum superposition state of a particular microscopic particle in a very short time through appropriate experimental steps in such an environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, listening to Lucian's conjecture description, the magicians did not have much difficulty understanding, Helen did not even blink his eyes, which seems to explain a lot of incomprehensible places in his legendary magic of ice and snow? As for how to create a "trap", Lucien will not speak out even if he has an idea, and he needs to study it himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the big arcian, the direction is more important than any specific step! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver’s face is slightly gloomy and quite exciting. If the observation is true to the quantum superposition state, it fully demonstrates that the secret of the god is indeed at the microscopic level. field! However, the experiments described by Lucien are difficult and cannot be completed in a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not useful for explaining the reasons for the transition of the micro-domain to the macro-world, just to confirm the quantum states of many possible states mixed superposition..." Annick And Sprint pays great attention to the experiments described by the teacher, which helps to affirm the wonders of the microscopic field, but is full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not give them too much time to think, and continued: "In the magic experiment just now, we can make two more changes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One change is in the electronic through the double seam, to achieve self-interference, but not yet in front of the screen, we then decide whether we want to see its volatility or surname The particle's last name, and then the screen is processed for this purpose. At this time, what experimental image will be presented?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the problem? Now that it has passed the double seam, Then there must be interference, and the fluctuating surname must be manifested..." The arcane masters first thought of the subconscious, then chilled, and it was possible to happen in the microscopic field that violated common sense. Is it our observation? Will the facts that have already happened be modified? Then the law of causality in time is no longer strictly established? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien deliberately smothered the description of this experiment, lest someone prematurely complete, explode his head, and then continue: "The second change It is to record the gaps through which the microscopic particles move more undisturbed. However, after recording, the experimental device does not give an alarm sound or other signals for us to know, but immediately deletes the 'observation record'. Is there a fluctuating surname or a particle surname?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick’s face becomes pale again, this is to discern whether it is an observation of the experimental device or an observation of “we” ? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After describing the three experiments, Lucien spoke up: "My open class is here, do you have any questions?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arcanists are still immersed in the thought shocks brought about by the three experiments, and no one answers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas thought about it, peace and perseverance: "I also have a thought experiment. According to Lucian's interpretation, before the observation, the microscopic particles are in many possibilities. The probability cloud form of state superposition, and then, assuming that the particle has changed, splitting into two particles and moving away in different directions, this process has no observer participation, so the two particles are also quantum superposition states, and maintain the overall conservation surname. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When the distance is far enough, the observation of one of the particles will make its state fixed, so another particle follows the corresponding law and immediately collapses into Fixed state? Does this over-range effect violate the special theory of relativity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arcanists heard dizziness, scalp tingling, experienced today too A lot of thinking experiments, from Oliver's cat, Lucien's delayed experiment and "delete" experiment, to Douglas's entangled particles, all of them are destroying three-view thinking experiments, they are not too understanding and full of fear<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I predict that this phenomenon will occur, but it does not violate the special theory of relativity, because before the observation, the microscopic particles are expanded according to the wave function, permeating in space, everywhere The two particles are inseparable whole." Lucien answered with less accuracy and did not dare to be too accurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas nodded unexpectedly. "I will find a way to verify this experiment and see if your theory is incomplete or not."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, the open class that was destined to be recorded in the annals of magic ended, Lucian stepped out of the big classroom and squinted at the eyebrows and returned to his study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, Heidi, Reyia, Katrina and other students knocked on the door, on the grounds of asking questions in the micro-domain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
