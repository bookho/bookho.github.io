			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brons" used to be the estate of Natasha, the Countess of Violet, the driver is no worse than the "Bern" manor of Felice, the carriage is abnormally abnormal Driving on the crowded streets of Aalto, slowly moving to the musician associations in the administrative district, did not let Lucien in the carriage feel the slightest bumps.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aalto It turned out to be so lively. Through the half-open window, Lucien felt that Aalto had never seen an embarrassment. The people walking on both sides of the avenue were several times this time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the avenue On the top, you can see a lot of strange carriages. Because of the coat of arms on their carriages, Lucien is not familiar with it. "This is the coat of arms of the Viscount of the Holy Land of the Holy Land of Taran. This is the Baron of the White Kingdom of Syracuse. The coat of arms of the family... Oh, I can count as a heraldic scholar. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s study has books dedicated to aristocratic coats of arms, and this book accounts for a large part of the study, so although Lucien is not complete I have read them, but through the powerful memory and search comparison, I can basically understand the common heraldry.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at these with a little exotic In the carriage, Lucien turned his attention to both sides of the avenue, where the bards and street performers were able to see one every ten meters.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Uncle Joel? Lu Xien suddenly found the corner of the street, Joel is playing the "Ul" harp happily, although the two fingers of the left hand are missing, but it does not affect his playing ordinary music with this simple instrument. Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instructed the coachman to park the carriage on the street, Lucien walked to Joel, smiled at him, and listened to him playing the warm and romantic A serenade.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedestrians around have applauded, and some have taken out the copper nart into the hat in front of Joel.<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they didn't recognize it. The quiet young people who were smiling next to them were the talented musicians they had been talking about before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After the bombing, Joel humorously said to Lucien: "It’s hard to be a long time at home. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John is favored by Sir Wien, and Lucien often finds various reasons to look after them. Joel and Eliza can pass even if they don't have to work. It’s a very good life.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien doesn’t think Joel loses his face: “I can see that Uncle Joel, you are very happy, you can simply enjoy the music. The happiness brought is a very beautiful thing. Joel had no concern about the copper nart in the hat.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "To be right, the arrival of the Aalto Music Festival rekindled my enthusiasm, so Going to the streets again, but no longer for life. "Joer got the understanding of Lucien, and he was even more happy. "I seem to have returned to the past. It was not long before I came to Aalto. It was like their dream of being full of music and their obsession with music. After so many years, finally I found this beauty again. He pointed to the strange bards and street performers nearby.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are totally different from their counterparts in Aalto for a long time, they are working hard. Playing his own music to the pedestrians, showing his own voice, I hope to get appreciation, affirmation and not money.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien likes this simple Beautiful: "I saw them and my mood became happy. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So this is why I like the Aalto Music Festival. Joel laughed, then picked up the seven-string "Ur" and played the harp, playing a soothing and melodious music.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien Watching him immersed in the world of dream music, without disturbing, after standing quietly for a while, he walked around and enjoyed the performances of bards and street performers, and occasionally threw out a few copper nairs to express his affirmation. "Home" has been parsing magic at home for too long, and Lucien has some memories of such a lively and lively scene.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from their different flavors of music from different countries In the middle, Lucien is also absorbing the essence and perfecting a piece of music that he has created.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of music is not plagiarized, but the world of adaptation The third piece of the very difficult "G minor sonata in g minor", after Lucien adapted it into a piano piece, he made no small changes and treatments on rhythm, strength and speed, so it was in his own Performing a performance at the concert.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Walking slowly on the street, Lucien found that he really liked this vibrant city. The melodious music and the lively scenes were so beautiful: "If there is no church, then it will be fine."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This gentleman, come to listen to our concert? Free!" Suddenly, I ran a man around the age of twenty, and he sincerely invited the way. Sean, the green eyes are full of enthusiasm and expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien asked questionfully: "Concert?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, sir, We rented a big house on the street to hold a concert and invited everyone to listen for free!” The brown-haired fluffy man introduced the speed very quickly. “Right, I am Piola, the band’s first violinist, you. Would you like to participate?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien was ready to listen to the time before 2 pm, and smiled and nodded: "Where?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piola cheered: "The thirtieth audience!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he took the road Sean turned into a street and entered the lobby of a small two-story building. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a temporary stage in the center of the hall with two violins, a viola, a cello and a don’t know where to borrow. The harpsichord, a long black hair, a light blue dress, and a mature girl with a full body are sitting on the bench and guarding the instrument, and there are already more than twenty people to listen to the concert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Piola introduced Lucien, he smiled apologetically: "Sir, please wait fifteen minutes, we will invite more friends." During this time, Grace will play the harpsichord for you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien probably understands what is going on, they should be from Bands from other countries, taking advantage of the Alto Music Festival, come here to pursue musical dreams, but because they are not famous, there is not enough money to rent the concert halls in Aalto, and even if they are rented, There are not many viewers, so you can only let more people know them in the form of free and simple concerts, get affirmation and make a name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Peora went out, the girl named Grace was playing the "Dedication to Silvia" with the harpsichord. The beautiful melody sounded in the ear of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This song is easy to learn, and Grace plays well, but Lucien frowned slightly: "The harpsichord can't produce that purity." It feels like the flow of spring water, and the melody effect is so bad."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of its other advantages, the harpsichord does not Immediately eliminated by the piano. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After four or five roads familiar with Xi'an, Piola and two other men and one woman have drawn more than 20 guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the guest has crowded this small room, Piola decided to start the concert, he took the stage, picked up the violin, and eagerly sighed: "We are the band from the Pearl of the Sea 'Stulk', I am the first violinist Piola, this is the second violin Sharon, the violaist Green, cellist Leslie, the harpsichord Reese, welcome everyone to participate in our concert.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see that they are in the original city, and often hold similar free and simple concerts, so the experience is very Rich, from the beginning with a lively serenade to mobilize everyone's emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some small works such as Fantasia that they created themselves. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Lucien has no real creative ability, but the Aalto Musicians Association has been listening to it, the piano has reached a certain height, so the music is identified. The ability is still very strong, nodded slightly: "There is a spiritual surname, there are a few good melody, the harmony is also done well, but it is far from being excellent." Their basic skills are good, even in Aalto, Can become a qualified musician, unlike most bards who have developed habits, they can't change them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In less than an hour of the end of the succinct concert, due to the free, because the Aalto people really love music, Peola they got a warm applause, which made them Very encouraged and very excited, so they all stepped down and prepared to exchange their music with the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
