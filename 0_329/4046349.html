			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Council Headquarters, 18th floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seventh lab is spacious and bright, with different locations and specially separated small rooms with various lines of cold and sharp alchemy platform, as well as a rune complex mystery The magical array, the light of different colors, set off the whole room like a dream under the silver metal wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lab, only the magic apprentices such as Lucian, Lazar, Rock, Jerome, and Annick, none The guests came to congratulate. After all, for the Arcane Masters of the Magic Council, the beginning of an "Arcane Research Project" should have been like this. The name of the "Atom Research Institute" is eccentric, but it is also approved by the Magic Research Committee. The research project is definitely not going to be celebrated like the completion of the building or the establishment of the school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien is enjoying his leisure, and he has no idea of ​​inviting guests to hold a "banquet." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the "Atom Research Institute" was established in such a state of no concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the host of the "Atom Research Institute", Lucien cleared his throat and said with a serious expression: "Our research has not yet begun, our The companions are still very rare, our achievements have not yet appeared, and everything is just getting started. The front is a new field, the world that has never been developed, waiting for us to explore it and open up it. I believe that on this path, We will appreciate the wonderful scenery and harvest the fruit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A serious saying", Lucien is more and more interesting: "Today Hey, we are proud of the Magic Council. Hey, the Magic Council is proud of us!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of excitement and enthusiasm in the first few words of Lucien. The crowd suddenly stunned, and the ambition seems too big, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that everyone’s expression changes have achieved their goals, Lucien puts aside the jokes and begins to allocate research questions: “I have to wait to participate in the monthly At a regular meeting, Lazar was responsible for the specific affairs of the institute. Jerome took half of the apprentices to change the names of various substances at different low temperatures, temporarily focusing on common substances such as charcoal, iron, and Mithril. Since we want to study the things behind the law of elements, we must be familiar with the surnames of matter, and so far, no one has done experiments on various material changes under ultra-low temperature conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My request is to make a record every degree Celsius, maybe I can find something from it. This is a tedious, elaborate experiment, Jerome you have patience, the name is warm It is suitable to complete it, right, be careful of ultra-low temperature damage during the experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, the research on ultra-low temperature of the Magic Council has remained at the level of liquid hydrogen , the temperature required for superconducting is still At a distance of about ten degrees Celsius, such a bottleneck can be solved until the suffocation is discovered. Lucien did not think that they would find superconductivity now, but at a temperature of minus 180 degrees, charcoal would be wonderful. The change, it is very easy to absorb the air, is a weapon to create a vacuum, once combined with the existing similar magic array, will be of great help to Lucian's future research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the name is "Atomic Research Institute", it must be to study the material changes, so Jerome has no doubts and nods to undertake the task. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rock, you took another half of the apprentices to study the gas discharge under different pressure conditions. Larry and K are close to perfect ionization theory, which proves that the solution is conductive. Because the dissolved matter is divided into positive and negative 'ions', what is the gas discharge because of it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ion" is Larry and K name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Rok also no doubt promised, Lucien once again looked at Lazar: "You are in the middle of coordination, which side needs help, which side, if No, you can do your own experiments."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, I will stare at them." Lazar laughed, "Lu Xien How many things are in your head? With just one result, you can be keenly connected with other things, no wonder the legendary arcane thinking."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This is because I first thought of another thing, and I just grabbed a result to cover it up. Lucien himself ridiculed himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the corner of the corridor, Lucy En met Isabella and Rachel, who came here for research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked each other well, Isabella seems to have endured for a long time and hurry and ask: "Evans, what is your formula?" After completing the thesis of the five Arcanists, it was found that it is difficult to explain the meaning of the formula from any angle. Is it necessary to make a premise of subversive cognition?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Every serious arcian who can read the "Arcane" journal has fallen into similar confusion during this time, and some people are crazy about it. After all, as long as a little curiosity and ambition, face seven When the Arcanists are discussing the issues, they will never be able to think about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I have recently found a direction and are working hard." Lucien revealed a little bit about the progress of Fernando and Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh? What direction?" Isabella and Rachel asked with surprise, and they never thought that Lucien could make progress. The question just mentioned is just a kind of catharsis of the accumulated emotions after encountering the parties. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words just exited, the two ladies quickly woke up and even apologized, indicating that they did not intend to inquire about the contents of Lucien research. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled uncomfortably: "My hard work is nearing completion, and my teacher is clear about the details, so I have no direction in revealing the direction." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can that tell us?" Rachel saw the teacher full of curiosity but was embarrassed to speak, so the smile asked affectionately. She thinks that Lucien's attitude is normal. If his teacher is a great arcian and knows his own progress, he does not have to worry about others winning the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the perspective of the molecular movement established by my classmate Chloe, the probability is introduced into the formula." Lucien almost opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella nodded thoughtfully: "The new theory of Chloe has been perfected since its initial proposal and has been perfected for more than a decade. Controversy, he was tortured until he got the Ice and Snow Medal because of the interpretation of the second law. The opposition was much less, but unfortunately still not liked by most Arcans, so even if you want to explain Evans your formula, Few people will start from this perspective."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has an urge to try and try to analyze this formula according to Lucien’s disclosure. This is not to pre-empt the publication of the paper, but the simple arcane master's persistence and curiosity about the problem, as is Rachel's side. At the same time, Lucien decided that the relaxed and calm attitude made them believe that he probably completed the work of formula interpretation and only submitted the paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Fernando's study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the placement of the Institute, when Lucien arrived, Chloe, Soup, Asikana, Leahy? Carter has been gathered, only the crystal dragon Affris is missing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tang spectrum, how did the small crystal not come yet?" Axikana likes to use the nickname Afreus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang spectrum pushed the gold-rimmed glasses: "I haven’t seen it for nearly a month, and maybe I sold it myself because of greed..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone is not certain, but I don’t worry about the safety of Aphrodite, as long as it does not leave the five-kilometer range of Allinge, it’s fine, I don’t know it. The bottom is definitely not able to beat it, the possibility of being tricked by it may be higher, and it is not too boring to know whether it originates or not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry about it, it's very safe." Fernando said in a simple and concise manner, "Let's start talking, starting with Chloe."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chloe slammed back from meditation, looked at Fernando, and looked at Lucien: "I explored an underground magma cave last month..."
