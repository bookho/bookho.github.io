			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he succeeded in meditation during the apprenticeship of the magic apprentice, he induced the "starry sky", and Lucian immediately suppressed all kinds of doubts and began to look for the stars. Belong to his own "star of destiny." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is vast, boundless, starry, endless, but after the soul and the spirit are combined and extended, Lucien quickly comes from countless stars. Sensing a familiar taste, it is their own taste, so Lucien fluctuated his mental power and slowly moved closer to the still weak star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the spirit of the soul feeling finally touched the illusory star, and then Lucien followed the idea of ​​meditation, a little bit Spiritual power blends with this star and connects. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien’s mental power was like a string being struck, swaying violently, and the soul began to oscillate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearing that this is a necessary process and a crucial moment, Lucien continues to extend the rest of his mental strength, and the volatility of the volatility is almost broken. The spiritual line of the opening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spiritual line gradually became a starry star, and slowly stabilized, and Lucien’s soul was shocked, and there was one more inside. The reflection of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greed to extract the soul and spirit from the star-like spiritual power line, Lucien is immersed in the idea of ​​astrology In the middle, until the soul has a feeling of fullness, it stops and uses the elemental thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Lucien did not use the power of the surrounding "ground, fire, wind, water" to temper the soul and spirit, but only through the meditation, enhanced Spiritual and "element" induction, the stronger the induction, the faster the elemental magic can be applied later, even if the magic of the imprint model is constructed, it can shorten some magic buffer periods. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien felt a kind of exhaustion from the depths of his soul, he ended his first meditation, opened his eyes, deep black There is excitement and joy in the pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even in normal circumstances, I can sense the reflection of the main star of the soul within the soul. If you concentrate, you can even feel the vagueness in the distant sky. There is a star with my mysterious and inexplicable connection, you can borrow a little bit of its power, and the spiritual line does not seem to exist, in another time and space."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lu Xien thought with joy, but soon he noticed a strange place, "Wait, I am crossing, why is this world having my 'star of destiny'? According to the astrology Theory, if the former Lucien died, his main star of destiny would be bleak, slipped, or disappeared, and the familiar feeling just now belongs to the taste of my summer wind. Why is this? What is the reason?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpected reasons explain, Lucien can only temporarily put doubts down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time through this meditation, and a thorough interpretation of the witch's magic notes, Lucien understands that to feel the mental state of others, you must use the corresponding magic Unless it is not long before the breakthrough, the mental strength is still unstable, can be directly found, and Benjamin should have judged that his mental strength is slightly higher than normal by his own crying, not what he said. The magic trap left by the witch is dedicated to a few people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is also a corresponding magic to converge or hide mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short break, the excited Lucian opens the witch's magic notes and is ready to see which apprentice-level informal magic he can currently learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "Fate of Death", Lucien can already learn the only three apprenticeships in the magic of the stars, that is, the witch becomes a high-level magic After the apprentices learned, in the apprenticeship magic, it is a very powerful type, but because of the lack of mental strength, Lucian used the effect will be worse, and after two or three times, the mental strength is withered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The division of magic apprentices, from the perfect state to the dry state, how many apprentice-level informal magic can be used as the standard, the trainee is five, the official is ten The high-order is twenty, that is to say, Lucien can only use five apprentice-level magics at a time. If you want to use it again, you have to rest or take magical medicine to restore your mental strength and use the stars. The apprenticeship of the department, Lucian is likely to only use three in a row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, astrology is the signature magic of the star system. According to the witch, even if it is primary, it needs a lot of knowledge, such as the rules of some stars, how to properly choose other stars in the divination match with the star of the destiny, etc. It took her a few years to barely use it, but because of the lack of knowledge, the results of the astrology are basically inaccurate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the eyes of Lucien, the most awkward thing about primary astrology is the magic crystal ball made of pure, rare morning crystal. Assistant, I don’t know where to look for it. After all, the witch family has only one pass from generation to generation. Unfortunately, she carried it with her and was taken away by the church. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a complex astronomical and difficult-to-understand knowledge of primary astrology, but Lucien feels relatively easy, a large part of which is the high-level celestial mechanics. The chaotic description, and the hand-painted astrological maps by memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the main star with the choice of the stars, Lucien still has to learn slowly, because this is the part of his knowledge that cannot be understood, just like not understanding why the stars will Representing the same fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but thinking that he will carry a magical crystal ball for astrology in the future, Lucien has a subtle feeling of rising, if he wears a black magic The robe is more like the feeling of an evil magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Eye of the Stars is similar to hypnosis, and the magic of people who need to look at their pupils. I don’t know why they are divided into stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Ring of Out of Control" in Lu Xien’s view, borrowed the gravitational force of the stars to form a three-dimensional thick one that can slightly change the gravitational pull. The ring is mainly used for defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a short break, Lucien decided to learn the first magic in his life, targeting the "out of control ring." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because the eyes of the stars need the casting material "Night Star Grass" powder, while other elements are similar to apprentice informal magic, such as "frost ray" "Requires "calcite" powder, "acid sputtering" requires "sulphur", and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there is very little magic that does not require casting materials. It is basically the magic of other factions, such as the Master of the changing system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Lucien can also learn other faction magic, but the apprentice’s thoughts are two kinds of astrology and elements, in learning these two magics, It's a bit easier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the cast spells recorded in the witch's magic notes, Lucien concentrated his spirit and sensed the stars in the night sky through the "star of destiny" in the soul. It hangs down almost invisible power, then whispers out the mantra, swearing and quirky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, after Lucien read the mantra, he clearly sensed that as his vocal vibrations, the spiritual force followed the fluctuations, and the wonderful Change, combined with the gravitational pull of the stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Lucien quickly changed his mentality in accordance with the simple rune of the "Out of Control Ring". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, due to unskilled, Lucien has not changed the runes, the combination of mental power and the gravitation of the stars has ended, and the spell has failed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two breaks to restore mental strength, Lucien failed five times and finally succeeded in changing the rune pattern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lightly invisible light under the control of Lucien, successfully appeared on the repaired wooden table, allowing the candlestick to be in the magical range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucian’s escapement, the flame on the candlestick was low and slammed, and the hut was dimmed and changed. A gloomy and terrifying feeling was produced, and it was not until two minutes later that the flame returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien clasped his hands and meditated: "The range of gravitational changes is too small to allow the attacker to have weapons out of control, light and heavy feelings, and You can't let the weapon fall to the ground, or fly in the air, it's just an apprentice-level magic, you have to cooperate with your own dodge to defend."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the cast time is too long It took a full five seconds, but after proficiency, it should be able to compress to about three seconds."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
