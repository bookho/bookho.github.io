			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midday sun is shining, and the study is golden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Douglas and Lucien have left separately, only Fernando sits quietly on the chair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, the two giants discussed the issues submitted and published by Lucien, and decided to add a few more papers to the next issue of Arcane. ——Several Arcanists explored the law behind the formula from all angles but failed, so that most of the Arcanists would not be directly affected by the subversive assumptions that emerged in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to let them accept the results of Lucien now, after all, the premise of "energy discontinuity" is only on the assumption, but let them read These articles have a psychological preparation. From a normal point of view, there is nothing that can be done. Maybe it will be explained beyond the accepted concept. At the same time, in the added articles, the archaeologists will repeatedly emphasize that it is necessary to solve the problem. Assume that the word "hypothesis" is impressed by the re-presentation of the word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stunning, ridiculous, subversive cognition..." Fernando said to himself that Ruthen’s hypothesis was made and smiled slightly "The upper part of the paper sent to other people has actually rejected other explanations. The second half that has not been sent out is only the complete explanation, analysis and premise of the formula. I don't know who can first according to the first half of the paper. The Ministry draws the content of the second half, making the assumption that it is unacceptable, Hathaway, or Brooke?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatherville is atomic theory The founder, based on this understanding, she tends to Douglas's particle theory, is most likely to make similar assumptions, the other four arcanes are standard wave schools, especially Bruker is the most determined, but these five Among the great arcans, Brooke has the strongest strength and is closest to the world. He has the possibility to complete the derivation first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I guess they came to the conclusion and came to me in the order, Hathaway, Brooke, Oliver, Helen, Vicente?" Fernando behaved as humorous as usual, with a faint smile on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his own words, his eyes turned, and he suddenly saw the whole mirror in the corner of the study. The mirror reflected an old man wearing a red magic robe. Silver hair is like a cream, and the roots are black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smile solidified and gradually disappeared. Fernando raised his right hand and touched his white hair, then sighed softly and took an old one from the desk. The notes, turned to the last few pages, and the feather pen wrote:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "July 6th, sunny, breeze, suddenly felt that I am a little old." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the quill and turn his head to look out the window. The bright sunshine stuns his eyes slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Go home. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the steward, Leo, looked at Lucien’s face in a strange way, but did not say anything, but ended up studying and preparing for lunch. Plint is curious to ask: "Mr. Evans, why is your face so bad? Is it difficult to answer the question of the storm today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you are He snarled violently? This is what Sprint hasn't said in his stomach. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The face is poor?" Lucien asked questioningly, then turned to look at a crystal statue placed in the living room, although the scene reflected above was blurred. Paste, but Lucien can clearly see that his face is as bad as he just climbed out of the graveyard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure of legend is so horrible? I have neglected a lot under my own "confrontation". I only remember that the whole body is cold and sweaty, the air is solidified, the eyes are flashing, and the ears are thundering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the teacher's question is difficult to answer, it is about saving the world and defending peace." Lucien smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint couldn’t stand the cold humor from his teacher from time to time, and twitched his mouth quietly: "Evans teacher, don’t be kidding, is the storm dominated the Lord? Want to destroy the world, but you are stopped?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Splint, you said the opposite, I want to destroy the world, but it is stopped by the teacher. Although his face was poor, Lucien was in a good mood. After all, he did not blast his own teacher's head and threw out the assumption of energy discontinuity, so he joked happily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching the servant squirming out of the food and looking at the veal that had been eaten many times, Lucien couldn't help but lick his forehead and had to try other forms of food. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea was just up, the servant led Katrina and came in. Her supple blonde hair was ponytailed, lively and jumping, and her face was filled with great joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Teacher Evans, your application for the 'Atomic Research Institute' has been approved." Katrina raised the documents in her hand and said loudly and cheerfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was quite surprised: "So fast? Only a few days?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arcane Is the approval of the research project not more than two weeks? It seems that it’s just a week before I submit my application. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With the support signature of the Great Arcane Master, how can the gentlemen of the Magic Research Committee drag and drop?" Katrina said first-hand inside information, then very Looking forward to authenticity, "Evans teacher, take a quick look at what it is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The file is sealed in the bag and requires Lucien’s arcane and magic badges to open. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Should it be approved?" Sprint has been waiting for the "Atomic Research Institute" to be established for a long time. After seeing the document, it is both expecting and fearing. It seems nervous and uneasy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien calmly removed the Arcane Badge and placed it on the magic mark of the bag seal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A touch of light flashed, the magic mark disappeared, Lucien took out the file, read the beginning carefully, and then smiled at Sprint and Katrina: "The gentlemen of the Magic Research Committee have agreed to my application and said that this is a new form of research organization. I hope that I can work hard to set an example for the approval of similar projects in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great!" Sprint waved his fists and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina is a little more steady, but also smiles, even the channel: "Congratulations, Teacher Evans, congratulations, Evans teacher..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Heidi and Reyaliya know, it is estimated that they will cheer "mystery on the spot" on the spot? Lucien opened his arms and accepted the hugs and congratulations of Katrina and Sprint. His heart was silent: "You, your social experience is still too shallow. The meaning of these sentences is clearly, 'Look at the storm. To rule your part, we agree with your absurd so-called new form research group, but you have to make some results, otherwise your face will not look good!'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Evans teacher, where is our institute?" It was a little calmer, and Katrina immediately looked at Lucien with her eyes wide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien picked up the documents and looked at the following: "The seventh laboratory on the 18th floor of the Parliamentary Headquarters and the affiliated conference rooms and offices. Let me also Within five weeks, the requirements for the lab magic array, the alchemy array, and the large alchemy unit will be reviewed, and the Magic Research Committee will review and adapt the lab accordingly, which will take two to three weeks, that is, at the end of July or early August. Our 'Atomic Research Institute' was formally established."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, in addition to the basic transformation, the monthly subsidy for us is 5,000. Arcane points, used to buy materials, complete experiments and pay salaries. I initially decided that high-level magic apprentices are ten arcane points per month, and formal magicians are based on specific levels, such as Lazar. The second-level Arcanist and the Second Ring Magician are one hundred arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The host of a research institute like me does not get a salary Anyway, "personal experimental wear and tear" is reported in the research project, Lucien is in the stomach. Mo added a sentence. This is the unspoken rule of the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So much?!" Sprint and Katrina blurted out with amazement, this is the standard of the official magician, to know that Evans The teacher has only ten arcane points in the magic school for one month! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the "Atomology Institute" can also see the free arcane basic books provided by Evans teacher, you can also use the lab for free, buy the experiment at cost price The material, coupled with such a high salary, is simply the work of the magic apprentice and the formal magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
