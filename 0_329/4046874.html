Lucien was really surprised this time, this is more than a year, the Speaker of the House is ready? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled and said: "When you find the sun, my preparations are nearing completion. The time of the year is mainly used to verify the existence of the sun. Incorporating the 'real world feedback' with its own research experience, and arranging the auxiliary magic array, and pushing the door of the gods does not require any special legendary materials, but more depends on the accumulation of the past, such as the cognitive world. Forming and curing, such as the true sensing of the main star of destiny, etc."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, as long as you can understand the nature and key of this auxiliary magic array, the arrangement is relative Simple, much less than the three or four years I estimated in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is similar to the magical array of the advanced class of Thanos, Viken, etc. No special legendary material assistance is needed. As long as the state transition is completed, the power of emotion and the power of faith are accumulated. By mastering the complexity and special features of the magic array, it is quite easy to prepare. Not to gather the power of faith before The power of emotional needs time spent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When talking, Douglas’s smile was peaceful and kind, and there was no excitement, yearning and excitement, anxious about the impact of the level of the gods, not knowing Lucy more than a year ago. En found the emotional exposure of the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would it be too urgent?" Lucien has always been self-sufficient and lucid, and is good at decision-making. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas shook his head with a smile: "The preparations are all done, and now there is no difference between the impact and the impact of five years and ten years. Know me." The legendary peak of promotion has been close to three hundred years. The reason why I came directly to you is that I am still worried about it. Brooke is smart and cautious, and her heart and mind are full, but her personality is gloomy. She prefers to immerse herself in research and lead the parliament more reluctantly. Fernando and Hathaway have different defects and are not suitable. Therefore, if my failure fails and I cannot survive, I hope that Lu Xien can shoulder the responsibility of leading the parliament."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He probably analyzed the other three legendary peaks, looking at Lucien's eyes slightly eager. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lord of the Speaker...you will definitely have nothing to do." Lucien said subconsciously, then solemnly and sincerely, "As long as I am still alive, the Parliament Do not die."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled with satisfaction and reached for the shoulder of Lucien: "After that, I will trouble you several guards." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Guardian? No problem, Lord Speaker, are you ready to go to the alien space impact?" Although there has never been a clear record of whether the impact class is There is a vision, but according to the performance of each major stage promotion, Lucien undoubtedly believes that the movement will be very amazing, and it has long been judged that Tanos is in the alien space, the dead world, etc. The promotion of the hidden secrets in the place is either within its own half-face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the legends of the ancient magical empire were not noticed at the time - every door in the "world of the door" was equivalent to an independent space Wicken may have survived Maskinin and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of Douglas is different from them, and it needs to recognize the world and the real environment corresponding to the cognitive world - its own semi-position, obviously not in the semi-position In the end, you can only go to places such as the alien space or the dead spirit world. Otherwise, if the movement is too big and takes a long time, it will definitely lead to Pope Viken, "Lord of the Lord" Maldi Moss, Pope of the Northern Church. Wait for the strong to obstruct. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas is a little helpless: "My promotion is not only based on the cognitive world and my own half-plane, but also the main star of fate, and it is in the soul. The inner projection completely overlaps with the soul, the cognitive world and the semi-planet. This process will be greatly hindered in places such as the alien space and the dead spirit, and the difficulty will be increased many times, so the main material world can only be selected. Rely on the lock of Allinge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long does it take for this shock process? If time is short, Wicken is absolutely too late to come, just need to guard against 'the Lord of Hell 'Well, our three legendary peaks rely on Alin's lock to stop him." Lucien's expression became dignified. When faced with a god, the Magic Council is now more than passive, and you come to me. Inadequate response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Council has not studied the formation of "vision". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can only be done for forty minutes first... I think 'Silver Moon' should be happy to have more than one reliable ally, after all, Viken holds Platinum scepter, the key to borrowing the power of 'Heavenly Mountain', I will go to the dark mountains again." Lucien analyzed the situation, "but it is necessary to prevent someone from arbitrarily putting 'the will of the abyss'..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silver Moon" Aitna stopped Pope Viken, and his three legendary peaks blocked the "Lord of Hell" with the help of a lock, barely enough, as long as there was no other big The change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas tone became solemn: "I will go to the Dark Mountains with you and talk to 'Silver Moon' in person."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been carrying the magical parliament for hundreds of years. It is not the kind of person who wants to face death. Naturally, if he wants to seek help from others, he must first show his sincerity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay." Lucien nodded first, then hesitated: "Although it was only five years since Vicken became 'Benedict III', It’s not yet time for him to recover completely, but we all know that the real reason why he uses less 'God' is that the body is consumed so much that it can't be recovered, and the monster Viken is scrutinized. At the crucial moment, with his character, there will definitely be no What hesitates, so we should anticipate the 'God Fall'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Would you have to find a way to bring Viken away? "With Douglas's wisdom, there are naturally many plans and plans, such as attacking the heterodyne space controlled by the church, or making ways to rescue the monster Viken." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought for a moment and hesitated: "There may be a better way..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prayer room of St. Gono Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Saint" Clemente is quietly repenting before the cross, the last time he obeyed the command of "King of the Angels" Mekantron, went to "Chaotic Starry Sky" took "time and space slate", but met Lu Xien, almost swallowed by the high-energy storm created by "Yang Electronic Gun". Fortunately, it was rescued by the "Hell Lord" who has been working together for a long time. He learned from the mouth of "Lord of the Hell" that "The King of Angels" Mecan Tron was almost completely degraded, and he was afraid of it for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are no more than the "king of angels" Mekantron is the "God of Truth" Tanos prepared for himself, as long as the paradise is not destroyed, Re-born from the glory of the Lord, if you are affected by the horrible legendary spell of Lucien, you will definitely fall down! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--About the "the truth of the resurrection" of Mekantron, he knows from the mouth of "Lord of Hell". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My 'the power of virtue' was collected almost, but there is still a lack of a 'container'..." Clement from "The King of Angels" The book of Virtue obtained from Cantron is replaced by a positive symbol such as honesty as a substitute for negative emotions. The corresponding hidden dangers are not so large. It is not necessary to capture a legend as a container, and it can rely on the refining of materials. Special utensils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the two branches that appeared after the perfection of the gods and the roads of the Wickens. The reason why there is a difference is because Tanos is equal to starting from scratch. No longer limited by negative emotions and ancient devils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the materials needed are hard to collect." Clemente thought with distress. "If it is not Gono, it will die long ago, only power and God." Sexual inheritance, the body can only be borrowed by the gods like 'Hell Lord', I can use his body directly as a 'container'... Why I passed on the power of Gonow, not St. Ivan, St. Felix and others..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as he secretly laments, the outskirts of St. Ivan are being shrouded in darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Ivan in the late autumn has been as cold as Ariel winter, and a breath will condense "white fog", and the night is particularly moving. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a rolling but not steep hill, a carriage with a horse-drawn lantern is quickly heading to the manor at the foot of the mountain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin coachman has a big red nose, wearing a coat that is not too thick, driving the horse while pouring himself a spirit, as long as there is Wine, he will not be afraid of the cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
