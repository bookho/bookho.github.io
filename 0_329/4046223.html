			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 13th floor of the "Holm Royal Magic Tower" has two heavy iron-gray metal gates at the end of the corridor, along with the Rodem starter Open, there is a dark chaos inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is the elemental will and Holm Royal Defence Court each own one-half of the half-face warehouse. It is said that this half-face is Lord Hathaway's The magic tower is there.” Lazar had been here since he joined the will of the element. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien tried to use his keen knight's keen eye to visit inside, but unfortunately could not penetrate the chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, please come in." Rodham meticulously made an invitation gesture to show the etiquette from the royal training. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded lightly and did not hesitate to step inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if from a thick layer of fog, Lucien saw the stars in the sky, it will be wide and invisible through the transparent crystal ceiling The marginal warehouse is full of clearth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing in the warehouse, everything solidified, until Lucien, Rodham and Lazar came in and resurrected and became vivid again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rodham, why come in." The cold, cold sound came from every corner of the warehouse, and the atmosphere immediately suppressed and dignified, as long as Rodm answered If not, there will be a terror elemental storm coming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rodham came up with a mysterious badge depicting the symbols of the ancient magical empire: "Mr. Zidman, this is the opening of the warehouse by Lord Morris." The token, there is an order for you, and Mr. Evans's right hand is the Holm crown ring, you should recognize it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" The icy sound of the cold sound, the mysterious badge in the hands of Rodham disappeared abruptly, and Lucien, standing next to him, could not find out how it was missing, whether it was mental, intuition or visual inspection, as if "Zidelman" What is done in the warehouse is simply anomalous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Soul Library Earth knowledge is very useful, Lucian, occasionally inevitably produce a point of contempt for the magician's emotions, but at this time it is born with strong strength and Unknown awe, there is a lot of knowledge that you can't understand in magic, you can't be complacent! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the main energy of Lucien’s future will definitely continue to change and transform the knowledge of the earth into arcane and magic. Only fools will give up their own Strengths and strengths! It is not too late to study other magical knowledge that is temporarily unclear until most of the advantages are turned into strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, in this process, part of the effort to delve into the three magical roots of soul, consciousness, and spiritual power is what every qualified magician should do. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Verification is accurate, Mr. Evans can choose pharmacies, materials, unique magic, magic items, magic arrays, rare records worth 2,000 arcane points Books of knowledge, etc." As the voice of Zyderman reappears, the radiance brought by the surrounding starlight slowly recedes, revealing one magic frame and one magic cabinet, which are numbered and filled with items. Some of the colors are as faint as the fascinating things, and some of them are fascinating and fascinating... Lucy is looking at this item more than the ground, which is more swaying than the magic tower left by the legendary magician Maskillin, because that There are only magic materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly resisting the heart, afraid of redeeming some strange things, Lucien quickly followed the instructions of Rodham and Lazar, and went to the full A place on the coat rack with a different style of magic robe, cloak and mage hat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Davi's Robe (Pseudo), the highest-rated panel member 'creator' Davy Rodel's imitation of the legendary magic robe, nine high-level It can reduce the casting buffer time of three seconds, provide the defensive power equal to the six-day knight, and enhance the magic resistance to the level of the nine-level master. It takes the spirit to reach the level of the seven-level magician to wear it, otherwise it will become an idiot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it’s just a copy of the magical robe, its value can’t be measured, only enough to make a contribution (10 million arcane points) or A normal Duke territory, Hou Guolai exchange. - Davy? Rodel"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first shape is similar to the ancient magical empire style hooded black robes almost Sparkling Road Sean's eyes, this is the best magic robe I have ever seen! By reducing the castback time of three seconds, the magic below level 6 can be uninterrupted, and the enemy is destroyed like a storm before the mental energy is exhausted, and the magical spelling time of level 6 and above is greatly reduced. It is really an item that a true magician dreams of. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulling his eyes out of this magic robe, Lucien saw the exciting equipment such as the seven-level mirror magic robe that can bounce the ranged attack and the single damage magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Lucien found two magical robes suitable for his own property and level: "Water Leprechaun Magic Robe" and "Deformation Robe" - - Other magical robes are either too expensive or not suitable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water demon magic robe is only worth 1,500 arcane points, constant "glorious", "glamorous" two magic effects and three levels Knight's defense ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magician who wears this magical robe, whether it is a man or a woman, will become fascinating and be sought after by the madness of different surnames. Often you will enjoy incredible discounts and even post it. Please note that there is no possibility of being chased by the same surname and being harmed by a loss of reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the introduction, Lucien shuddered and felt that his charm seemed to be good, so he put it down and picked up the "deformation robe." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three-level mid-level magic robe, constant 'appearance deformability', and provides the magic resistance of the three-ring magician and the defense ability of the second-level knight, while daily It can be transformed into a mouse, an owl, and a troll."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The change is the shape, the constant is the heart. - Asongsang? Phillips" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This "deformation robe" is worth 1,960 arcane points, which is more expensive in the same level of magic items, but Lucien thought I thought, I decided to choose it because it made up for my shortcomings in some way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Magic Council, Lucien borrowed a lot of books, there are magical knowledge of the changing factions, but unfortunately involved in the body deformation, Lucien learning It's very difficult, I can't figure out how to solve the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the above description, the human body deformation needs to first dissect the body of the deformed object, understand and remember its specific structure, magic lines, etc. (without understanding the principle), In this way, you can parse and learn magic, and the transformation is successful. Lucien is no stranger to anatomy, and the principle of how to deform after dissection can take a long time to learn, because it has its past cognition. Fortunately, he knows that this is a magical world, can expect and accept similar things, otherwise the deformation magic will never want to learn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this magic robe, Lucien only needs to provoke it to get the ability to deform, which may play a crucial role at some point. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After telling Zidelman and Rodham, Lucien showed his appraisal, leaving a spiritual imprint, wearing a deformed robe on his body, and then mentally In one move, this ancient magical-style robes turned into black double-breasted long dresses with pants and shoes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining forty arcane points, Lucien has exchanged ten bottles of deep purple medicine to help the soul and mental strength "Florensa's "Essence", intends to take a bottle a month to make up for the "Elemental" ring blessing under the meditation efficiency of the rapid improvement of the foundation instability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two thousand arcane points are used up in a blink of an eye, Lucien just wants to say Lazar and Rodem leave, Zyderman’s voice is again It sounds: "Mr. Evans, since you are the Holm Crown Award winner and an honorary member of the Holm Royal Devils Court, you can get a random gift. The magic items on your body are higher than the number and grade. The low-level magician, so I will send you a book."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, Lucien’s hands naturally emerged as a cover that is elegant and does not look like other books. book: "magic item with science", author: Fuluolunsuo? Lanka? Constantine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned over at random, inside is a study about how to avoid the two magical items being too close to each other, such as Lucien wants to Wearing a ring on all ten fingers requires two conflicting magic rings to be separated, with a cushioned ring in the middle. Because it is difficult to find a suitable fit and the magic items are expensive, most magicians wear two magic rings at most, and they are not in conflict. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking deeply at this treasure-like warehouse, Lucian and Lazar followed Rodem to the half-face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ Early the next morning, the six-pointed star platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey! A sharp whistle came and the dark blue magic steam train stopped in front of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a well-dressed middle-aged ordinary man in the car. He looked up and looked at Lucien and then walked out with others. Platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien and Lazar slowly walked up and sat by the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............When leaving the platform, the middle-aged ordinary man is getting faster and faster. After arriving at a remote alley, he takes out a reel and tears it open. , posted on your face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred sacred light illuminates, the man’s hands are blue, it seems very painful, but he endures until the light disappears and the hand has a transparent "paper". On the paper is the Lucien image he just saw. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magical technique actually extracts what he sees in his eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he wrapped the piece of paper and went to a remote church, sitting in the front row of chairs and praying quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the prayer was over, he looked quietly and peacefully, and the piece of paper was left in the seat next to it, letting the priest who came out get it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper was passed through layers and eventually appeared in the hands of Cardinal Filipe, the bishop of Holm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the latest winner of the Holm Crown Award, Lucien Evans? X? It seems very young."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned his head to the cardinal and referee giants in front of him: "I will upgrade his rank to the elimination level. If there is an opportunity, he will send the vigil to clean him, and I will wait until the last time. Accumulate enough and pass it to the Great Hall of the Holy City."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is the winner of the Holm Crown Award, but Lucien’s own strength is low and nothing has been done. The sensational thing, not yet qualified to enter the purification sequence, even Felipe, the immortal throne winner, was able to "promote" after sweeping the face of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your will is our will." The referee giant Greenton humbly said, "But it is difficult to destroy him. On the one hand, this potential magician Will definitely stay in the vicinity of Allinge, no chance, on the other hand, the mid-level night watchman will be killed by his Holm crown ring, unless it is a cardinal level watchman. But it will face the element The will and the magic parliament doubled revenge. If there is an opportunity, I want to apply for the use of the holy things."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall strength of the Holm parish is better than the Vaolirit parish It’s a few times stronger, or it’s been wiped out by the Magic Council. They have enough ability to support the opening of the transmission array, and the holy city to help. Philip Bell nodded and sighed: "The Magic Council has so many geniuses in recent decades. Fortunately, after several popes reformed the foundation of the gods, We are not bad either."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalling the Pope's transformation of the magic, several cardinal and referee giants revealed a little complex emotions, and they were fortunate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Allinge, the 35th floor of the Magic Council headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twenty-four members of the highest panel of judges came to the 19th place, all seven arcane masters arrived, and eleven legendary magicians reached eight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to the information passed by Malfurion, several elders of Druid are unwilling to cooperate with us, so they are doped in the druids that come. A lot of 'natural hate faction' members want to destroy, and there are a few of them are the direct blood of the elf royal family. Malfurion can only do it, don't know, let us deal with it." The old man with a clear blue eyes and a clear bottom is slowly saying that he is wearing a black night dress and a bow tie. He is tall and full of kindness. "It is related to the fact that we are cracking the mystery of the magic, and there can be no mistakes." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"President Douglas, are you calling us for this problem that is not even a problem?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking is a short, handsome old man in a bright red robe. He has a silver hair with a lot of black silk, and the red pupil is bright and powerful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
