			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The streets of the Municipal Plaza and the nearby administrative districts are crowded with people, and the black pressure is like the tide of the night. Some of them have a tearful touch of tears, some belts. Excited mood shouting Lu Xien? The name of Evans, especially the people who walked away from the crystal wall that disappeared after the music stopped, even with tears on his face, shouted over and over again:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Lusien? Evans!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No music has ever touched their hearts like this, with everything they can experience in their lives, Unbearable suffering, hardship, brilliant victory, true joy, and the music and devout tribute they like from the heart, so when Fabrini sings the beginning of joy, they will go from soul to body. Uncontrollable tremors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling did not calm down after the end of the symphony, so even if they could not see the hall, they could not see the unparalleled music. The masters brought to the world from the true God are still venting, expressing worship, respect and love. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind the crazy scenes, in the halls of the shrines that they can’t see, a small number of aristocrats, pastors, and bishops who are still sensible are hard to react. Looking at Lucien wearing a black tuxedo? Evans fell to the ground with an elegant but tragic feeling like a fallen angel. This scene is remembered in their pupils and remembered in their memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as if there was a silver-violet lightning strike through the space, Natasha in a purple evening dress suddenly appeared on the stage, and she fell to the ground in Lucien. He hugged him before, then slammed his feet and quickly flew back to the VIP box, leaving only the aristocrats who were insane around the stage stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her reaction is faster than anyone, and when everyone recollects it, it adds a lot of awkward conjectures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bishop Cosei, please treat Lucien!" Natasha kept the calmness of everyone's habits, but still revealed in her tone and eyes. A little bit anxious, and her long, slender right hand was clasped with Lucien’s right hand and refused to let go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal Cesare solemnly painted the cross on the chest: "Only the most devout believers of the Lord can create such a sacred and grand symphony, so the princess Your Highness, you can rest assured that God will not let Mr. Evans die, and I will try my best to heal him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor anxiously wants to confirm Lucien The situation, but Natasha is like a mother who guards the child, guarding the knight of the lord, holding Lucien in her arms in a way that excludes others, and how the hand refuses to let go. This allowed Victor to only be able to turn around in the rest of his heart, watching the sacred light of the truth of the goddess holding the sacred light shining on Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha quietly puts the power of her own knight's rank into the body of Lucien through her clenched hands, suppressing and covering him. The soul is abnormal. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gossie because Lucien is not on the verge of dying, just using regular divine inspections, there is no direct explosion of all forces to observe from inside to outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few tens of seconds, in the eyes of everyone watching anxiously, Cossie smiled: "Mr. Evans is just sick and too excited. Fainting is not a very serious matter. Of course, if he does not receive treatment and then drags on for a week or two, even if he has the power of the knight, he will really die. But now, I think everything is fine, the main meeting Bless him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therapeutic magic is not a panacea, at least in the church's point of view, it is to stimulate the vitality of the person to heal. If this person has lost vitality due to long-term illness, and when there is not much left, he has to declare that he is on the verge of true death, that he will be called by the Lord, and that he will not be able to heal the healing the magic, unless it is in myths and legends. The "Resurrection" performed by the God of Truth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what did Cossett not say, Lucien? Evans seems to be a second-level knight, but he thinks about his "relationship" with Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why can Lucien be sick? As a young knight, if it is not a plague or a very poor physical condition, he is unlikely to get sick. After listening to the less serious, Natasha asked calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien had not used it to treat it after using "disease surgery". It relied on the self-healing ability of the second-level knight to make it develop into a lingering natural disease through magical diseases for many days. So as not to be seen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cossie silenced for a few seconds before answering: "Maybe because Mr. Evans had not been treated in time for visceral injuries."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I understand, please ask Bishop Cesare to treat Lucien quickly." Natasha is very clear about the current situation, and there is no entanglement in the cause of illness. The most important thing is still Rescue Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal Catherine stretched out his hands and released a pure light full of sacred meaning. After it was taken on Lucien, you can clearly see Lucien A group of smog is like a black smoke made up of countless small "bugs" that are hard to see by the naked eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three-level magic "Remove disease", not powerful, not high-order but very symptomatic healing magic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha, who still suppresses and obscures the abnormal soul of Lucien, sees those black tiny "worms" slowly turning into white smoke in pure light, completely disappearing, The face "oily" reveals a sense of relaxation and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the expression of their daughter, and looking at their right hand with their fingers crossed, the mood of Grand Duke Ouette is very complicated, both A father who loves her daughter witnessed the embarrassment and anger that she was about to be turned away by a bastard kid, and she finally returned to normal, no longer worried about her being attacked and bloody. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Dagong’s complex expression, Count Lafayette whispered: “The quasi-knight is also a knight, at least inspiring the blood, and finding an ordinary person than casually. Much better."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke of Vaolirit revealed to Count Lafayette and others that whether or not they inspire blood, whether or not they are nobles or Whether or not Natasha was really brought back to the right path, as long as the daughter was able to marry and have a child on the surface, he agreed with one eye and closed his eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah..." Waulite sighed long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the implementation of "Removal of Diseases", Cossé used a four-ring magic "recovery", and then everyone saw Lucien Slowly opened his eyes, it seems to be a little confused to look around: "What's wrong?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor cares and deplores the truth: "Lu Xien you pay too much attention to the body With such a serious illness, you still have to create music, but you still have to hold a concert and you have to direct yourself! Is this necessary? Can you postpone the concert until your health is in your current position? Will it be forgotten by people?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of questions touched Lucian’s emotions and he was a little moved to answer: “I was wrong, Victor teacher. But as you know, with inspiration and creative passion, you can't stop it. Well, I will take a rest and nursed back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gossett is slightly jigsaw: "Mr. Evans, your illness and not all good injuries have been cured, but you are passing Too much energy is consumed, and it takes a long period of rest to restore the weak body."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, Lucien, that scene was really scary. I am the old man's heart to stop beating, but it is worthwhile to hear the "Happy Ode" symphony at this price." Christopher saw Lucien no problem, only half of it was fun and half relaxed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Natasha first spit a little, then seriously to Cossador: "Bishop Coss, I will send Lucian back first, Then discuss with you the problem of his injury."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natasha, remember to tell me the news of nothing to Franz, Fabrini and Everyone else who saw me fall, don't let them worry about me." Lucian turned his head and said to Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha nodded gently: "Reassure, I will tell the guards to announce that your most important thing is to rest and recover."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing their sideless conversations, seeing that the restored Lucien still resisted in Natasha’s arms without resistance, the two almost breathed, the Great Master of Vaolirit The expressions of people in the VIP boxes such as Christopher and Victor have all become slightly weird and embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
