			<div id="content">- Oh, in the case that the Great God has not yet exerted force, Sanjiang is the first, thank you, and ask everyone to continue to support ~......................................................... .............................................<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After determining the instrument that Lucien was going to learn, Victor stood up from the couch. Clap your hands: "Exactly, two days ago, Mr. Rhein and Mr. Xavier have completed the transformation of the harpsichord. Lucien, you follow me today to try its effect, huh, huh, because of its tone, volume and The width of the range is far beyond my imagination, even better than all other instruments, but the sound quality is a little bit worse, so I think it is no longer a harpsichord, but it is a brand new, revolutionary Musical instrument, Lucien, you really start your own music path from this brand new instrument."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be clearly seen that for feathers Victory is very satisfied with the results of the transformation of the pipe key, usually just a smile, good at keeping the wind He is full of a bright smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since it is a brand new, revolutionary instrument, it should be Mr. Victor who proposes an improvement. You give it a formal name." On the way to the piano room, Lott smiled and complimented. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor looked at Lucien and smiled kindly and asked: "Lu Sien, what do you think it is called? This brand new instrument, you There is also a lot of credit. It is better to make comments. Let us refer to it. Mr. Rhein thinks that the mechanical structure of this instrument is the most complicated of all instruments, which fully reflects the beauty of mechanical art, so it is called mechanical keyboard, hehe, he The violin playing is almost an art, but his ability to take a name, but...hehe."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor, although not finished, but whether it is Lucy Well, still Lott, Felice, Herodotus, all know clearly, he thinks the Rhine is incompetent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about Mr. Navicto and Mr. Xavier?" Lucien did not directly name the piano, but asked him with a little curiosity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Xavier thinks that this is the chord, because it is a combination of a stringed piano and a harpsichord, hehe." Victor smiled. Shaking his head, apparently disapproving of the name. "I think it's called a harpsichord, because the stringing piano is also called a harpsichord. The harpsichord is a harpsichord. The new instrument has a very wide range of sounds, almost including All.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Actually, you are all named incompetent..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the way The fact that Sean, Lott, and Felice almost silently complained at the same time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought about it, couldn’t accept the three names, so No politely said: "In fact, the harpsichord is also called the plucked piano. It is the same as the string piano. It is often referred to as the piano, and the word is full of mechanical taste, which is in line with Mr. Rhein. The idea, as well as the meaning of strong and weak changes, is the main feature of the sound and volume of this new instrument, so Mr. Victor, I think, as a direct call piano well. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the word is different from the earth, Lucian can only mix the original ideas to force some reasons.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;“None...” Felice finally heard a good name and was preparing to agree. It is conceivable that Mr. Victor has not spoken yet. He is so aristocratic and may violate Mr. Vic’s preferences. So I hurriedly shut up, suddenly, like to satirize someone else's Felice, the beautiful face rose red, very compatible with her flame-like hair, looks particularly beautiful.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Lot, Herodotus is okay, just clicked on his head, and he woke up and laughed at Felice.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor抿Pouting: "Piano, good, good, very good, including the thoughts of Mr. and Mr. Rhein, so we don't have to argue again. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stunned and almost laughed. It turns out that Mr. Victor gave me the name because of the dispute with Mr. Rhein and the choice of name. Whoever does not obey anyone.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, on the second floor of the piano room, handsome and almost fascinating silver hair, wearing a favorite red and black, sitting in the "piano" In front, the long hands stretched out, the shoulders and arms barely moved, and the soft and compact songs were played lightly and compactly. The sound of the piano was delicate, like the whispers of the night, and the whisper of the lover, let the people who heard it I feel quiet and immersed in the atmosphere of music.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Rhein, I can't think of your MIDI playing in addition to the violin. It's not so good than Ms. Silvia!" Felice's face turned red again, her eyes shining, and she was a little excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine just used a string of piano (single piano) to test the effect of "piano" in this range and volume, it sounds Innocent, and Silvia is the best musician of Aalto playing the harpsichord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the harpsichord is suitable for indoor performances such as the piano room, living room, bedroom, etc., the sounds and suitable songs are deeply loved by noble ladies and girls, so West Ervia often became a guest of a noble family, invited to participate in the banquet held by the count, the Viscount, and even rumored that she and Princess Natasha are close friends. With such a background, Silvia is the most versatile of the Musicians Association. a musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine stood up, his right hand raised his chest, slightly stunned, like a musician doing the final thanks, then he smiled and shook his head: "I It’s just that the skills are more mature, and the music is far worse than Ms. Silvia. At least I can’t write the music that was just so beautiful.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp On the side of Lu Xien looked at the book "Harnon's Piano Fingering" in the Soul Library, "Chopin's Transformation of Piano Fingering", "Xiao Bangyun's Fingering Discussion" and other books. Compared with the action of the rhinestone performance, the heart nodded frequently: "Sure enough Fingering, melody and music are all restricted by musical instruments. When the instrument has new improvements, the fingering will change gradually, and finally form different styles. The tone, volume and range of this piano are close to modern pianos. Eighty-eight keys, with strong sounds, sustaining pedals, etc., the most suitable is the modern piano fingering of various styles."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the earth, subject The limitation of instruments such as harpsichord, the original playing piano is only three Fingers, until Bach "deposited" the thumb and the little finger, they participated in the performance, and then, the influence of the tone of the harpsichord and the volume change is difficult to use with the strength of the fingers, musicians They use the technical "decorative sounds" such as vibrato and echo to replace the continuation and intensity of the sound. Therefore, the piano music of this period, including Bach's "Average Piano Collection", is full of gorgeous decorative sounds. It is impossible to highlight the pure melody, and there are few loud and rushing music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the piano was born, the piano’s music and fingering began to change dramatically, such as Chopin’s second “de-release” of the thumb and little finger. Let them also have black keys, such as Chopin's original finger, pad and other fingering. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stood quietly and watched the introduction of modern piano fingerings such as "Harnon Piano Fingering". Victor has already discussed with Rheinland. Call this brand new instrument with "piano." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, come over, sit in front of the piano, I teach you basic fingering." Victor suddenly shouted Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was a little embarrassed, a little excited and hurriedly walked over and sat down on the bench, just sitting up, it felt a bit wrong, according to The description of the fingering entry, the height of the piano seems to be lower, so he is busy to the side of Victor: "Mr. Victor, can you raise the bench? Or change a bench of ten centimeters tall?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is a bit strange: "Lu Xien, you are not much shorter than Mr. Rhein, this bench should be just right."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien reached out and gestured to Victor: "This height is only suitable for using fingers and wrists. When I need to use the swing of my forearms, hind arms and shoulders, it is very stiff. And the distance is a little farther, the hand is too straight and not sensitive enough."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Noisy! Lucien, quickly take you from the pub, the street The unofficial and wrong way of playing is forgotten!" Victor ridiculed Lucien in a rare way, lest he go wrong. The road, "Don't you see it? Mr. Rhein is just playing with his wrists and fingers. When will he get the forearms, hind arms and shoulders?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp Luisen guessed that Victor would have such a reaction, because some changes in modern piano fingering were unacceptable to some famous pianists at the same time, like Liszt and others using the forearms, hind arms and shoulders to swing. As well as the high and downward free-falling power to produce the magnificent effect of the piano and the more intense sound, it was criticized that it was not playing the piano, but "playing the piano." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, don't think about the so-called unconstrained pub, the suburban style will outweigh the formal, perfect music education, if you can't correct these shortcomings You will only be a bard, and you will not be a qualified musician." Herodotus, who always hated Lucien, finally seized the opportunity to fall on the road to Sean. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
