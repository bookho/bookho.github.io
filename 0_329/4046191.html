			<div id="content">Razal nodded with a smile: "Of course, as long as it is a new magic that the Parliament does not have. And compared to the review of the paper, the new magic of creation and improvement only needs to be summoned." The magic exchange room's alchemy life is compared with the previous magic and confirmed to be released. The 'Arcane Review Board' gentlemen can be assessed in as little as 20 minutes."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, Ximeng next to him added: "However, Evans, you have to remember, although you can get the Arcane points, activate the badge, but later you want to get the official Olympics At the level of the skill, that basic arcane score must be obtained. Because the parliament requires every magician to have a solid foundation of arcane, and then become an arcane master before choosing his own research direction."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will find time to pass the arcane assessment of the 'Sorcerer's Management Department'." Lucien's tone usually replies, just like saying what to eat for dinner today, but West Both Meon and Lazar thought that Lucien meant waiting. On completion of those arcane and magic books, make up the foundation, you go to apply for assessment as soon as possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the magic apprentices such as Annick, Lucien walked to the four districts under the leadership of Lazar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Simeon has just become a second-class arcian, and has great hope to break through to the middle." While walking, Lazar is on the road to Lucy. I sigh, "I don't know when I can have thirty Arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien asked after questioning: "Arcane How many Arcane points do you need to upgrade each level?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was originally said to be a multiple of ten, but it would be too exaggerating to get the arcane points needed later. After all, there are only one or two thousand arcane masters in the whole world. Therefore, a legendary magician who likes the concept of 'everything is the same' has added the 'three' level to the middle. It has become like this. Ten Arcane points become first-class arcans, promotion to the second level requires 30 points of Arcane points, 100 points of three levels, three levels of three hundred, five thousand one thousand, six three thousand, seven one Ten thousand, eight 30,000, nine hundred and ten thousand." Lazar likes the feeling of being asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When walking, there are light shining from time to time, and the two badges of Arcane and Magic worn by Lazar are faint and radiant, letting them retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The "Magician Management Department" has an open-plan hall with light yellow sofas, coffee tables, bar counters, wine cabinets, etc. It gives people a feeling of easy and open-mindedness, such as salons and clubs, which are better than management. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the passage leading to the back office, lounge, and data room, there is a reception desk made of silver-gray metal, standing there is two lively Cute girl. The magicians who come and go, as long as they are not rather gloomy, like to tease them a few words, there are also young people who are looking for them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Lazar, have you finished your reception anymore?" One of the taller, flax-colored hair girls smiled and asked, she was wearing a long bud Skirt, handsome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar smiles again and again: "Of course, Cindy Little Sweetheart, you didn't see Mr. Evans next to me? A 20-year-old official The magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he pointed to the two girls: "Evans, they are Cindy, Donna, let the 'Magic Management Department' full of laughter Sweethearts, all graduated from high-level magic apprentices, are working at the same time, preparing for the impact of the official magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the temptation of Lazar's sweetheart, Cindy Just a white glance at him, no more to say, Jiao Xiao looked at Lucien: "Welcome to you, Mr. Evans. The 20-year-old formal magician is a genius wherever he goes, especially if you are still ancient. If you become When I was a middle-level magician, I still haven't broken through. Can I accept an apprentice? Real apprentice?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, I want, don't forget I!" Dona, who is short but full-bodied, shakes her long brown hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not think that they were so enthusiastic, for a moment, a little embarrassed, do not know how to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazard laughed happily: "Evans, it seems that you don't have much experience with the female surname. They just like to joke with this. Ways to welcome new wizards."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought that I suddenly became full of charm and was warmly welcomed by the girls." Lucien hummed humorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cindy’s clear, beautiful eyes stare at Lucien: “In fact, Mr. Evans is really charming, handsome and calm, and People are a little melancholy and mysterious, hey, I am more attracted to Mr. Lazare.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That’s really sad for me.” Lazar made Sad expression, then try to be serious, "Mr. Eric, are they in the office?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smiling Dora pointed to the channel behind: "The other gentlemen are very busy, only Mr. Eric is waiting for you, Mr. Lazar."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar argues that his charm is greatly reduced, while carrying Lucien walked to the third office with a smile on her face, and she wrote "Eric of the Magician Management Department". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently knocked on the door, a majestic voice sounded: "Please come in, the door is unlocked."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a slowly opening door, Lucien sees a row of bookshelves inside, not books on the bookshelf, but silver-gray paper with no wrinkles and bends. Like the foil, it sparkles with a fascinating glow, and a silvery line extending above them is connected to the wall surrounded by light blue light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the bookshelf, there is a dark black cabinet in the room, a cage with a bell and a metal shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a desk in front of the bookshelf, behind which is a bald man with a black suit and black tie and a half-height hat next to his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ordinary man, about forty years old, looked up, like the pale gray pupil of the crystal gemstone, as if he could see the road and look at Lucien And then bow down to write something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Eric." Lazar closed up the expression of laughter when he was with Cindy, Donna, etc., carefully and solemnly bent Waist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric nodded: "Welcome, new magic companion, come over to register and collect the badge. Lazar, your mission has been completed, with This note goes to the mission area to get paid." The note he just wrote in front of him flew to Lazar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar took the note and enthusiastically said to Lucien: "Evans, I am very happy with you, you are a good gentleman." I don't know if I am honored to invite you to dinner, I think we should be friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along the way, Lucien showed a steady and solid attitude "Spiritual talent" and gentle and casual surnames make Lazar feel that this is a friend who can have long-term contacts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Lazar, your invitation, I just can't find a place to have dinner." Lucien first arrived at the Magic Council headquarters, the most familiar people also It’s Lazar, and naturally I don’t mind a friend who is warm and kind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazard waved his note with satisfaction: "I paid the task and came to you after receiving the payment. Oh, you should have already worn it." The magic badge and the activated arcane badge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lazar left, Lucien walked to Eric and sat down, this is clear The silver star on the chest of Rick is three, and the black ring on the silver has four rings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three-level Arcanist, Four-Circle Magician..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silently thinking At the time, Eric took out a piece of silver-gray metallic paper and placed it on the table and gave it to Lucien: "You fill out the information for me so that I can activate the magic badge."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien took a look at the silver-gray paper, which only had names, ages, good factions, and magic levels to fill out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the background and the origin, the Magic Council does not seem to care. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that Lucien was not moving, Eric was not cold and cold: "The rest of the information you can fill in on another white paper, so the council is It will save a lot of work when you get the identity documents and documents of the Kingdom of Holm or other countries. Yes, if you get married later, please go to the 'Magician Management Department' to register, we have accepted many cases of magician heritage disputes. ".<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
