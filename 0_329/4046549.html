			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien seems to be able to feel the teacher’s expectation and headache, and the smile passed the paper: “It’s an attempt to explain the light speed experiment of Lord Douglas And the corresponding conversion relationship, there is nothing to subvert the surname, and there are commonalities with several hypotheses proposed by other arcians."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Lucy Enjoined the "Lorentz Transformation" used to psychologically pave the way for teachers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando took the paper with suspicion and looked at it, then the face was inexplicable and wonderful, and Lucien was stunned: "Teacher, what happened? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hey." Fernando snorted twice. "This is the second time I have seen this paper in the last two months." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slightly stunned: "Is there a similar paper submitted by the Arcanist? How can I find it in the archives of the Arcane Review Committee? If you know Someone has already suggested that I will not write any more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando temporarily put down the difficulties of "fission" and "fusion" and restored the old and unfair appearance. Hehe smiled: "I can't find it very normal, because he hasn't dared to submit it, just privately showed it to me and asked me for his opinion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Which archer?" Lucien asked curiously, and the surprise in his heart was almost eliminated. The speed of light experiment of Douglas Speaker Over the past three years, many undulations have said that supporters are seeking explanations for the volatility of this experimental phenomenon - must contain ether, and any of the arcane masters have come up with something like the "Lorentz transformation". strange. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians of this world will be subverted again and again, even if they have not discovered many things yet, but they are also capable of thinking about problems. not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s Oliver, who studied the issue three years ago after he bet with Florenza, but thinking has been intermittent because of the delay in finding new spaces It was only in the last few months that the entire equation of transformation was completed. He imagined that the length of the object would shrink in the direction of motion relative to the movement of the ether, thus offsetting the difference in the speed of light in different directions, which explains Douglas's experiment. Your paper should be like this too?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando just dared to just turn the beginning, thinking that this derivation will definitely result in similar Oliver papers, and there is no actual look Finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded and wondered: "Yes, why can't Oliver submit the paper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he is studying the Dark Dragon God, he can completely give the paper to Mrs. Florencia or the students and let them pass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because he thinks that the equation of transformation still hides a lot of important things, there is no way to explain why this phenomenon occurs. He has a preliminary idea. However, I can't deduct it. I think it is ridiculous, wrong, and unrealistic. I am looking for other directions, so I will seek advice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando He snorted. "My opinion is that his thoughts are not clear enough, so he can't understand how he wants to explain. I suggest that he find a time to discuss with you. You are a recognized idea. The most subversive and open-minded arcane master may help him find a new direction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folnando looks at Lucien like a smile "I don't think you have made this explanation. However, I remember that you have been indifferent to the existence of the ether. How can you suddenly explain Douglas's experiment based on it? Moreover, the problems in this equation, such as the length of the material shrink, believe You can see it too Come, there is a big problem, so, Lucien, what do you want to elicit this paper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I suspect that you have a deeper Level explanation, this is the introduction of this paper to allow the arcane masters to accept it step by step, come out, your real paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the teacher With a smile and a very serious red eye, Lucien just wants to say, "Give my parents, know my teacher too."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, just like this Tell the teacher about the special theory of relativity? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher, you are so hurt, you have forgotten the pain. Lucien still clearly remembers Fernando’s fury, sorrow and old age, but this kind of thing, he dare not repeat it again, it will lead to horror roar! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking, Lucien said in a tone: "I think the change in length is not the contraction of matter, but the contraction of space."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The contraction of space...a little meaning, the specific definition of space has to be changed..." Fernando due to the de facto existence of space barriers, half-planes, space magic, etc. There was no unexpected expression. "Oliver also thought about moving closer to this..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you abandon the ether, from Douglas's experiment, classical electromagnetic theory and Starting from the study of moving objects, we can propose a hypothesis that the speed of light is constant. In different reference frames, the speed of light in the vacuum is absolute, and the measured values ​​are constant." Lucien goes deeper. It also explains the specific arcane definition of this hypothesis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando clenched his fist in his right hand and gently licked his chin: "The speed of light does not change... With this assumption premised, a lot of things will be derived... you directly Take the paper out."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien quickly added: "There is also a premise that is the principle of relative surname. There are many papers in this area, teacher You should have seen it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the magicians often use the sound-like magic, they find that the other side is used separately in the case of flying towards themselves and running away from themselves. When the blasting spell is used, there will be no small difference in sound. One becomes very fast, and one pulls very long. It seems that the wavelength has changed. This is closely related to speed. It is discussed as a phenomenon explaining the principle of relative surname. The same There are also changes in the wavelength of the starlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando gently daggers and signals himself to know the phenomena and theories in this area: "There are only two premises? It is in line with the theory you advocate, from as few axioms as possible, Suppose that we start with a series of results through logical deduction. The paper is taken out, and I am mentally prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, it’s better for you based on these two The premise is to derive the transformation equation of Lord Oliver, giving the equation a new amount of arcane meaning, and not just mathematics." Lucian made a suggestion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando didn’t say so well: “I’m going to see what conclusions will be derived!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After he sat back on the desk, he picked up the quill, first listed the two preconditions, and then proceeded from them and began to re-introduc Oliver's transformation equation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, everything went well, and Fernando’s knowledge of the great arcans was so rich that there was almost no thought to interpret a bunch of equations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writes that Fernando’s feather pen stopped on the paper and could not be left for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black liquid of the nib is a little condensed, and slowly forms a small drop of water. Under the influence of gravity, it breaks away from the nib and draws a leisurely and beautiful track. On the paper, I smudged a small piece of black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thunder Hell outside the Magic Tower seems to suddenly become fierce, like a roaring roar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando looked up, his bright red eyes staring at Lucion in shock, as if to confirm something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not retreat in the slightest, his line of sight collided with him in midair, and there seemed to be the illusion of electric sparks bursting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and then continued to deduct, the line equation appeared, one by one conclusion, I don’t know when the time and space were created in the study. The taste of change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ruler, the quill, and the book have signs of contraction, and the beating of the wall clock seems to be getting slower and slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien closed his eyes, blocked his ears, and used his mental power to sense, only to discover that everything is not an illusion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this change is very small, and can be found by non-high-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the legendary magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long, Fernando put down the quill in his hand, looked at the results of the deduction carefully and intently, and laughed at himself: "I thought I I already have a certain understanding of the general appearance of the world, but now I find that everything is so vague, space and time are no longer what I originally thought, no longer intuitively, oh, time is actually speed. The function, depending on the substance, if it is not my own derivation, I will definitely find you speechless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up and looked at Lucien Very serious and dignified: "This is a conclusion drawn from the assumptions. It needs actual phenomena to prove. Otherwise, your view of time and space will always be a hypothesis. Well, you can explain the movement of some stars to the red spectral region. Phenomenon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is not fully accepted, provided that the things that have been logically deduced must be confirmed, otherwise it is just a good-looking toy, not any Righteousness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some problems with artificial planets can be started with the clock slow effect, but this theory is still incomplete, without considering the existence of gravity, but also a preliminary Explain, there must be a lot of omissions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took out some of the data collected over the years and the problems discovered by Annick and Sprint," ......The phenomenon of actual and theoretical deviation occurs when the cyclotron is used to accelerate the particle, but the introduction of the relativistic system can be well explained. The quality increases with the speed becoming faster, and the bypass cycle changes. We can use This formula calculates the amount of change and then adjusts the frequency of change of the electric field. If the particle can be accelerated again without leaving the electric field, it indirectly proves the existence of relativistic effects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is an action squad, directly calculus, then open the magic lab, turn on the cyclotron, and constantly adjust the frequency of the electric field change after the speed reaches a certain level. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Fernando got the particles of energy more than any previous experiment, and he sighed softly: "Lu Xien, you made the 'mystery' "Sound" puts forward the concept of world outlook, outlook on life and values. The view of the world in my view is the understanding of the world. Apart from the content of human history, it is equivalent to the cognitive world."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien does not know why the teacher said this, a bit confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando snorted: "The view of time and space is not only in the cognitive world, but also in the outlook on life and values. Therefore, Your legendary career is not as good as building a brand new one, the name is 'Three Views Destroyer'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, don't be kidding when you are serious... ..." Lucien is authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando looked at Lucien like a smile: "If it wasn’t for me that I’ve been subjected to the subversive shocks that you brought, I’ve started to hold on to any theory. Suspicion, I am afraid it is difficult to bear it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What you named as incomplete relativity must be thrown slowly, especially Douglas can see, This is a huge subversion of his theoretical system. It has been hit by the volatility of light in a hundred or two years. The quantum theory has challenged the continuous surname. I doubt that he will not be able to withstand this, although it will not burst his head and destroy. Half-plane, but maybe it’s like Brooke, and maybe there will be other changes psychologically...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Teacher, I didn’t think about it. Directly throw, you must see." Lucien shouted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer you spend with the teacher, the casual and lively side of Lucien’s surname will be shown inadvertently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando pretended not to hear: "I started with Oliver. Since he has found a problem, he should be acceptable, and then let him throw his paper, motivate him. High-level magicians think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is it a high-level magician?" Lucien was a bit confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando put away his serious expression and smiled and said: "Do you think that the following can be understood?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shut down the lab, returned to the study, and walked and said: "Your arcane points have already reached seven levels, and the discussion of the quantum and fluctuation theory continues, waiting for the new alchemy Feedback from the beginning of the surgery, plus the harvest of this paper, should not be difficult to become a level eight, but as long as you find the neutron, or you improve the paper, you can directly get the title of the Arcane Master, the points are not too much for you. Great meaning, hurry up to improve the magical power, this silver moon and the existence of the dead spirit should make you gain a lot, and the resources of the parliament will be completely inclined to you."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he arrived at the study, Fernando handed the paper to Lucien: "Look at what is missing? If not, I will not read your paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lu Xien glanced and found that the teacher missed the mass equation like Mr. Einstein of the year, so he smiled and picked up the feather pen: "Teacher, still a deductive."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feather pen fell on the soft and tough parchment, giving a rustling sound, Fernando carrying his hand and watching Lucian deducing, gradually, his expression was more dignified than ever, faint Excited brilliance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien feather pen keeps writing, has been written to the end, and then gives the general form of the formula:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...E=mc^2."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After brushing, a huge flash of lightning crossed the window, illuminating the entire storm Half plane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bang, the sound of the thunder that seemed to destroy the world, shook the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original part of the spell model is this meaning! Quality and energy conversion! No wonder 'new alchemy' can create high temperatures!" Fernando whispered excitedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice is almost roaring, and it seems that he finally found the direction to enhance the legendary career through "new alchemy", and he is good at electromagnetic, light and dark, elements, Heat, force field, and alchemy are integrated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the fusion and fission spell models, most of them are incomprehensible, relying on the discovery of phenomena and the depth of experiments, it is not possible to reverse crack in a short time. But the road finally showed a glimmer of light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Great Hall of Light, a member of the Cardinal in the Holy City of Reims Discuss the materials and reports submitted by Saarde. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The mental state of the Holm parish clergy and the night watchman is very problematic," said the head of the Knights Templar, St. Melmos, only reporting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the Cardinal members are silent, as it is evident from the report, the material and the previous facts, partly because the Pope improved the theology and the deity. When you talk indiscriminately, you will anger the Pope Benedict II. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we decide to go to war, the mental state of most of the priests and night watchmen in Holm parish will be gratifying, but the newly discovered space is rich. The population and material resources, and the evil organizations have been robbed, we are temporarily unable to distract." Pope Benedict II said with deep gaze, "I will punish the night watcher according to the proposal of Thrad, and mobilize the cardinal such as Amorton." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairy Bell of the Vaorrit Parish immediately expressed its agreement: "I am obeying the orders of His Majesty, and I will re-appoint a responsible office." The cardinal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other cardinal members do not care about themselves, no objection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glorious Cathedral, Sald saw a written reply, smiling Capri Paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, his finger strokes, Juliana at the end of the penalty list, but her penalty results are compared to the two vigils who housed the Austin Baron. People are much lighter, and the two are executed. She is imprisoned for one year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let Octtaf come over." Thrad commanded the cardinal through the divine array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, in the bright red bishop’s robe, Octave from the cardinal The bishop's study came out, his face was unusually gloomy, and he was deprived of the position of the head of the referee. This is the real position of the cardinal next to the small parish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A radical night watchman will appear every year. How much does this have to do with yourself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping a voice that listens to the mystery, what is the big deal to the magical parliament? Is it against the teachings of the Lord? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church is getting weaker and weaker! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Glorious Cathedral, Octave felt countless sympathetic eyes, and couldn’t help but yell: "His Majesty, did you see it?" They are sympathizing with me and are questioning how you deal with them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;June 20, after the funeral of King Fertis and Prince Patrick. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha, a black conservative dress, met with the Duke of James, the Duke of Russell and the Earl of Pine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The result of the punishment of the church has come out. The two night watchmen who were working at that time will be executed by the referee, and the rest of the night watchers will be punished to varying degrees. You will pass the result to you. The family of Baron Austin also helped me convey my mourning." Natasha painted the cross on her chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James is a little dissatisfied: "Just punishing the night watchman? That part of the madman will not be afraid. In the future, do we always live with fear? We must punish the person in charge of the referee. Let them wake up, and immediately check out the night watchman of the referee. All the extreme tendencies are controlled and erased. This is the view of some of our nobles. Her Majesty, this is also to protect your safety. The madman should not live. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This punishment decision, he is almost acceptable, can not directly provoke a war with the church, can make the church to make such a degree of concession is not bad The reason why he used the title is to test Natasha's attitude and inclination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Russell and the Earl of Pines are attached. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha solemnly said: "Duke James, Duke Russell, Earl of Pine, this is the fault of the church, not optimistic about the extreme night watchman, but their apologies Very sincere, I think the result of this punishment is acceptable, and the murderer has been executed to be able to comfort the Baron Austin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, the head of the referee, Oktaf Red The cardinal has also been revoked. I believe that Saint-Salt will slowly control the madmen. Your request is correct, but it is too radical. There is no room for relaxation. There is neither the Lord’s benevolence nor the teachings. Leave the other party with the time to complete the request."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of James was a little disappointed: "Since Her Majesty is considered acceptable, we have no opinion."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Nexus Palace, Russell and Haisong both squeezed into James' carriage, and the three fell into an unspeakable silence until Russell sighed as he approached the villa. Tone, broke the repression: "The Queen's Majesty from childhood Affected by the church, it is also a conservative growth of Aalto's growth. It is normal to be slightly biased towards the church. It is not necessary to be too pessimistic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am afraid this is just the beginning. Her teacher is the light of God, Beria." James gloomy face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Pines nodded and lowered his voice: "Be prepared early, then you won't be at a loss, we have to make some arrangements."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, there was a sound of dragons and horses galloping outside. A knight staring at the movement of Nexel Palace leaned against the carriage window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" James recognized this as the loyal knight of his family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knight’s expression is very strange, and it seems like a surprise: “The queen squats down to the Royal Tower of Holm to see the elders!”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The count of Haisong blurted out, and there was such a change. What happened to the world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holme Royal Magic Tower, Natasha in a room The spacious living room was waiting to meet the members of the Holm royal family here, and looked proudly: "I am really grateful to those radical night watchers, otherwise I can't find an excuse to come here. When the Duke of Rex asks, I will say In order to appease the enlightened aristocrats, hey, the church is in a loss, and will definitely agree with my actions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she knows that the Holm Royal Tower is the limit It is impossible for me to go to Allinge. It is also the name of the royal family and the royal family. There are many royal members. Without good reason, it will not stimulate the church and the conservative aristocracy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
