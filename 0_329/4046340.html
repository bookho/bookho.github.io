			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close to the time when the Magic Council headquarters was closed, Lucien came to the Magician Management Department with a paper modified according to the guidance of the storm master. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, Teacher Evans." Katrina, standing behind the reception desk, was pleasantly surprised to see Lucien appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is tall, bright, well-dressed, youthful, and has a strong appeal to many unmarried formal magicians, so the Hall of Magician Management is even close In the evening, there were also several young men staying. Some of them pretend to be wine tasting here, every move is extremely elegant, and some deliberately exchange the latest arcane theory, from time to time to find words that ordinary people can not understand, in order to demonstrate their own arcane and magical ability, Some are more daring, simply by asking the opportunity to talk with Katrina and the girl around her, causing other magicians to glare. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing that Katrina was clearly filled with joy, they and other girls in charge of reception were turned to Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jun Xiu's quiet face, neat and elegant costumes, and the beautiful dreamy lilac gemstone ring on the right index finger instantly caught their eye. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, is that Holm crown ring? Evans teacher? Lucien Evans?!" They quickly reacted, this is One of the most outstanding of the current generation of young magicians, the rumor is already a five-level arcane master! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So many magicians got up and saluted, "Good afternoon, Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At the same time, they are all guessing the relationship between Lucien and Katrina. According to Katrina, the two should have a certain sense of mentoring, but it is certain that Katrina is not yet Lucien? Evans's official disciple, otherwise she should directly honor the teacher, not the surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, they also have an envy of Katrina, though Lucien? Evans is still a mid-level magician, but has been recognized as one of the most promising sorcerers. The Holm Crown Award and several of his essays fully demonstrate his accomplishments in the arcane. The improvement in the level of magic also means that his level of arcaneism is not simply a sudden rise, but a deep foundation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a teacher, the future is definitely bright, at least it should be no difficulty to promote the official magician and the arcane master - can be recommended to this position, explain Katrina's arcane and spiritual talents are outstanding, lacking is the teacher's teaching and accumulation of resources. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed to the surrounding magician, Lucien walked in front of Katrina and smiled: "Good afternoon, Katrina, what are the deacons today? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Eric, Mr. David...all in" Katrina uttered six names in one breath, "Evans teacher, you are coming to submit "Is the paper?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien's slight jaw: "Yes. The application may have to wait for a while, you should not worry, but also to others. Tell me a little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No matter whether the application can be successful or not, it is a great thing to follow the teacher." Katrina noticed that everyone was envious. The gaze, the more I think that the decision I made is correct and appropriate, such an opportunity does not fight, I am afraid I will regret it later! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucian sat down with satisfaction and walked to the back office with a faint smile. The goal was naturally Mr. Eric, an acquaintance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl in charge of reception around Katrina looks at her companion and Lucien? Mr. Evans is familiar with laughter, and his heart is full of envy and faint inferiority. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he is also an outstanding graduate of another magic school "Allinge", his arcane and spiritual talents are excellent, and the same looks are beautiful, the pursuer There are so many, but when I first saw Katrina, I felt like standing with her. I was like a little mature girl who discussed arcane and magic. She was more insightful and often made herself a white school. The illusion of the year. I finally adjusted my mindset and comforted myself. Everyone has their own strengths. When I saw such a scene, I immediately raised the fate of Katrina and the powerless feeling of the gods. I couldn’t compare myself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina smiled easily: "My teacher and Ivans came across from the mainland on the same boat. He was instructed a lot on the road. Later he was lucky enough to meet him at Douglas Magic School. He got his private in private. Counseling."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is fate..." The girl sighed softly and said what other magicians around wanted to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an underage girl, Katrina still has a little bit of a little girl’s mind, and she can’t help but show off in her heart. Road: "Evans is still a disciple of the storm, and I will not talk about it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............"One thousand one hundred Twenty-four arcane points, sixty-five arcane points, Evans, you become a five-level arcane master a year faster than I expected." Eric handed five silver stars to Lucy Well, the face is still a suspicious smile. "The development of arcane in recent years has made people feel like they are breathless. If they are a little slack, they will find that they can't understand the contents of the journal."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past ten years, in the field of arcaneism, new discoveries and new theories have emerged from the ground. Even Lu Xien, who came back more than a year, found everyone discussing The problem is a bit "advanced." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Eric, you haven’t gained much in the past year, and the level of the Arcane has been upgraded to level 4." Lucien sighted to Erie. The gram's arcane badge became four silver stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Lucien’s words, Eric’s face seemed to shine: “Evans contributed three of your Arcane points. Yes, are you submitting the paper?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien didn’t mention updating the magic badge, Eric didn’t think about just over a year. Time he was able to move from the third ring to the fifth ring, so the topic was transferred to the magic-processed parchment held by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, the inspiration from this mission, the essay in the field of illusion." Lucien submitted the paper to Eric, and I was very much looking forward to it. After all, this is my first semi-original surname, I don't know what evaluation will be. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric submitted the paper in a step-by-step manner and then asked with a little curiosity: "Evans has produced more or less every paper you published. A sensation, I don’t know what kind of research is this illusion paper?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The main verification of human brain can produce special electromagnetic waves and cause hormone secretion, causing emotions Change and illusion." Since the paper has been submitted, there is a storm behind it to back up, Lucien has nothing to hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric was a little surprised: "Is it the predecessor of Ms. Isabella's paper? This has caused great controversy in the field of illusion, some The Arcane Master believes that she can obtain the Wizard's laurels, but most illusionists feel that the paper lacks deeper research and does not match the laurels. You may be attacked by this essay, but it also indirectly aggravates Ms. Isabella's article. The value of the paper. Perhaps you can share the laurels with her and become the second person in the last century to receive the highest honors in two different fields before the high level."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to get a laurel in this essay, but I still lack the things to decide the surname. I only hope that I can get a good evaluation result." Lucien is more self-aware, and at the same time half-jokingly, "I hope that one day I can be controversial. Take the laurel."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the appendix has two "magic human" magic as evidence, Eric said to Lucien that he will receive it the next day. Audit results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............"... When I studied photoelectric sensing, I found a strange phenomenon, no matter how much light is light below a certain frequency. Its strength does not allow the metal to generate current, which is inconsistent with the pre-derivation..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letter that Lucien read is the Arcanist "The Emperor in Control" and "The Poetry of the Goddess" Edwin? Brooke wrote to his teacher Fernando, he has noticed the abnormality of the photoelectric effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, since cathode ray and the like have not been discovered and measured, he has not noticed the essence of photocurrent for the time being, but according to this trend, it is found that electrons are only a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lucien is more and more aware of the establishment of the "Atomic Research Institute": "The magical world's arcane development process is not different from the Earth." But if it is the same, it makes people feel strange. Well, we must step up the performance to let the teacher support me to set up the atomic research institute, otherwise there will not be enough experimental conditions to complete the experiment I need!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
