			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas Magic School, a garden villa belonging to the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at a friend's house during the New Year holiday and being hangover, Rock is holding a whisper of the "Arcane" journal, both surprised and uplifting, from time to time It can be like this "drying beautiful" voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops, be late!" Rocke excitedly saw the clock hanging in the living room of his friend's house, and his body jerked up, and he was shocked. I made a big mistake myself, quickly picked up the soft hat and put it on, greeted my friend and hurried out the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school avenue, with the yellow leaves falling, creates a strange romantic atmosphere, but Rocke has no intention to appreciate, and the pace is very fast to rush to the place to rent a carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Isn't this Rock? When did the top class of the Atomic Research Institute return to school?" The astonished, sour voice suddenly came from the side. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under listening to this slightly dull and dull voice, Rock suddenly stopped and looked sideways to the other side of the avenue, only to stand under the tree and be honest. Bayat et al. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beate?" Rock's expression suddenly became excited, not paying attention to Beiyate's hostile attitude, laughing and sighing, "You read today's "Arcane"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyat stunned at the moment, when is the ridiculously ridiculous Rocke when he is so harmonious? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nothing to see? What happened?" The teacher of an electromagnetic department next to him answered doubtfully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock presses the urge to blurt out and smiles sadly: "A bright star that was remembered more than half a month ago, do you still remember? It was created and launched by the Speaker of the House! The first part of the thesis is a detailed experiment!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? This, how is this possible?" Beyat did not think Other questions are just the horror of the face. Is this an experiment that humans can complete? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other teachers next to him are the same expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock is very patiently inducing: "This fully proves the correctness of the theory of the Speaker, and strongly counters the doubts in these centuries." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Beyat agrees. Douglas's theoretical system has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and he subconsciously nodded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock suddenly laughed: "When we last discussed the Lightspeed Experiment of the Speaker, did you not negate the question based on the theoretical system of the Speaker of the Speaker?" Now? Do you believe it? Or think of other reasons?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyat raised his right hand and pointed at Rock, his fingers shaking sharply: "You!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is only a second-level arcian, and he really can't think of other theoretical explanations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, forgot to tell you that the two theories put forward in the last issue of "Arcane" and "Magic" have been refuted by the storm, one is from itself The loophole rebuttal, one is to require experimental proof, but I believe that if there is any experimental result, the proponent will definitely be attached for the first time, and if it is not available, it will prove that he has made an experimental result that is not conducive to the paper." The idea of ​​Beyat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beate is furious and unacceptable: "Then you explain the double-slit diffraction fringes with particle theory, explaining and explaining Brooke's bright spots!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is not the focus of our discussion now. Come, please give other explanations to the Lightspeed Experiment of the Speaker, to prove that the ether exists! Oh, if the ether does not exist, then the fluctuations What is the value? Right, in the "Arcane" journal, Mr. Alti尓 offered a reward of 50,000 arcane points for similar theories, so that you can play with the arcane masters who support the fluctuations! Like!" Authentic, the last two words deliberately aggravated, emphasizing just imagination. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyat feels that if the classic optical image is not supporting himself, he may have shaken it. Now he firmly insists on the bottom line: "Now Come out, and there is no representative! You still use particle theory to explain the double-slit diffraction experiments! It’s been nearly a hundred years!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyat yelled: "You are the same, refuse to face up to those classic experiments!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, Rock has been engaged in a long debate in a group of people. But both sides said that they themselves, and did not reply to the other side's questioning. It seems that the world's destruction can not make a result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s over, it’s already late!" It wasn’t until Rock found that the winter sun had sunburned himself, and then he panicked. He felt a heartache at the thought of the arcane point that would be deducted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Rock looked at Beat and others contemptuously: "Don’t go around again, have the ability to refute the Lightspeed Experiment of the Speaker, and go to receive a reward. Let me wait for you to take 50,000 arcane points for the day that Copper Fair lost me!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not advertise fluctuations without this ability ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he finished, he walked away and did not give Beiyate a chance to return. He won the debate on the essence of the war. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyat just wanted to use a classic experiment to refute Rock again, only to find that he ran without a trace, and could not vent the grievances like a flame. Burning his heart: "Damn bastard! Idiot! Fool!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar scenes also occur in many places in Aringe, but basically The orthodoxists who insisted on particle theory confronted a group of volatility supporters with an absolute number of disadvantages, but thanks to the strong proof of the speed of light experiment, they rarely took the upper hand, completely vented the usual depression, and supported the volatility. Said the Arcanist anger fire eruption but helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only good news is that because of the existence of classical optical experiments, the cognitive world built by the Arcans based on volatility has not been strongly shaken, they believe There are certainly other theories that contain etheric media that can explain Douglas's speed of light experiment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Electromagnetic Kingdom", Brooke saw a new issue Arcane Journal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched his wig's wig and sighed softly: "The teacher actually thought of this proof of thinking...it's a teacher..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned the journal to the last page, looked at Alti's "Declaration of War" carefully, then shook his head, got up and walked to the window, watching the outside twisted The magnetic field, the flowing current, the jumping arc, and the invisible electromagnetic wave, whispered to himself: "Where is the problem of the speed of light experiment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Correct but does not mean that the ether does not exist. Maybe the ether is covered with stars in a form we can't imagine now."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, thank you teacher for this experiment, let us Excluding a lot of ideas about ether, getting closer and closer to reality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which way does it exist in order to meet the results of this experiment?" Brooke fell into Contemplative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless faced with irrefutable proof, every archer has a lot of insistence on his theory than the average person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Destroy the theater". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver in pajamas? Constantine leaned back on the lounge chair, ate the grapes fed by Mrs. Florencia, and read the "Arcane" journal carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, Altiy has challenged us?" Oliver smiled at Florence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alti尓 is only a student of Douglas more than a decade later than Brooke. He is very qualified and familiar with every Arcanist and legendary magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florensa picked a fine eyebrow: "What challenge?" She was only "grabbed" by her husband when she saw Douglas's first paper. Journal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver sang two vague operas: "His reward can explain the theory of speed of light and the theory of etheric media."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
