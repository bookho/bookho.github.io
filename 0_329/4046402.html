			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bayer and a firm gaze cast on Alten, smiling slightly: "Be able to participate in a near-real trial, experience the dangers of blood and fire, it is me The pursuit of a true knight has nothing to do with the identity of the Crown Prince.” He said to the Duke of Ulrich, Ulrich, “Uncle Ulrich, since you agreed with Sophia’s request, you should not refuse Mys? I also got the consent of my father."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old duke sighed: "You young people... well, meet your wishes "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His a little loose eyelids hang down, blocking all the emotional changes in the dark blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Nuremberg smiled heartily: "Good, Bayer, the Cavaliers should be tempered by the battle! If I did not go to the Northern Province, I participated. The war against Shahran, with countless knights in the earth, in the sky, at the bottom of the river, repeated with death, perhaps I can not advance the Knights in this life."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Uncle Newlenbeck, you have always been my role model." Bayer laughed, then turned and walked toward Alten, as if casually laughing, "as mine Good friend, I hope that you can fight with me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alten’s expression immediately became excited, kneeling down, with the knight’s loyalty to the lord: "This is my glory, Your Royal Highness, I will always be your knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following his aristocratic children, all excited, with the addition of His Royal Highness With his identity and strength, the situation is once again beneficial to himself and others! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Alten is so excited, and Bayer’s just right appearance has made him see the light in the darkness of the sinking! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't think that the prince of the prince is coming, and he is still standing in Alten..." Lucien "subconsciously" "disappeared" to himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sophia face next to the skin is white and fat, without any emotional changes, Jiao Qiao laughed: "With the addition of my brother, things become interesting, Otherwise, we have two grades and five, bullying Alten. They are like bullying children. It doesn't mean anything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alten just stepped into the Grand Cavaliers Not long after, it is only three levels. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes? Little girl... Lu Xien’s belly is funny, and his real age may not be Sophia, but his psychological age is far more than that. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien’s gaze crossed Sophia’s sharp nose and looked at Claire and Relf to observe their reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw that Claire’s white teeth were unconsciously biting the red lips, his eyes flickering, and Ralph’s right hand clenched into a fist and reached his mouth. Their looks were slightly awkward, and it was clear that the emergence of the princess and the prince made them doubt again about their hopes of winning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressions and actions of the other heir candidates are similar. Suddenly, a 17-year-old boy stood up and said: "Uncle Duke, I asked Exit."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well?" Ulrich looked at him with a stern look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This young boy is frustrated: "They are too strong, I don't have any hope of winning, I still don't accept the blow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s very wise." It’s talking about Du Da, who is proud of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of Ulrich did not say much, the concession is not necessarily weak, and sometimes it is still smart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the beginning, all candidates except "Bolaq", Alten, Claire and Ralph all withdrew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness, your momentum will overwhelm them completely." Andris seems to be blushing and pleading. "You are the most in this generation of knights." One of the talents."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of the gods family is a "blazing angel". Different members of the blazing angels often have different abilities and tend to be melee. Some prefer to cast spells, and some have both. For example, Rudolf II is the balance of the "king of angels" blood, Sophia is the "angel of the wind" purely cast, Bayer is biased towards melee "The Angel of Justice." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he was frank, not inferior and shy, but rather a little bit motivated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe Princess Natasha is the queen of the empire." Andris smiled with a pun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Mo licked his chin and looked at them with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My brother’s dream will never be realized. The church cannot allow the Vaurit Principal to return to the arms of the empire, knowing that the Princess is already a Violet woman. Count," Sophia whispered with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deni combed his forehead hair: "That's not necessarily, love sometimes makes people do the most stupid things, if the Empire and the Principality are The attitude is firm and the church can't get in. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It depends on the charm of my brother." Sophia chuckled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charm of your brother is almost hopeless, but you have a certain possibility, Lucien secretly swears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the time has come, the Duke of Ulcups Ulrich announced:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Underground At the beginning of the trial of the palace, the four heirs candidates who first arrived at the secret room of the ancestral oil paintings of the gorilla family, whoever wins, if no one arrives, who can persist until the end, is also a winner."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember, the underground palace is always in the midst of change. The maps you have acquired are not useful. At the same time, the places that appear after everyone goes in are not the same. Don't try to be in place. Ambush, it will delay your time."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the goal, no rules, all the means are allowed in the underground palace, but in the trial, you can not carry the followers In addition to verifying the blood, it is also to prevent someone from deforming the items used by the Knights of the Knights, and to completely turn the trials into one side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eccentric stone door behind Ulrich slowly darkened, like the mouth of a horrible monster, and Alten first stood in front of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Nuremberg took out a gorse pin and ran straight to his back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s gaze is slightly condensed, his eyes drooping, understand that this is verifying the blood, can the deformed mask pass them? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drop of shimmering blood condensed in the needle of the gorse pin, and then quickly absorbed by it, no trace of blood stains. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Nuremberg gently beheaded: "Go in, Alten."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alten When I walked to the edge of the dark door, I suddenly looked back at Lucien. My eyes were faintly provocative. The five fingers of the right hand were gripped in turn, and the fists were raised. Then, after the reaction of Lucien, the big step disappeared. In the dark. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, it’s the turn of Wayne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing out his left hand calmly, trying to relax his heartbeat and muscles, watching Nurembeck pull the pin into his blood vessel and feel a little itchy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the pin left the back of his hand, Lucien’s spirit immediately tightened, and he was ready to explode after being exposed, and to prepare for Sophia or to escape. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drop of blood seems to have shrunk countless times of silver moon, faintly splintered out, and then shaken a few times in the needle, shaking the heart of Lucien almost stopped beating . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a brief shake, the blood is absorbed by the pins in a strange way, and there is no trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bolak, go in, your weapons and armor?" Earl Nurembe laughed curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pointed to his storage bag and replied respectfully: "All in it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding that he used the extraordinary item as his own card, Nurembeke no longer asked, let him go to the dark door, and the expression of Ralph and Claire at the rear of the team changed slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
