			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning after the rain is exceptionally fresh, the sun is not too blazing, bright and pure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A specially selected dragon scale horse shimmers with a silver-gray glow, carrying a knight who stands tall and crosses the street, and the horseshoes are lifted up and down. It is as elegant as a dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind them, Natasha wore a golden crown, holding the sword of the country, the sword of truth, sitting and accepting the worship of the subjects. There are nine dukes gathered in the back, followed by nobles of all sizes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the Nexus Palace, the nobles dispersed and went to the palace where the House is located, waiting for Her Majesty to host her first aristocratic meeting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha calmly returns to the Queen's Palace, opens the divine array, shields the outer part of Nexus Palace from snooping on the core, then in Camille and two With the help of a maid, take off the body armor, put on a black court dress, and wear the Hoffenberger's badge and a white paper flower on the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After using the eyes to signal the two maids to leave first, Natasha emerged with a little exhaustion: "The pressure is really big, I don't know who is the enemy who is the friend who can The supporters who fight for it, compared with the familiar Vaoli, are too strange and too depressed here. When they are outside, when they don’t open the magical array, they don’t even dare to say anything in the heart. Heart 'Kotonia' is responsible for the security of the outer periphery of Nexus Palace and the entire Rantat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of the words, she does not trust Ketoni Ya. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, you don't have to inherit the throne. Holm's situation is many times more complicated than Vaolirit, and you are an outsider, still lacking The actual support is easy to get involved in conspiracy and rebellion, and it is easy to stand in the wrong position and break into the abyss.” The calm Qing’s Camille rarely said so many words, with soft kindness in his eyes, “Whether it is biased towards magic Parliament, or the church, or balance on both sides, will bring you a lot of trouble."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled a bit: "I know, even if I feel Regardless of the existence of Hathaway's mother-in-law and many members of the Holm royal family, the United Church can suppress the Magic Council, and it may not be able to counter the Parliament. Their strength has expanded too fast. To contain them, not only the Holm Kingdom, but also the Holm Kingdom. To the union of Burriana, Colette and Calais, and will face the opposition and rebellion of the enlightened aristocracy, and even cause the division of the kingdom, into serious civil strife, and make Holm ruin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If you tend to balance, the church will definitely urge you, and I must also take care of the Violet family, taking care of the father, who are in the strongest place in the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You Knowing so clearly, why do you have to make unwise choices?" Camille slightly blamed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha shook her head and said with perseverance: "What reason to evade? If it directly indicates that you are not willing to assist the church, it is a serious 'abandonment of faith'. Will be punished by the holy city of Lance, the Violet family will also be weakened by the dark, so I heard this news, in addition to the inner feelings of the surging, really do not want to leave the father, but also used this excuse to evade Thoughts, maybe, I will go to Holm in the future, but it is not now, but my father suggested me to come and let me know the regrets of my mother."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Since I can't find a reason to evade, I also have the blood of the Hoffenberg family. Then I shoulder the responsibility of maintaining the Kingdom of Holm. I don't want to see the civil war in Holm, changing the hometown of my mother's love." In hell, well, I came with this idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Moreover, I am a devout believer, the patriarch of the Hoffenberg family, The patriarch of the Violet family, the church should be in a certain van Respect my wishes, as before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natasha, that was before, if the situation in the Holm Kingdom reached a critical moment, how the church May consider your wishes, and will only ask you to make sacrifices for the Lord.” Camille felt that Natasha’s explanation was good, but the latter statement seemed to be somewhat written. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled and said firmly: "If I completely violate my wishes, I would rather sacrifice myself. The church cannot interfere with the kingdom a few hundred years ago. The agreement made by the two sides before the Lord, if the church violates, they are heretics and are the object of hostility of all nobles. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, a lot of things are still unknown, I can't confirm my thoughts for the time being." Natasha was asked a little confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camille looked at her seriously: "Try to figure out as soon as possible, whether you are biased towards the Magic Council, the Church, or maintain balance, make up your mind as soon as possible So many things can be arranged as early as possible and circumvented as soon as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She refers to the affairs of the Vaolirit Principality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand that the concept of governing the country will be determined as soon as possible so that a decree can be enacted in a planned manner to gradually eliminate opponents, but this requires me to the Kingdom of Holm. The situation has a deeper understanding. The only thing that can be affirmed now is that the most enlightened aristocrats are absolutely unwilling to be completely eliminated. The most conservative aristocrats will not want to return to the situation of the royal power hundreds of years ago, huh, Gordonnay. Except for the complete dedication to the church, I plan to maintain balance for this period of time." Natasha agreed to nod. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, she turned to look in the mirror and looked at the purple-haired woman in a black court dress and touched the Hoffenberg family badge on her chest. He said to himself: "Before this, what needs to be clarified is my belief. What does the Lord mean in my heart? What is the relationship between the church and the Lord? Only by recognizing yourself can you decide the future. The plan can be upgraded to the eighth level, picking up the sword of truth, no longer facing the weak who is not capable of resisting the legend, and what the cardinal of Sirde is thinking, what he wants, it is hard to see..."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that shakes the faith, she did not tell the Grand Duke, nor did she tell Camille, except Lucian knows that only Fernando and Hathaway summoned the paradise by Francis submitted by Lucien The mountain projection event guessed a bit, and the same was true for Thrad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you should go to the House of Nobles." Camille opened the door to the palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha once again looked at the mirror and saw the implied sorrow and sorrow in the bright-haired woman inside, suddenly thought: "Go to Huo Erm, who became the queen, couldn’t go to Holm’s Royal Magic Tower to visit Hathaway’s mother-in-law, nor could he go to Aalto to see his unique magic tower and the often mentioned atomic research institute. Any one of my actions would be The aristocrats who have the heart have a deep meaning. If they do the above two things, they will undoubtedly symbolize the complete reversal of the Magic Council."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They It is also impossible to see me through the Lord Ktonik... The distance in space is close, and the distance is actually farther away."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hope him The new encryption algorithm will keep our communication from being cracked..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp In the hall of the Noble House, Natasha stood on the podium and accepted the pilgrimage of the nobility, and then succinctly said:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, I declare two things. First, prepare for the funeral of my grandfather and aunt, and mourn for one month. During this period, all meetings of the House of Lords are suspended. There is no need. The policy of issuing a decree or implementation is directly addressed to me."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King and the Crown Prince both call the Lord, Natasha’s request is normal, so Lake Sis and others did not comment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Natasha continued: "Second, given that I don’t know much about the kingdom, it’s also based on the decree issued by my grandfather and grandfather. Confidence, within six months, unless there is a sudden and no precedent, I will not approve any proposal to change the current laws, policies, and ministerial duties. You will continue to maintain the prosperity of the kingdom as before."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" The surprises of the nobility came one after another. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rex with a white hairband stood up and said: "The Queen, there are many hidden problems in the current kingdom, and we need to deal with it in time. Wouldn't it be too extreme to disapprove any proposal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before I came, the kingdom was always in the hands of these decrees, policies, and the efforts of ministers. The situation of prosperity and development, maintaining a peaceful situation, is it just because I came, they are not applicable? In just six months, they will change from beneficial things to very harmful things?" Natasha The back is straight and the atmosphere is authentic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
