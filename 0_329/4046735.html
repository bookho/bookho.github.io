			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mafario looked at Lanhill and said nothing, turning to Lucien, Natasha and Atlante: " I am very sorry about this matter, Ferragaund put his own preferences above the life and death of the entire Elf, and I do not agree with him. Human beings are undoubtedly part of nature."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not anger the natural hate faction, nor did he take things through, but expressed his opinions and apologies very well, letting Lucien and others understand the fee. Lagunde does not represent all elves. On the contrary, he is a minority, otherwise there will be no such thing as asking for help from the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be able to have one less hateful emperor beside it, I think our investigation will be smoother." Lucien accepted Malfurion's apology. , smile without a grace and answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Revenge Hunter" Lan Hill has a pair of silver-white eyes, which are not shocking, and the voice is like singing: "Thank you for not minding Farragund." The rudeness, I will take you to see Her Majesty the Queen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not deliberately provoke the "natural hatred" and the "natural balance" of the representative of Malfurion The faction of the faction has nothing to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his leadership, Lucien three people crossed the azure-like lake and flew toward the trunk of the trunk to form a forest of elves. In the semi-empty position, the dense trunk twisted to form a tree house that was as refined as an art. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the tree house, dotted with yellow and white flowers, exudes a heart-rending fragrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a feeling of spiritual clarity here, I feel that my creative inspiration is constantly emerging..." Natasha sincerely praises the natural beauty "When the night is over, the silver moon shines on the Elf Lake, and the layers of the sun are shining. It will be the true sight of your "Moonlight"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lu Xien smiled and nodded: "In such an environment, the whole heart calms down. If you like it, we can settle here."<br /><br />&nbsp Natasha said with a smile: "If I stay for two or three weeks, my musician's soul will gradually disappear, and the knight and vulgar side will emerge. Although it is very good, it will live for a long time." Not suitable for my family name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too late... Lucien himself is joking, more than a "natural residence", full of arcane discussions and disputes Allinge is more suitable for himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malfurion said next to him: "Although we are trying to keep up with the news of the dramatic changes in Stroop, the people in the sea seem to have noticed what, In a row, the disputes were provoked, so Intis went to the endless sea to help Guardian defense, while Celine and Loder guarded the abyss gap on the other side of the forest."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, there are only Her Majesty and three of us here."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gedard is the legendary Druid of the Sea Elf family, because of the long life, There is also a second-order level under the accumulation, and Intis is the legend of the Moon Elf, the "Moon of the Moon", and like Lanhill, he is advanced by his own talent, because he is only a young man, he has just been promoted for less than one hundred years. It is still a legendary first. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selene and Loder are two other members of the Druid Presbyterian Church. The former is the Tree Fairy, the "Guardian of the Green", the legendary second-order, after The person is human, "the hand of balance", the legendary first order. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Great Elder, it doesn't matter, wait for the check of the 'elf tree' and the fallen and demonized elves, we will go to the abyss gap as soon as possible, to Selen and Loder Consultation." Lucien just stepped on the trunk before the tree house, and felt the deep and heavy pulse of life on the sole of the foot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha moved his right foot and seemed to be carefully sensing the condition of the "elf tree". Atlante also opened his eyes and the pupils were uncertain. The light flickers and changes, thoughtfully looking around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the "vengeful hunter" Lan Hill, Lucian, Natasha and Atlante passed through a tree house, along A naturally formed gap penetrates the interior of the "elf tree." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding colors gradually change from brownish green to dark green, and when it reaches the deepest part, there is a little white and holy light in the light green, as if it contains The purest and most fundamental force of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The heart of nature..." Lucien and Natasha spoke at the same time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most fundamental thing of the elves, and it is the core of the "elf tree". As long as there is a "natural heart", after they move to other places, they will Can re-create the "elf tree" to form a puzzle, initially a total of five "natural heart", but as time goes by, two become the main material of the legendary peak items, two missing, only this The last glory of the elf remains in the Trump Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, this is also the most powerful "heart of nature", after semi-integration with it, Elf Queen Aglesia broke through the limits and became the legendary peak This is why the Elf family has always maintained a legendary peak - of course, it must be the legendary third-order powerhouse and semi-integration to advance to the peak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Heart of Nature", standing with a vague blond figure, she is trying to exclude those black spots, but I don’t know why The strength of her legendary peak has also progressed to the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks to the two representatives for coming to the parliament for assistance." The appearance of the blonde figure gradually became clear, and the pure and beautiful beauty was so mature and majestic that it was difficult to draw and look hard. Like Elsett's sister, not her mother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is a taste..." "Gentleman" is not a sigh, but Nathissa, but she soon wakes up, in the heart In the connection, Lu Xien smiled and said, "Reassured, I just appreciate it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mafario introduced Lucien to Agger Leia, she nodded gently: "I also asked the two to investigate as soon as possible, no matter what the final result, the elves will send a thank you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not say I understand too much, I seem to want to wait until things are over before deciding what it is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien came here this time, the main purpose is to maintain allies, the private purpose is to exchange, and will not take the things of the elves, so there is no such thing The opportunity is to be embarrassed, but to the Agraia Road wearing a long green dress: "Her Majesty, then we began to check."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I can Maintaining the spirit tree is not continued to be polluted and slowly cleared. It is worrying that as the gap expands, the abyss will come directly, and it will be troublesome.” Agleia expressed her thoughts, and she was most worried about the situation of the abyss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien went to the "Natural Heart" and made a hard and mysterious voice in his mouth: "Mirror of Destiny." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding environment has been abruptly dimmed a lot, and then there are countless light spots like fireflies in this bleak, condensed in front of Lucien, forming A mirror full of mysterious patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original "Museum of Destiny" by Maskillin and MacLeod was based on this legendary magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mirror is unclear, but with the crystal ball of Lucien’s left hand flying in, suddenly like a huge stone falling into the middle of the lake, a layer of ripples Come, there are black spots in it, and it is getting bigger and bigger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the black spots squirmed and stunned, seemingly containing all the chaos and killings in the world, with strong hatred, wanting Destroy everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slamming mirror, like a real mirror broken, makes a crisp sound, re-inflated to the fluttering firefly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slightly frowns, seems to grasp something, so continue to perform other magic checks, and Atlante also uses his own magic to identify. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Lucien stopped and said to Natasha: "Give a black spot to the sword, don't break the life of 'Nature Heart' "甬"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not say that this is an exercise for your fine control, otherwise Agrea, Malfurion’s face is definitely not It will look good. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Natasha can understand the meaning of Lucien, suddenly narrowed his eyes, like a cheetah ready to go, and then took out the sword of truth The whole body is integrated into Jianguang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has seen Lucien holding the "monthly timepiece" in her right hand, knowing that if she has a slight problem, he will stop it with "advanced time stop". Avoid yourself hurting the "heart of nature." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
