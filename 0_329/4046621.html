			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas saw several Arcanists and legendary magicians have gathered here, so he asked with concern: "Do you have any of these days? What? I think he exposed the secret means to block me in the semi-position. There is no reason. Did he tamper with my dialogue with him to confuse people or deceive the members of the highest panel?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the question from the Speaker, Lucien couldn’t help but praise him. Even if he was locked in the halfway, he could still reason most of the things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary magician present is the oldest with Fernando's qualifications, the most unscrupulous, the voice is loud and clear: "Douglas, you are confused about the nature of gravity, the source and the initial rotation. The driving force, can not lose confidence to find a supreme existence to explain everything? There are 100,000 why not terrible, terrible is why even can not ask, I believe that a god can solve everything, I am satisfied, completely Losing the pride of being a smart creature. This church used part of your conversation to make the entire parliamentary arcane master almost lose confidence."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas slightly frowns "Is Benedict III using the method of concealing the latter half to confuse people?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I admit, when I am confused and confused, I can’t see it. When I move forward, but whenever I return to reality, I find that there are so many reasons why I have not solved it. I am full of motivation, and the supremacy is not the same as the god of truth, but also the world. The real synonymous. The starry sky is so vast, boundless, under the backdrop of it, the whole world is so small, how can I believe in a god who robs believers and resources in such a small place?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando laughed: "This is the Douglas I know, and I will say that you will not fall to believe in the truth."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Next to Helen quietly patted his cheek and vomited, Brooke, Hathaway and Oliver's expression more or less revealing ease and joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the upswing of an organization, many contradictions will be covered up by this booming trend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas has no nonsense other things, directly: "The entire parliament is affected? Is it through the sky radio station? I will clarify things and put Benedict III The despicable means is announced to everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know if the one-and-a-half-day delay will cause the lie to ferment to the point where it can’t be cleaned up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do not have to be so anxious, the impact has been eliminated, do you still talk about what happened?" Fernando eagerly wondered what was going on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looked at the crowd in disbelief: "Removed? Fernando, aren't you saying that the Rossist of the entire parliament has lost confidence?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This description can be quite serious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook has been listening quietly to the teacher because of his relationship with the teacher. He didn’t talk, Hathaway could not speak without talking, Helen was because of his heart. Sorry to speak, only Oliver smiled and took the message: "Lord the Speaker, lost confidence because the archaeologists see you, the proponents of gravity theory are confused about the nature and source of gravity, so as to seek philosophy. And the sustenance of theology, this has cast doubt on its own path, and when someone explains the essence of gravity, it has stirred up the hearts of the people, and naturally it has faded and lost."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is fine." Douglas did not respond first, and suddenly turned to the side: "Wait a minute, what did Oliver say? Someone explained the nature of gravity?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked back at the "real mystery" and asked inquiringly: "I was blocked in the semi-planet for a day and a half? Inconsistent? Actually has passed Years?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no sign that explained the nature of gravity before, so the news made him very shocked, wondering if the time flow effect caused by the blockade Otherwise, how could this kind of thing suddenly pop up in a day and a half? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really a day and a half, but it’s Lucian Evans’s efforts for several years. He proposed a theoretically supported explanation of the nature of gravity, theoretical derivation. The value is perfectly in line with the observations of the excess precession of the morning star near the point and the adjustment of the artificial planet at a higher altitude than the ground time." Oliver laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, he seems to have forgotten anything he wanted to do before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen handed over the papers he had to come to and the contents of the book from Lucien to Douglas: "His Lord, give."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the paper, Douglas directly looked at it, calm and calm expression disappeared, his eyes filled with concentration, surrounded by large shadows, and directly built auxiliary calculations Array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretches his hand from time to time to scratch his head, making the neat white hair very messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding his urgency about this issue, he was impatient as Fernando did not bother him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Douglas was half confused and half-heartedly pulling his bow tie: "Probably the meaning I understand, the essence of gravity is caused by quality. Bending time and space, geometric language I have also seen from the journal Nature, can the process of derivation be reasonable?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the number one in mathematics is only one In the case of the journal Nature, Douglas has a deeper grasp of many new methods such as tensor analysis, but in a short time, he can't understand general relativity. Fernando replied: "At least neither I nor Bergner found a loophole in mathematical derivation, but the mathematical methods used in some places in Lucian are cumbersome and cumbersome. Not concise."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Space-time bending...quality...energy-momentum tensor...the perturbation of space-time curvature is transmitted in the form of waves..." Douglas murmured Speaking of the content of the paper, I fell into the state of 100,000. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, Helen and others kept complete silence, did not disturb the Speaker of the Speaker. After a long time, Douglas suddenly woke up and took a deep breath. A little excitement and fanaticism on his face converge, he went to Lucien and patted him on the shoulder: "I don't dare to say that your theory is correct now, but you have undoubtedly put forward a genius idea that transcends the times. And in line with all observations, let us have a deeper thought on the nature of gravity. The greatest achievement of the Magic Council in the past ten years is that you have joined, I regret that I did not insist on my own ideas and made Fernando yours. Teacher."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All this is based on the laydown of the Speaker of the House of Representatives." Lucien smiled and replied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas shook his head: "If it is a special theory of relativity, it may not be long before Oliver, I or anyone else can do it, but general relativity is definitely beyond the current The basics of arcane, relying on the treasures of personal genius souls, without you, it will take decades, or even hundreds of years, to be completed in the exploration of a generation of Arcanists."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On a private level, I am very grateful to you. I seem to have found my way to promote the gods. When I understand it, I confirm the strict surname it derives, and then solve the part. Solution, maybe you can touch the door of the gods with one hand, and it will take another step to take this step afterwards. It is another thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "So, Douglas, when you confirm the paper, come to help Lucien to hold the magical source ceremony." Fernando interjected, he has invited the four Arcanists who are present, Brooke, Hathaway, Oliver, Helen. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas has never been more surprised than it was today, and looked at Fernando and Lucien a little dazed: "You said, Lucien already "Nine rings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you think? This kind of change in the achievements of the times, as well as the discovery of neutrons, the feedback of the real world is very rich." Fernando Although I am praising myself, I am very happy to see others as amazed at the achievements of my students. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled and shook his head: "Lu Xien, if advanced, you will be the youngest legendary magician in the history of magic. Let's wait a minute. Let's start the ceremony. Even if it is confirmed that there is a big mistake in this paper, the extra cost of the magical ritual is also borne by me. It is a private thank you to Lucien for quelling the impact of this incident."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the situation of Franks and Benedict III?" Fernando asked again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas probably talked about it, and finally wondered: "Franks is the mage who survived the ancient magical empire, hated the truth of the gods, and often From time to time, I did something in the church, so I never suspected that he would surrender to the church before, and there was no light when he died."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
