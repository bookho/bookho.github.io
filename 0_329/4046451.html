There is nothing to avoid, so I smiled and said, "Oh, a package plan? Lucien, have you been thinking for a long time?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp He created a magical parliament and built a theoretical system that influenced the magicians of generations, and even the hostiles such as the pope, the pope, the clergy, the vampires, etc., regardless of IQ or wisdom, belonged to the entire world. In the presence of the top three, so even if the "sexuality" of Lucien is not as well understood as the storm master, it is also possible to guess the purpose of Lucien's own work to hide his own purpose. [This article comes from]<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s face is already quite thick, and I don’t care if the two arcane masters see it carefully and smile slightly: “ The first question is about satellite communications. According to the data in the past papers of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, I have two options for establishing a communication field covering the entire continent and the ocean. One is that the orbital plane includes the north sky. And the artificial planet of the endless sea and south sea ice, at least two, the other is the synchronous orbiting planet over the right ascension..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The arcane master who has a deep research on the astrological field, so Lucien said it is not detailed, just to show his own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The best solution is to combine the two, and in order to ensure the quality of the communication, the quantity is best far above the minimum standard, of course, given the expensive materials of the artificial planet The energy consumption of space jump is very large. We can only make a long-term plan step by step. Oh, I suggest to name it 'Constellation Creation Plan.' Plan to form different constellations with artificial planets around the world.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the same time, we'd better set up a company to charge each magician using the communications planet a fee to cover the cost of refining and 'launching'. Specific communication-type alchemy items are either purchased by the company or paid for by the company after the royalties are paid."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is the authority in the field of electromagnetics. After listening to it, he frowned slightly: "This is not fundamentally different from the previous Douglas speaker's concerns. When such artificial planets cover the whole continent, they need complete or even higher standards of electromagnetic communication to make the signal clear. The user is limited to the magicians of the five rings and above, and the number only accounts for a small part of the entire magician group. After all, the middle and low-level resources are used very little."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp "Therefore, the charging standard can be a little more expensive, and the open part of the less important communication planet is used by the wealthy aristocrats. They need a similar product in the need of extravagant life. There is also enough financial burden. Lucien did not disclose the follow-up "magic base station" plan. Or wait until the communication satellite has a certain scale before putting it on the agenda. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planet in the sky is hard to hit. The base stations on the ground may not be the only ones. They can only wait for the aristocrats to like this simple communication method, and then they will consciously maintain the "magic base station". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien continued: "And the communication needs of the middle and lower level magicians. I have constructed a new one by simplifying the teacher's 'electromagnetic communication' The second ring magic 'electromagnetic file technique'. Although the scope is limited, and there is no way to talk directly, it can only be used like a file transfer in the tower, enough for the middle and low-level magicians to communicate."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Electromagnetic file technology" is a radiotelegram, and a very small range of walkie-talkies because of the secondary mind connection, does not have much value, can only be used as a substitute in special circumstances, So Lucien didn't take the time to create this magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Second Ring Magic, most of the nobles with titles, territories, and manors can be used." Norman gently decapitated, apparently discovered this magic The popularity of its alchemy items is possible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This was originally promoted as one of the popular items." Unconsciously, Lucien was infected with Arthur’s commercial tone, "In addition, I have been inspired by the recent erection of wires. The reason why the teacher's 'electromagnetic communication' requirements are high is that it is directly transmitted by electromagnetic waves in the air. It is easy to encounter various complicated environments and terrains, and can only improve the intensity of the transmitted signals. Filter the scale of the magical array to make up for the loss."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you can set up the route to every city, every manor, every house, I think this is an alchemy item that can be popularized to the public. The trouble is that the investment in the early stage is huge and the church is easy to destroy."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas's five fingers in the right hand are bent: "To achieve your goal, the erection of lines and wires is a long-term plan, at least for ten years. In order to achieve initial success in the Kingdom of Holm, let alone countries such as Buriana and the country opposite the Storm Straits."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But so long In time, with the speed of our development and the speed of change of the aristocracy, we should be able to completely suppress the power of the church in the Kingdom of Holm. In this way, perhaps ten years later, the picture you sketched will be The prosperous places such as Rentat and Pefors have been roughly presented, and an ordinary person can also communicate with distant friends through alchemy items."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he He smiled awkwardly: "You The plan is very hierarchical. The artificial communication planet is aimed at the five rings and above magicians, big nobility, big businessmen, 'electromagnetic file technology' for middle and low-level magicians, small and medium-sized aristocrats, wealthy businessmen, line communication plans for magic apprentices, and broken Aristocrats and ordinary citizens cover almost all classes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, the last line plan can be further divided into two levels, one is to talk directly through the line One is to transmit files like 'electromagnetic file technology', the latter has lower requirements for the terminal magic array. And we can temporarily set up special service organizations only in different areas of the city, so that the needers can come to their own door, so Come, you don't need to spread to most families to start planning.” Lucien talked and seemed to plan the future magic world according to the earth's vision in his mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives him a way to change the world. Let it control the thrill of development based on its own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, waiting for the magic and alchemy items to reach the vast majority of ordinary people, the church's belief base will be shaken like never before, well. We must prevent it. Counterattack." Douglas nodded with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;呃, the Speaker of the House, the teacher, they also noticed the church’s request to spread the faith? Lucien once again realized that this world is not only a smart person, so he has come up with another plan: "I recently researched a new, cheap alchemy item. It can accept electromagnetic signals in a certain frequency band and transform For the sound, although there is no peer-to-peer communication function, it is enough to change the life of ordinary people!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien said that the magic of the ore radio Variants, belonging to the first-class alchemy items, but after large-scale, streamlined production, the cost can be reduced to the level of apprenticeship, and the public can afford to save for several years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Life has changed?" For the principles, effects, and limitations, Lucien said it was not detailed enough, but Fernando knew it as soon as he heard it. More concerned about the description of life changes? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s micro-band laughed with a bad taste: “We can set up an electromagnetic program agency to spread signals to the country on the Strait of the Storm at a specific frequency. The program can be played symphony, piano, opera, or storytelling, but also the popularity of basic knowledge of arcane and magic. And the disclosure of church black history..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the words of Lucien, Luciana had a slightly open mouth. I was shocked and stunned: "This is the foundation of the church. They will be crazy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So the time period and frequency band should be selected, and the program It must be interesting and guaranteed to attract people's interest, and as long as they have interest, they will voluntarily keep secret and gradually be transformed. Of course, we must choose the scope to ensure that even if someone is swindled, we also have The ability to interfere does not allow him to get on the fire." Lucian answered with a serious expression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas sighed softly: "Very good, this electromagnetic program is named by you." He and Fernando and others were keenly aware of this. The value of the plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, call the voice of mystery." Lucien would not say that he had already thought about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are several alchemy items and communication plans that you propose are integrated into one company. We acquire shares according to our own contributions and investments. You as an advocate, alchemy The inventor of the item will be able to hold a 25 percent stake." Fernando hammered it, seemingly fair, but made Lucien a big bargain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
