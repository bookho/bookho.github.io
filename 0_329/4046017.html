			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuously rejected by three tailor-made shops that look a bit graded, Lucien is very depressed, even if they start with black yarn, those tailors They still refused to believe that they were unwilling to identify what it was, and they were full of vigilance against the stranger of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This market area is very large, there are more than a dozen streets in the horizontal and vertical, people come and go, often see dwarves, elves and other aliens, very prosperous, so Lucien quickly found an elegant and clean tailor shop at the end of a street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the counter is a fifteen-year-old blond boy with a smile and a green smile: "Master is making clothes behind, my name is Bans. Special, what do you need?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can you help me see this black gauze?" Lucien learned the lesson and took it back to black. Asked the yarn. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banster thought that Lucien wanted to pick a similar black gauze and took it without doubt. He rubbed his fingers and looked at the sun. The more surprised: "Guest, this is the 'black nightingale' of the Holm kingdom, only the black yarn that the real aristocrats can afford, where did you get it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ; &nbsp;He, like other tailors, showed guard and fear, and Lucien, wearing a worn linen blouse, could not afford to buy a "black nightingale", even many rich men could not afford it. The origin is very suspicious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sees everyone is the same reaction, simply lowering the voice: "Reassured, will never bring you trouble."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes?" From the back of the store, a man in his thirties with a thin face, he is the owner of this tailor shop, Maddale, before Banst. Surprised, did not control the sound, disturbed him, so when he came out to view, just heard the explanation of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn’t go straight to me? Lucien saw that there was finally a good interaction, and couldn’t help but raise expectations and a little excitement: "I swear in the name of the Lord, and, you see, it has broken holes, no noble lady, The lady will care about it. As long as you turn it into a lace and a streamer of the skirt, no one will ever know what it is."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McDol from Banster took the black yarn in his hand and looked at it carefully. After a moment of silence, he calmly said: "How much do you want?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luxi En was excited, clenched his fist and almost waved, but the experience of the red-eyed mouse kept Lucien calm and calm, watching Maddale smile: "I believe that you will not let me down." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McDowell stared at Lucien’s eyes for a few seconds, seeing that he was not eager, and gently said: “Forty copper, it’s only Big, there are holes, and there are not many that can be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A silver nal, a gorgeous If you have deep in the night sky like a skirt beautiful 'black Nightingale' as an embellishment, it would certainly be more perfect, more suitable for noble ladies, ladies. "Lucien forced back the excitement, in accordance with the principle of double bargain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McDowell shook his head and returned the black gauze to Lucien: "Up to fifty copper fairs, if not, you take it with you." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's a pity." Lucien took the black gauze calmly and turned to go outside the store. In fact, the heart was full of tension and contradiction. Will you stop me? Will it increase the price? Missed this store, may not find someone who is willing to buy unknown goods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One step, two steps, three steps... Lu Xien saw that he was going out of the tailor shop, and the voice behind Maddale finally sounded: "eighty Copper Fair, if it is not just a long skirt that is suitable for using black nightingale as a lace, I will never have such a high price."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make it beautiful! Lucien, who turned his back to Maddale, excitedly and excitedly waved his right fist on his chest, then turned and smiled flatly: "As you wish."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eightty squeaky copper coins were packed in Lucien’s pockets, making them bulging, very cumbersome, but Lucien felt they couldn’t tell. lovely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's my pleasure." Lucien was in a good mood, so he smiled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From McDowell’s tailor shop, Lucien found that the sky was so blue, the sun was so bright, the air was so fresh, everything was So beautiful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighteen copper fairs said that there are not many, saying that there are not many, except that Lu Xi’en is close to five Yinnar, and it also proves Lucien’s method of collecting broken money and making money works. For Lucien, this is the most important thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brian, you are finally back, my brother, he Already at home, my mother asked me to invite you to dinner."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Sien went to his house not far, and saw Ai Wen standing at his doorstep. And Ai Wen also found Lucien at about the same time, shouting with joy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The eldest son of Eliza's eldest son, John? The young man who has become a trainee knight?" Lucien recalled about Evan's brother. Then I laughed at Ai Wen: "Let's wait, I wipe the sweat." The ninety-two copper fairs on the body can't let Ai Wen see it. God knows if he will say it out loud, wait for himself to make up. After the tuition of five silver coins is enough, there is not much problem. Lucien believes that he will never do this forever. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Wen smiled and replied: "Okay, Lucien Big Brother. Right, my brother brought back a piece of wild beef, they were trained by the Cavaliers some time ago. In the wild hunting, Sir Wien gave it to everyone."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can finally eat potato stewed beef, since my brother was Sir Wien After picking up and going to the manor training, I have only eaten less than 20 times in the past two years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dirty face is not pressed Aspire to live and mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joer is a good kind of street performer, although the income is good or bad, but it is much better than the people who are hard-working and hard-working, plus Ai Lisa has been helping the textile guild to do the chores of washing clothes, so their family’s income is actually close to the level of civilians, but before the exercise of John, there was very little food, which has been very difficult, even Occasionally, Ivans is helping. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When John was successfully picked up by Sir Wien, after two people were worried, Eliza began to plan for Ai Wen’s future life, and the result turned out to be more than before. It’s a lot worse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About this point, Lucien, who doesn’t know much about the world, doesn’t feel strange, but thinks that the poor can eat beef once a month, which is very good. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hide the copper fair, wipe the sweat, and Lucien followed Ai Wen to the home of Eliza. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside the home of Eliza, there was a group of familiar neighbors of Lucien who discussed it enthusiastically:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I heard that Little John has become the official knight attendant of Sir Wien?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alice said she said, she would not lie ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Under the 19-year-old official knight attendant, Little John may indeed be able to stimulate blood and gain grace and become a true knight." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, you can't call John anymore, you have to call John, John."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you can't scream, the official knight attendant, but qualified to become a city guard officer!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joel and Eliza I am so lucky, I have a good voice in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at Ai Wen doubtfully, Ai Wen nodded heavily, a pair of glory Look like. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the house, Lucien saw a blond-eyed young man standing up from his chair and inheriting Joel’s young John. It is tall and handsome, but the most direct impression of Lucien is his calm and restrained temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gray knight suit, his body is very slender, and to Lucien, it is a mature brother's attitude, although only one or two years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and replied: "There was no serious illness, and Eliza was too worried, so it was a bit nervous."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai Wen is acquainted with the following: "Yes, that is, Mom does not believe me at all."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John smiles I patted Ai Wen’s head: “Go wash your face and prepare for dinner.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Elvin left, John smiled softly and gestured Sean sat down: "Why, I haven't seen it for a long time, and become rusty? Lucien, we are good friends who grew up together."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a bit Not adapted, well, I didn’t expect you to change so much.” Lucien found the reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John nodded in a serious position: "Knight training is not just physical training, but also behavioral, spiritual training, very hard, and very rewarding. Big."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After chatting a few words about John training in the Knights of Wien Knights, Alisa greeted Lucien for dinner. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only potato goulash and grilled fish on the dinner table, but Lucien, who ate a day of dark bread, felt so delicious, almost ate with his tongue, Joel Because John became a happy event for the official knight attendant, he was allowed to make an exception by Eliza, eating beef and drinking ale with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole dinner, Alice is happy, always talking, taking care of food or wine Joel, Lucien, Avon Only occasionally responding to her a few words, she was very satisfied, and John followed the Knights Code and was silent when eating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"嗝~" In the long fullness of Avon, the dinner is over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John smiled and shook his head: "Avon, excessive satiety, is bad for the body, don't do this in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he turned to look at Lucien: "Lusien, have you thought about what to do in the future?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For This question, whether it is Joel or Eliza, is a serious look at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien cautiously replied: "There is no certain goal, but I don't want to be like this now."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, dissatisfaction with life is the power of progress." John nodded his head. "The bakery and winery in Sir Wien's Manor, who recently lacked manpower, wanted to recruit several apprentices, but In the next ten years, I have to live in the manor. Lucien, think about it, wait for me to come back after the week, and tell me the answer."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Become the official knight attendant After that, John had the ability to change the life of his family and friends. Although it was meager, it was very important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this world, the myth of seven days is also circulated, so every seven days, one week, that is, one week. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Okay, John." Lucien just earned the first pot of gold in his life, and he had a longer-term and beautiful plan for the future. Selling for ten years, but the direct rejection is too strange, not in line with his current state of life, so prepare for a few days until next week and then refuse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John stood up: "Well, since Lucine is okay, then I have to go back to Sir Wien's manor before the gate closes." Then he hugged Joel, Alisa, and Avon, and finally gave Lucien a big hug. "Unfortunately, Lucien is illiterate, or Donnie is just missing a clerk to help him." Dealing with the village courts, this is a rewarding and decent job."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am trying to learn the text." Lucien took the opportunity to speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John stunned and then laughed: "Our Lucian is very motivated, well, I will help you think about it, see if you can Find opportunities, but you may not want to be big, or it will take a long time, you have to be prepared."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
