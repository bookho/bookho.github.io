			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogant devil became Lucien, gracefully and slowly coming out of the mirror, black leather shoes shining brightly. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If even the most basic judgment based on objective facts is called arrogance, then arrogance is not a devil, but an angel." Lucien did not Instead, he looked at the "arrogant" devil in front of him with the same expression as himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrogant devil is still the disdain of the eye above the top: "Do you dare say that you don't have a look down and ridicule inside? Pride is not an emotion, it comes from Your way of thinking comes from the prejudice caused by successful experience. You say it is the devil. It is the devil. You say it is an angel. It is an angel. Therefore, it is impossible for your spells to be shielded. When you face those mistakes. When you are in the arcane theory, are you not arrogant? When you face the weak and challenge you, are you not arrogant? Admit it, there is nothing wrong with arrogance, this is the sign that the winner is different from the loser, just like... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of this, he suddenly raised his right hand and made a difficult voice in his mouth:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Forgiveness of the goddess of ice and snow!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......When you create the legendary spell of “the forgiveness of the goddess of ice and snow” that is close to absolute zero, are you not proud of it? When you use it to deal with enemies, isn’t your heart proud and proud? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is arrogance! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "arrogant" devil with an indescribable overhead view, exhibited this snow and ice legendary spell to Lucien, unique to Lucien Legendary spells are like real but arrogant Lucien! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its attack is coming, a crystal clear beam of light is bound by countless tiny rays that are hard to see with the naked eye and a dark magnetic field. Sean rushed to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road that has been guarded is like it was expected, when the "arrogant" devil raised his right hand, the back highlighted a dark and deep universe. Under the colorful planet, a huge fireball exudes horror to the extreme heat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as real as it affects the environment, and the dark red bed and brown carpet in the room immediately "gasify". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forgiveness of the Snow Goddess" broke into this "atomic universe", and under the "sun" high temperature and majestic energy storm, bound it The magnetic field and the laser were distorted and affected, so the unimaginable ultra-low temperature broke out in advance, one by one was frozen, and the dark starry sky was colder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, even when the radiance of the frozen black solidified there, the original Lu Xien disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "arrogant" devil still has a reaction in the future, and the whistling and whistling sound of the ticking suddenly sounds in his ear. Then, a "click" ends everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The palatial castle has faded all the bright colors, leaving only the monotonous and decaying gray, and the "arrogant" devil's "Lu Sien" is like A doll in an old photo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the window, Lucien’s figure emerges, his right hand holding a silver-white exquisite pocket watch, and his mouth is filled with a spell that bursts with strange waves:<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luxury big crack!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Luxury big crack!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soul slam!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three legendary spells are accompanied by "the hand of uncertainty", and the last one is Lucy One of the few legendary magics of the new school in this period, specifically used to deal with things that are not real state, such as spiritual bodies and ancient devils. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you want to come to ancient hell, you have to be well prepared. Lucien never underestimates any opponent, unless there is another purpose, the lion fights rabbit And do your best! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the three legendary spells were displayed, the feeling of time solidification was broken, and the luxurious colors such as dark red and bright yellow all returned, "old photos" The arrogant devil also screams and the effects of one spell disappear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with a bang, his body became illusory, and a black gas spurted out of the eyes, neck, ears, mouth and pores, just like a water polo was smashed by an invisible giant hammer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the "soul blow" caused the "arrogant" devil's serious injury and rigidity, Lucian certainly will not let go of the opportunity, together with the "ice goddess "Forgiveness" was played with Helen's "Silent Dark Blue". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "arrogance" of the devil's blackness and its "self" freeze, falling into a silent and cold dark blue, losing all vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road is ready to apply various seals and bring the "arrogant" devil back to study, its mouth in the dark blue suddenly evokes, revealing a strange Smile, then, screaming! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Silent Dark Blue" did not completely trap it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fireball rolls up and down, a powerful shock wave sweeps across the castle, making this valuable building like a sand sculpture on the beach, with the advent of the tide, It crashed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien flashed to the sky outside the castle, looking at the burning ruins below, considering the "arrogant" devil: <br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to simulate all the magic that includes my legendary spells, as well as all the spell effects on my body. It looks like my copy, and the monster of the 'World of the Doors' Viken Very similar, but there is no special surname that is half a step higher than me..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...no 'monthly time', so stop at 'advanced time' I can't get rid of the bondage... This shows that it can't simulate the effect of the items on my body?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...can't change state in my own way, obviously This level of the world's essence is no longer accessible and copied by ancient devils. It can only be carried out in a similar form to its ancient devil, so it will not be able to escape the 'silent dark blue'..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien analyzes the situation of the "arrogant" devil, the ruins and the surrounding wilderness He laughed loudly: "It's useless, you can't kill me, because, I am you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to face up to myself as an arrogant performance!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughter gradually subsided, "arrogant" devil out of Lucian's expectation that he did not attack again, using his enduring war to consume his spiritual strength, but integrated In the darkness, there was no more sound coming out, like the predator who quietly followed the prey and waited for it to exhaust and launch a fierce attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is on alert while looking around, this is a wilderness, the dark red soil seems to be soaked with blood, the whole gives an abnormal The feeling of pain and discomfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The painful wilderness..." Lucien sighed softly, which is something that almost every legendary magician who has been to ancient hell will encounter. The landmark is considered to be the greatest feature of ancient hell, so it was named "painful wilderness" by an ancient legendary magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien continues to fly in the desired direction, after all, if this is scared off by the "arrogant" devil, then never explore ancient hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a flight, the "map" in Lucien’s arms screamed strongly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take out the map given by the "Secret Lord", Lucien sees the above sinister symbols as if they are squirming like a vitality, pointing to a certain position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The place where the 'Lord of Silver White' hides the special star nucleus is nearby?" Lucien said to himself, considering it, decided to lick it now. Nothing else, look at it in the past. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the "map" instructions, Lucien flew in the dark and dark sky for a while, seeing a crumbling temple below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dilapidated temple is very similar to the palace outside the "Blue Gate", full of ancient times, supported by a huge stone pillar . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
