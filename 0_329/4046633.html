			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vastly-populated villa is surrounded by a high wall, with a black iron railing forming the outermost door, guarding the two sides of the door Soldiers wearing silver-gray chain armor are opening iron gates for a magnificently decorated aristocratic carriage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems to be a dance party?" Lucien is not a research sorcerer who does not understand the common sense between the nobles, combined with the brightly lit state of the villa, at a glance Judging what is going on inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a little hesitation, after the late arrival, Lucien quickly made up his mind, anyway, came to the door, worried about what to do? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical fluctuations in the body flashed a little inconspicuously, and Lucien walked to the door without slowness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the nobles value the decent and graceful, the dance will come in a carriage no matter how close it is to their home, so Lucy approaches like a civilian. En obviously not the invited guest, the two soldiers are going to stop. At this time, they suddenly felt that Lucien was full of majesty and graceful, and the chest had the Hoofenberg family's badge, which was obviously a very high status. The nobility, so bowed his head and opened the door to welcome the guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Simple spells can be guarded..." Lucien entered the door and shook his head slightly, defending the general with the knight's guarding the gate, but fortunately dark There are also knights in the kingdom intelligence department, but they know themselves without a doubt. "You have to find a chance to set up a warning-type magic trap to prevent the church from starting with Uncle Joel."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the church does not have the same scruples as the cult of the Silver White, it is always good to be prepared, and there is no shortage of lunatics in the night watchman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weather in July is like a fire, and the Lentat, which is only a few hours away from the sea, is still cooler in the evening, and Lucien, who is bathed in the evening, walks in On the Garden Route, smelling the rich floral fragrance, it seems to be integrated into the shadows, so that several aristocratic carriages coming to the dance party have not found such a walker on the roadside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garden is not big, Lusien soon came to the three-storey villa, and all the magic crystal lights in it lit up, dazzling, let The villa looks beautiful, and the common night scene on the earth reveals a magnificent atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the steps of the villa, the still strong Alice will hold the Aalto-style court skirt tightly, with a few maids greeted One after another guest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Miss aristocrats are more than normal..." Lucian was slightly confused, then took a light breath and went straight to Alisa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice’s face was filled with a smile, and she was happy to look at a noble lady who came to the ball and warmly greeted the guests. After life, she is no longer as shackled as she used to be, and her son John is the great knight brought by Her Majesty from Aalto, obviously re-used, responsible for the affairs of the Sword of the Knights of the Truth, the nobles Naturally, she also looked at her and was proud of her participation in the dance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Vr. Turner, Mrs., Miss Kelin, welcome to the ball." Eliza smiled and greeted the newcomer, to the The tall and slim gentle girl is especially enthusiastic, she has a blonde blue eye different from Holm style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Turner knew that Alisa had the purpose of the dance, and smiled and nodded: "It is our pleasure to be able to attend the dance of your wife."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Karin also politely responded with aristocratic courtesy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There was still a period of time before the dance, with the Viscounts of Turner, they went to the small living room to rest." Eliza commanded the servant around her. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Turner family enters, Eliza is full of smiles, ready to welcome new guests, but the familiar black-haired man on the steps makes her I grabbed it, the smile on my face solidified on my face, blinking my eyes in disbelief, a look in my dreams<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After he wore a black double-breasted long dress, but it was such a fit, and his temperament contrasted, the child in his heart seemed to become a mature and stable man in a moment, and Eliza’s emotions rolled and his eyes jerked. Red, his mouth is slightly open, screaming: "Little Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alisa is still a dreamer, shaking her head unbelievably, and the surprise of seeing again is entangled with the shame that once told him: "Little Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong? Eliza, don't you know me?" Lucien laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien has no detached attitude, let Eliza’s other emotions disappear, leaving only excitement and joy, she forgot the hard work of these years. Aristocratic demeanor, like crying in the slums. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She squinted and said very quickly: "Little Evans, do you really come back to see us? I thought you hated me for sale." "You are."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's what I asked you to do, isn't it?" Lucien smiled and hugged Alice, "In my heart, You are like my family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, this, this is great." Eliza looked at Lucien with excitement, "small Evans, you grow taller, so much higher than before!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her right hand trembled compared to Lucifer’s original height, years of repression and Self-blame finally burst out, not waiting for Lucien to answer, pulling him inside: "I have to, I have to tell Joel, tell John, Little Evans is finally back!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant next to the curious look at the hostess's tears, did not dare to remind her that she still had to welcome the guests, so I had to go to the butler to support the scene. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, Eliza frowned and thought that Lucien was tall, but she was thin and stunned, attracting many guests. I was thinking about what happened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice was able to stop the tears when he approached the small living room, wiped his eyes with a white handkerchief, and then took his forehead: "I I forgot, Little John is still on duty at Nexus Palace, and he has to wait until the end. Joel is invited by the Musicians Association to return yet!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing, I will wait..." Lucien’s words were not finished, and Alisa turned herself on the ground, excited and confused: "I have to tell them, tell them that you are back, tell me right away." They! Little Evans, you go to the small living room to rest, I call to remind them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished, she rushed to the study room I have forgotten to lead the way to the small living room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Eliza’s excitement and resentment, Lucien didn’t mind being “forgotten” by her, but she smiled and shook her head. A piece of warmth, it should have been back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any restraint, Lucien came back to his own home and walked into the small living room without a doubt, seeing the Count of Turner and several other nobles. Guests, they are in contact with each other's feelings, looking at Lucien, a stranger with a slightly curious look. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the living room, a strange and exquisite mechanical turning black disc, with melodious and clear music, filled the room with a romantic and elegant atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently nodded and said hello, Lucien walked familiarly to the wall, opened the hidden magic refrigerator, and the crystal light inside was illuminated and reflected Drinks such as refrigerated champagne. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien calmly pulled out the champagne stopper, poured himself a half cup, and then clipped the small ice from the upper layer of the magic refrigerator, just as he had to close the magic refrigerator At the door of the door, there was a voice of the male surname in the back of the voice: "This is the magic refrigerator, the great alchemy article invented by Lucien Evans, let us enjoy the refreshing and cold in the hot summer."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah? His name was spoken from other people in this way. Lucien felt very weird and didn't know what to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 13-year-old boy in the small suit with a typical suit has a typical Holm style look, dark blue eyes, deep facial features, slightly clear, He saw that Lu Xien did not answer, and thought that he did not know the origin of the magic refrigerator, and enthusiastically introduced him: "This kind of magic refrigerator has very little production. Only the big aristocrats and a few ordinary noble families can enjoy it. It is the popularization of alchemy products. The crystallization of life, I also met at other banquets."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, the universalization of alchemy items, life is a great alchemist Lusi The idea put forward by Lord Evans, which has changed our lives in essence, isn’t it?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
