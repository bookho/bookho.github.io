			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After seeing Jackson, John calmed down and said to Lucien: "You have not been formally trained, you must remember, don't panic, The shots are stable and accurate. They have a dagger at most. As long as they give full play to the length of the stick, they can't get close to them. Also, they can't stop, run and fight. They have many people. Once you are surrounded, When you attack from different directions, you have no way to resist it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tries to take care of all the places that need attention, lest Lucien be panicked, or Reckless attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Lucien is deeply aware of this aspect, agrees to nod and humbly answers: "Reassured, John, I am the brave man who has survived the witches' secret room. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John no longer speaks, and the two put the stick behind them, lest they should attract the attention of passers-by who came across, and then quickly walked to Jackson and others. Close together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a street in the market area, only ten minutes away from a stronghold of the Aaron gang, very prosperous, numerous businessmen, adventurers, mercenaries So the proximity of John and Lucien did not cause the perception of Jackson and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few steps away, Lucien and John looked at each other and stretched out the stick behind them, holding both hands tightly. The two gangsters who ran to the last side ran away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien recognized that this was a gangster who had previously flew himself and made himself fall short. After rushing to the vicinity, the stick waved toward him. The head was fiercely beaten. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not enough strength and training is not enough. Lucien has learned from recent battles, except that it is not nervous, not flustered, stable and accurate, and there is Be sure to be embarrassed, as long as you take the shot, you can't think of it, but it will make you feel helpless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whistling sound of the wooden stick caused the gangster to be alert, but for such a short distance, he was only slightly side-faced and was hit by a wooden stick. in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a bang, Lucien hit the bottom of his ear and hit him black, fainted and fell to the ground. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of John is less embarrassing than Lucien. He didn’t choose his head as the target, his hands were like holding a giant sword. Great, hit the right arm of the gangster thug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not the key, but as the official knight of John, the power is better than Lucien, this stick, directly hit the gangsters to fly On the ground, the arm is swollen very high, and the right hand temporarily loses its mobility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien knocked down a gangster thug, didn't stop, ran around the perimeter, and heard another strange voice, turned to look at another gangster thug The head waved and hit him on his face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gangster thugs fell back and forth, and the two bloods raised and traced the twists and turns in the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn’t faint directly, but he could have severe pain and squeaky heads, so that he could only lie on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the front gangsters had completely reacted, and Jackson saw that only Lucien had two people, his eyes became vicious, indicating the rest. The twelve thugs were all around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their daggers were pulled out, reflecting the morning sun, giving a cold glow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien firmly remembers the principle that he can never stop, running irregularly on the periphery, sometimes moving forward, sometimes to the left, sometimes Simply go back, but once you find the opportunity, you will immediately rush back, relying on the length advantage of the stick, slamming the heads and necks of the gangsters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most critical aspect of such tactics is that you can't panic and not be greedy, even if the enemy has been separated, surrounded by several directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street is wide and long, and the passers-by around have escaped, as long as they don’t huddle in a corner, not entangled in the same enemy, plus John leads Those who chased Lucien’s four or five gangsters were completely unable to block the road running on the road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, a gangster was lying on the ground, but Lucien noticed that John on the other side was surrounded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the strength is better than Lucien, the gangsters have a lot of thugs, but John, who didn’t have a slap in the first place, after knocking down five or six gangsters in succession, However, they did not let them lose their fighting power. Instead, they were squatted on the ground. They pulled out their daggers in the left hand and stabbed them to the ankles. So they avoided being accidentally surrounded and the scope of running was narrower and narrower. With agile skills and powerful swordsmanship, he has been stabbed by five or six daggers around him, but his situation is already in jeopardy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien saw it, hesitated for a moment, then gnawed his teeth and rushed straight over, and the stick went to the back of a hitter who surrounded John. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful!" "Johnny!" chased the three gangsters of Lucien, while chasing and shouting to remind the companions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gangsters called Johnny responded quickly, and immediately fell back, letting Lucien’s stick go empty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the same thing, this also made John find the opportunity to rush out of the encirclement. He swept the stick across the circle and forced others to Johnny runs away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnny jumped up and waved his dagger to stab John’s back, and the three gangsters who chased Lucien’s came over. John's front. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after Lucine forced the Johnny to fall, he did not rush to run away, but stayed where it was, so he stayed in place. The wooden stick was just rightly swayed and hit the back of Johnny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a dull voice, Johnny fell to the ground, and even the capital of the capital flew out, unable to stop John from running away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this way, Lucien was trapped by the gangsters who had been surrounded by John, and could only run around in a narrow range. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sigh of relief, Lucien only felt a burning pain in his back, knowing that he could not escape, and he was scratched by a dagger, but Lucien Did not give up, panic, because he from Gary and others probably understand the strength of a formal knight attendant, especially the knight attendant will not have reservations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gangsters inside, certainly will not have this strength, they have long been the leader. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John ran while playing, every time he shot, he was bound, and he was not like Lucian, even if he found the opportunity, the stick might not hit. Even if you hit it, you may not be able to hit the key and let the other party lose the fighting power. As long as he shot, he must be accompanied by a gangster thug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a dozen seconds, the gangsters who chased John were lying on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After solving these few people, John immediately came to help Lucien, and Jackson saw it, and he understood that his strength was amazing. The remaining four fighters were afraid. Unable to stop, so I didn't think much, just turned around and fled. There was a stronghold of the Aaron gang in the street in front. As long as I fled there and gathered people, I could let the two bastards taste the pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After screaming, Andre, who was surrounded by Lucien, was directly stunned by John. The remaining three met Jackson and fled, and some immediately lost. In the war, I wanted to run away, and some of them were fierce, and they waved the dagger more violently, so that Lucien added a wound to her right hand and the blood slowly overflowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthen the pain, Lucien fully believes in John, step forward, licking the length of the stick, knocking the beater in front of him, and that The fierce thugs and the thugs who lost their wars were beaten to the ground by John. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it okay?" John asked Lucien with concern. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head: "Nothing, chase the guy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, The two men were holding wooden sticks and rushing to catch up with Jackson. At this time, Lucien had some inexplicable associations in his mind: "There is a feeling of young and old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson has already ran a certain distance, but after he became the leader, no matter how many times he fights or exercises, he becomes very few, and his body is fatter. The speed is not as good as that of the year, more important. Yes, John is the official knight attendant, tall and long, and he is getting closer and closer to him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
