			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain drizzled, the cool raindrops sprinkled on Donnie’s face, let him slowly return to God, gently shook his head and said: “It should not be me. As he thinks, his performance has no disguise. Anyone who is so gentle and confused will definitely not..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey slowly turns to Mil Going outside the school, I plan to go back to the bedroom to take a rest, raise my spirit, and meet the afternoon's test of ghosts, ghosts and souls. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't wait for Sami, because he knew very well that Sami had definitely left the exam more than an hour ago - this is what Sami is best at. The field, the greatest consumption of his spirit, will make him unable to control his sleep desire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, after Downey returned to the bedroom, he saw Sami lying in bed and slumbering, and the ghost behind him was lazy because of the time of noon. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this familiar Sami, Downey couldn’t help but smile, before the tension, restraint, worry, fear suddenly faded a lot, he Pour a glass of water, sip it, then lie down on your own bed, and watch the ceiling above the ceiling: "You can ride the aircraft equipped with a small fission device and be protected by the Truth Knight's Guardian squad. Carl's identity is definitely not simple. Which big aristocrat is the heir? No, he still has a brother..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Thanks to Carl, today I am refining The sutured body was highly praised by the teacher. In the afternoon, as long as it does not play an abnormal role, it should be able to enter the Heidel School of Magic. With the background of Karl, you can be admitted to the college without any accident..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the imagination, Downey suddenly sighed: "If he is a girl, then everything is perfect, and no advertising girl between TV shows is comparable to him..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really malicious from the world<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a deep breath, ruled out cluttered thoughts, used meditation techniques to get himself into deep sleep, and regained energy for the afternoon exam. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the afternoon, Downey arrived at the Mills Noble School again in the test-only transportation vehicle, led by the gray-haired Necromancer in the morning. Entered a nearby cemetery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around and tried to find the figure of Karl. There were many students who could be tested, and they were scattered in a wide cemetery, blocked by tombstones and trees. It's hard to find someone specific. However, when summoning and driving the ghost, Downey suddenly heard the deep, horrible and terrible cry from afar. It seems to be the horrible ghost of the ghost, and with this cry, there is a life-saving voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Carl is still coming to take the exam, don't know who is so bad? But there is a teacher, there will be no big problem." Downey face Smiling with a smile, there is a happy gloating, "And there are Carl's 'guardians'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he thought, the ghost of horror The sound quickly subsided. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the soul and ghost are not the areas where Downey is best at the best. So he quickly calmed down, put his own exams, and carefully adjusted, corrected, directed, and transformed. It wasn't until the end that he felt that nothing was wrong, he asked the Necromancer to check, and as a result, when he left the cemetery, Karl had already lost his sight. This made him slightly embarrassed, although Karl is a man, but he is always pleasing to see. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Donnie, how is it done?" Downey just returned from the cemetery to the Mills Aristocratic School and heard Sami’s shouting, in the gloomy weather. In the evening, the light was very dim, so Sami's spirit was quite good. The ghost did not hide in the shadow, but waved the fuzzy arm and made a scream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey smiled: "90% of the grasp."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Refers to the grasp of entering the Heidele School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami licked his own mess, and smiled and said: "I am 100%, right, Downey, the exam is over, the bedroom will be recycled, I have to return to Wolfsburg, are you going home? Or staying in Rentatt for the time being, waiting for the result of the admission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Sami’s words, Donnie’s mind suddenly appeared in the figure of his parents and sister, and his thoughts surged like a tide, but he immediately shook his head and pointed to the neck without any accessories. He smiled and said: “I have to Rantart worked for two months and reimbursed the cost of borrowing the awake necklace."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They and the bookstore owner signed the contract. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it?" Sami asked a little surprised, apparently having forgotten what Downey had told him, but he immediately took it. After I left my mind, I said to myself, "I am here to tell you that you can apply for the right to use the dormitory exclusively to the school. It only needs to be returned before September, and it will not affect the occupancy of new apprentices."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really?" Downey was screaming where he was going to find a cheap place to live, and then he was surprised and happy, and the previous ones were swept away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So, you saved a lot of money, have to ask me for a big meal!" Sami said jokingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no graduation, because he believes that Downey will definitely be seen again at the Heidel School of Magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Downey went to the "heart of nature" The school's Academic Affairs Office applied for the right to use the dormitory. After setting out his difficult conditions and excellent academic performance, the compassionate elf teacher readily approved his request. Then he rushed to the Arc de Triomphe without a break. Into the "knowledge bookstore." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss with owl-like eyes, Dorothy smiled and looked at Downey with a smile: "I thought you were going to break the contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was a delay in the school, this is your awake necklace." Downey respectfully handed the necklace to the boss, without this awake necklace, the last two or three The review and consolidation of the month is definitely not so efficient. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss Dorothy gently daggers: "You wipe all the bookshelves and spines today."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;After the command, he quickly greeted the guests who came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey is not a spoiled child. After finding a rag in the corner, he started his hard work. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While wiping, he looked at the name of the book - reading is his greatest hobby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""Evans Test," Lucien Secret, "Universal Entrance Examination, Five Years of Study, Three Years of Review, One Year Sprint - From Lord Evans Student's experience summary..." Looking at this row of books, Downey only felt that his forehead blood vessels suddenly jumped, feeling irritated, disgusting and nausea, and wished to burn them all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to the bedroom last night, Downey saw similar exercises on his bookshelf and magical analysis questions, if not the thick books Selling with your own problem-solving method can make a lot of money, I am afraid I have burned them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why can't you get rid of nightmares here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good in the knowledge bookstore only this row The bookshelf is about the practice set. Otherwise Downey suspected that he would go mad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he wiped most of the bookshelves, the time was close to noon, and the boss Dorothy opened the home TV set on the wall and watched the news of "Imperial Midday". program. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because of the recent two magicians playing virtual adventure games, the Kairu Master, who is known for his love, officially applied to the Panel and the Magic Research Council. It is required to stop funding the 'Virtual Magic Practice' project. It is considered that this project has a very serious security risk. Artificial intelligence, alchemy life and illusion stimulation will inevitably have problems. The arcane division of this project must propose practical preventive measures. After that, I can start again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news anchor is a dark-haired, blue-eyed Ms. Holm, with a graceful appearance and a pleasant voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the responsible arcian of the 'Virtual Magic Practice' project, Ms. Heidi, publicly stated that the two sudden deaths and the 'virtual reality' of the arcane concept are not Any contradiction, only need to perform physical examination before using illusion stimulation, she believes that the attack of Kairu Master is ridiculous, lacking logic, just like someone drunk and driving an alchemy car to the cliff. The result is not forbidden to drink and drive , but the general promotion of the promotion of alchemy cars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
