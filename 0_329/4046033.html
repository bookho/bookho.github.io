			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is not just a fool who is focused on music and nervousness. He feels very much about Wolff’s hostility. He is angry and funny, and he is not robbing himself. He had the opportunity to hold a concert in the Hall of the Holy Ghost. Only when the board of directors screened and compared the musicians, it happened to be the final discussion with him. To blame anyone, I would have to blame Wolff for being better at writing comments. Instead of creating music, I forgot my musical pursuit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, Wolf, I am writing a new piano concerto, very satisfied, do you want to listen in advance?" Victor smiled back and went back. His piano concerto has been registered with the Musicians Association and is not worried about the plagiarism after Wolff listened. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf didn’t expect Victor to sweep the downturn and decadence for a few weeks, full of confidence, his face immediately became iron, two screams, stiff Said: "Victor, I still keep a little curious, I hope that after three months, in the Hall of the Holy Grail, you should not let me down." Victor is so confident, Wolfe is afraid that after listening to his piano concerto, not only I can't think of the harsh words to hit him. Instead, I will make myself sleepless for three months and sleep well. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor spread his hand and said with a smile: "I am really sorry, I would have liked you to give some advice."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wolf didn't want to continue on this topic, looked at the road, saw Lucien next to Victor, saw his old, cheap linen clothes, and then lifted his chin in disdain and said: "Victor When did you meet the low-lying, uncultivated poor?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although from Woolf’s great-grandfather, their family has not been seen for generations. Fortunately, but no matter what, Wolf’s distant relatives still have a Viscount, and several of the Lord’s, do not prevent him from being a member of the nobility, and despise the civilians of Viktor’s origins, always kept glamorous and noble. Attitude, naturally, not to mention the poor people of Lucien, plus the hate and hatred of Victor, seeing Lucien beside him, Wolf is like seeing a disgusting mouse ran to his own table. on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s almost awkward tone to Wolf, except for a little anger, is full of deep laughter, no matter where it is, as long as there is wealth and wealth The difference between the status and the status of others is that people will artificially distinguish between "guilds" and modern society. The modern world is better, and the strange world of the Renaissance and the darkness of the Middle Ages is completely naked and proud. To change this kind of discrimination, we must rely on our own strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor is a civilian, and he has an indescribable dislike of Wolf’s attitude. He frowned and said seriously: "Follow your words." Wolf, this is the student who recently followed me to study music. Lucian, well, a young man with great musical talent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Victor himself has no discrimination against the poor, but the influence of the atmosphere, atmosphere and education of the whole world is still very deep. Therefore, when introducing Lucien, in order to prevent him from being discriminated against, plus his own dislike of Wolf. Victor couldn't help but blow the cow. Even now, he doesn't know whether Lucien will be born with a lack of music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hahaha, he, hahahaha, he has musical talents? A low-lying poor who has never been influenced by music and education, will have musical talent? Victor I think you are in order to prepare for the concert and your mind has become abnormal." Wolfe seems to have heard a very funny joke, laughed and lost his grace, leaned forward and leaned forward, and the grievances just disappeared completely, loudly Laughing at Victor and Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor didn’t expect his good-hearted bragging, but it caused Wolf’s reaction so much that he could only continue to talk hard when he lamented that he could hardly understand Wolf. Supporting the earth: "Aalto is the city of holiness and the capital of music. Everyone here is favored by the Lord and immersed in music. Even the poor, there are many excellent bards, and some people Music talent is the gift of the Lord. It is born with it. The edification and education of the day after tomorrow is only to erase the dust that covers the gems, let it bloom the original brilliance, isn't it?"<br /><br />&nbsp Wolfe shook his head with a smile and pointed to Lucien: "There is such a musical genius, but since the Lord's gift, the power of blood and grace should be easily motivated, so Na Her Royal Highness Princess Tasha is, Lord Earl Verdi is, and your 'student', what is it, um, Lucian, certainly not, if he can become a great musician, I am in Music Review. Publicly apologize to you and him, and then Not a concert "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;According to the information that Lucien knows these days, Princess Nathasha is the only blood of the Grand Duke of Vaolirit, the Count of Violet, and this title is the first title that must be inherited before each Grand Duke succeeds. The Vaoliite family is the Violet family. Her musical talent is very good. She is good at violin, flute, and harpsichord. If it is not because of her identity, I am afraid it has become an excellent musician. Of course, as a knight, Natasha is also a top five knight. Just twenty-five years old, it is not far from the ranks of the Knights of Heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count of Verdi is also a member of the Violet family, the nephew of the Grand Duke, who has written several excellent pieces of music, and is currently not in his own territory. He was the highest governor of the City Guard in Aalto and has just become a five-level knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, Wolf didn't look at Victor and smiled and walked up the stairs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicker shook his head in disgust, and said to Lucien: "Don't ignore this narrow, bitter, vulgar guy, and do your own learning." You have to deal with other things in the afternoon. I will come to Elena tomorrow morning and let her take you to the library. Well, I will take a day off after a week, specifically on Saturday, or after the week. I will see you and manage the library together. How did the companions discuss it, well, I went to the concert hall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching Victor leave, Lucien turned his head and handed the contract to Irene Na: "I will trouble you tomorrow, Elena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena smiled and there was a small vortex on the left: "This is mine." Work, Lucien. Right, let's ignore Mr. Wolff. In the association, most people don't like him, except for the few directors, well, the director of the title."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, always arrogantly take the chin and look at our Mr. Wolf, will it be humble and respectful Several directors of the chin? "Lucien according to the meaning of words Elena, a humorous satire, prompting Elena giggled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smile with Elena, Lucien was busy going back to explore the entrance to the sewer, so she made a farewell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien!" After a few steps, Lucien suddenly heard Elena's scream and looked back at her with confusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elena’s right hand was held in a small fist and waved: “Lu Xien, I believe in you, even if you can’t become a musician, you have to be excellent. The musician, look at the expression of Mr. Wolf!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before entering the Musicians Association, Elena’s life is between the poor and Between the civilians, therefore, Wolfe’s tone was empathy and very dissatisfied. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien learned that she waved her fist and perfunctored: "Sure!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9 o'clock in the evening, except for a few drunks, the Ade district has been unable to see the figure, and there is occasional low-lying wild dog in the silence of a night. The sound of the sound, for the world's poor, has always been to go to bed early, there is no colorful nightlife in the evening, in the morning also need to get up early, busy for a day's livelihood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dinner, I got help from Mr. Victor and found a very good job. Good news told Uncle Joel and Eliza. Sean learned to return to his hut on the pretext, doing meditation and waiting for the analysis of the magic to prepare for learning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smallly flash out of the cabin and gently close the wooden door, Lucien walked lightly to the entrance of a remote sewer that was explored in the afternoon, waiting for himself to After the four magical arrays are resolved, you can use the magic material to arrange and use some weakened and auxiliary versions of formal magic. For example, “micro-effect fossils into mud” is to open a secret passage to the sewer in your own house, and in the sewer. It's tempting to build a magical lab's useful magic, so you don't have to go in and out at that time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After patiently observing the surrounding people, Lucien carefully entered the sewer entrance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, the stinking smell, the greasy, dirty environment around, although still makes Lucien uncomfortable and uncomfortable, but can’t stop him. Learn the passion of magic, shuttle through the sewers, look for remote corners, and mark rough sewer maps in the Soul Library. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
