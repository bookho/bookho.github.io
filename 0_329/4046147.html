			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of the dining room is paved with patterned rock, and the faint scent of flowers masks the original remnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien locked the wooden door, pretending to tidy up the clothes in the mirror, carefully checking the toilet inside, and then waited for a few tens of seconds. Take the fist-sized morning crystal ball and a cold iron dagger from the wide pocket on the left side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick up the dagger and gently stroke the left wrist, the feeling of icy slowness is introduced into the brain of the road, and a drop of blood falls on the sink. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Lucien’s right index finger stretched out, and the strange sign was written in the void, and it was dragged by the scarlet blood. Complex magic line structure. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the arrangement that Lucien used to cover up and use the magical waves generated by the crystal ball. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the effect of the rushed magic array can be difficult to say, the unpredictable feelings of Lucien’s heart made him consider it so much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singular performance of the Gray Town and the Baron Habero made Lucien think that he would encounter great dangers that he could not get rid of if he hesitated and delayed for a while. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical line painted by the blood slowly illuminates, and the blood of the demon is soft and soft, wrapping the beautiful crystal ball in the center. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s hands stretched out, squandering the crystal ball, and dreaming of a mysterious swearing mantra in his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crystal ball gradually fades deep and dark, and the bright but fuzzy stars illuminate in it, as if the reflection of the night sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most unique and difficult to learn astrology of the astrology! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Lucien became the official magician and got the "Morning Crystal Ball", he thoroughly mastered the "primary astrology knowledge" and the original astrophysics knowledge. He quickly learned "primary astrology," and the accuracy and clarity of the results slightly exceeded the extent of the initial astrology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes Lucien even more curious about "destiny." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical mysterious star trajectory passes, and the starry sky in the crystal ball begins to form a unique star. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black eyes recovered from the dark squats. Lucien frowned: "From the results of astrology, the star of destiny does have signs of gloom, and the danger has been shrouded. And it seems that as time goes on, the danger will become stronger and stronger, and even the main star of fate may be degraded!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien's "Beginning Although astrology is a little more than the same level, it still only results in very vague, only roughly clear dangers, such as what the danger is, where it comes from, why it is getting stronger, and who the enemy has. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even the "prophet" astrology is equally inaccurate, full of vague names. This is the mystery of fate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retracting the morning crystal ball, Lucien takes the dark red "firer bracelet" from the right pocket and wears it, then it will reveal a metallic texture and The sapphire radiant ice and snow Avengers ring is placed on the index finger of the left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the guards just took the vigilant sword, but Lucien was afraid that the baron could identify the magic items, so in addition to being covered by the clothes themselves, "External, it is to take the other two pieces in advance and hide them." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The results of astrology are vague, and it is not certain whether the danger comes from the baron. It is likely to be after the departure from the castle. Is it just because I feel that I am in danger? Just turn your face?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you delay the observation, wait until the real danger comes, maybe it is already late!"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ The instinct of self-protection without hurting the innocent people's ideas and dangers is fierce in the heart of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I understand that the urgency of Lucien is not too much entanglement, hiding the weak dagger in the sleeve and taking out the water from the reservoir. The sound of slaps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since I am not sure, then I will try my own! If you make a mistake, there is still room for remedy for apology, but you can do nothing, then you really have nothing to do! Because the dead are not at all. What to do!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Must seize the opportunity to solve it before the danger of falling my destiny star!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien opened the wooden door of the bathroom, his hands naturally drooping, and the pace walked firmly and decisively toward the table. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Lucien just took a few steps, but unexpectedly found that Baron Habero and Karin were not at the table, so he asked more vigilantly and alertly. "Where did the Baron and Mrs. Karin go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if this change has already made Lucien’s heart start to have a rush, the feeling of having to hurry, can be toned Still calm and natural, "The Baron is a little uncomfortable. Mrs. Karin helped him to go to the bedroom to take the potion, and so on." Betty slightly worried about Habero's physical condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently squeezed his head, his eyes cold: "Then I went to visit the Baron."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Is the "Sorrow" just let him lose control of his emotions, causing bad changes inside the body, or are you ready to start? If it is the former, it will go straight to the past, and it seems that he has not recovered. It seems to be the best choice, and if it is the latter, unexpected actions can interrupt the other's plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the baron may also be a hero who is truly kind and relapsed. What he needs is an apology and a gift, but this is not worth the risk. mention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, the Baron will soon be back." Betty stood up in surprise and looked at Lucian, Simon, Joanna and Wise The same way, Lucien did not answer them and turned to go outside the restaurant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Betty and others who were at a loss, Lucien went to the door and asked the guarded soldiers: "Where is the Baron’s bedroom? I think Go and visit him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, the Baron adults told you to stay in the restaurant." The two soldiers will hold the ceremonial rifle cross, blocking the door, tone Courtesy but no emotional response. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded, smiled slightly, suddenly shaped and slammed into one of the soldiers, the hidden dagger in his sleeve thorned at him Arm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restaurant was quiet, and no one thought that Lucien would do it directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is crazy? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Longsang? Aaron’s debilitating dagger was tied to the soldier’s body, but he should have become weak and weak. Instead, he pulled out his long sword and slashed to Lucien. The muscles on his face picked up, as if to crack. Open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his arm is not bleeding, but pale yellow pus, stench and bad smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is agile, easy to hide, and the dagger is sent, the neck of the soldier is cut, and one side is rolled over, avoiding another one. The long gun of a soldier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Killing... Evans is killing!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if it is a calm and capable Simon and Joanna was stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they immediately saw that Mr. Evans had a faint milky white light, and the soldier with a long gun screamed and slammed on the ground. The flesh rots quickly, as if it has been dead for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Simon asked subconsciously, if the performance of the first soldier’s body decayed quickly, it could be pushed to Mr. Evans’ black gloomy dagger. The change of the soldier gave him a bad feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien collected the weak dagger, picked up the vigilant sword, and calmly replied: "The corpse. Mr. Mars, you know where the Baron’s bedroom is. "I don't know too much about the magic of the Necromancer!" Although the debilitating dagger is better than the vigilant sword, but with the training of John and Natasha, Lucien is able to play with a long sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
