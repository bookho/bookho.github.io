			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For matrix mechanics, Lucien is only just learning, and this time deliberately did not read the information in the soul library, deducing it by memory and understanding. Therefore, it is not as smooth and natural as every time I write a thesis. With the help of magic, it is a dozen pages, which is quite difficult. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you can choose Dirac to be more concise, more beautiful, and more in line with the quantum mechanics versions understood by current arcans, using the past arcane system. Some mathematical tools to deal with, but the matrix, which is very fashionable to listen to the name, has a wide range of uses in many fields in the future. It is best to take the opportunity to raise it. Anyway, in two months, it will throw out Dirac’s thesis and let the arcane The divisions were freed from the maze of the matrix. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the front part of the thesis, Lucien spent a lot of space building the mathematical tool of the matrix, and explained its definitions and algorithms one by one. Then the content of true quantum mechanics began. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the equation of electronic motion, Lucien used mathematical methods to unfold it, and then observable through the large and complex operations of the matrix. Based on the Arcane value, the whole model is built into something similar to the classic Douglas-Oliver system, except that in this system, the operation method is matrix. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the difficult writing, Lucien gradually integrated the mechanics of matrix mechanics and gained a deeper grasp of the matrix’s unfriendly complex mathematical tools. There is a strong interest in the meaning of the arcane that it represents in quantum mechanics. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passes by, the night outside the window is getting thicker and thicker, and the ground is covered with a thick layer of snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know how long it took, the paper in front of Lucien was already a thick stack, and he was writing faster and more smoothly. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Lucien raised his hand and drew a full period, marking the end of the main part of the paper, marking the true quantum mechanics of the creation, and It is no longer a simple patchwork of semi-classical and semi-quantum like the new alchemy model in the past! At this time, Lucien did not stop, and continued to use the new theory of matrix mechanics to derive conclusions. The quantization conditions imposed on electrons in the past are complicated but clear. The operation is naturally guided! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uninterrupted, Lucien’s cognitive world emerges, semi-cured, which is no longer satisfied with the illusory changes of the soul, but fills the study, The high stars are like ceilings, shining on the ground, and countless elements of light are now transformed into atomic models. The electrons that surround the neutrons and protons move like an ethereal dark cloud, sometimes showing fluctuating surnames, sometimes showing particles. surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light and shadow in the room is reflected on the snow like the most eccentric and weird hell, there seems to be a devil mad roar: "Stop! Stop Live! Going down is the deepest part of hell!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Continue, keep going! You will release the most horrible and unimaginable devil!" The falling snow is like a white angel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will destroy the whole world! And you, the sinful magician, will be taken out of the heart and dried up on the volcano!"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditory hallucination slammed into the ear of the West, but he did not stop, continue to use the matrix to rigorously deduct the results, compared with the results of the spectral experiment, compared with the empirical formula, and numerous new Experimental comparison of alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the cognitive world emerged, the atomic model remained intact, and Lucien would not rashly change his cognitive world until everything was perfect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by one data, perfect with the experimental results! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formulas are naturally derived, consistent with past empirical formulas! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night enters the most intense and deepest moment, the snowflake is like a white paper flower at the funeral, embellished with the feeling of despair, sorrow, silence, death, chilling, Fear of heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the roar of the devil is getting more and more fierce: "You are spying on the truth of the world, it will be torn into pieces!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angel also issued the ultimate intimidation: "You are not opening the door to the mountain of heaven, but a cage of destruction, sinner! The world will be exactly the opposite of your imagination!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go to hell, the truth of the world is not tolerated! Not to be near! Damn Arcane Master, you will never find what you want! I will take your soul out and put it in the flames. Burning for 10,000 years!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second time there was a similar auditory hallucination, Lucien didn’t know whether he was feeling shaken or the result of real-world feedback, or Both have shaken their heads, took a deep breath, continued to deduct, and introduced the most critical and most fundamental formula in matrix mechanics that violated the general mathematical rules:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momentum multiply position is not equal to position multiplier! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This formula that is inconsistent with the multiplication law has just been derived. The roar of the devil and the intimidation of the angels have all become fearful demands:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "End it, beg you to tear it up, this is the key to unlocking the door!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you Stop, you will be the savior remembered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As long as you stop, I will meet all your requirements."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cognitive world, the orbital model of electrons has changed again. The dark clouds of electrons are naturally distributed according to three quantum numbers. After several years of indiscriminate operation, they Finally, I have my own arrangement rules, and the protons and neutrons have also changed accordingly. This makes Lu Xien not too solid soul and cognitive world to solidify, and the primary version of the wave two The surname of the meditation finally has a higher level of unity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast, inaccessible illusory starry sky reappears, inspired by strange and familiar forces, a complex three-dimensional magical symbol recognized in Lucien Produced in the world of knowledge, it constitutes a strange, unimaginable spell model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is not semi-solidified in the cognitive world, Lucian controls the scope of influence very well, making it difficult for outsiders to find out, if it is seen from the snow to Lucien "Babel Tower" will see a strange light and shadow in a window, like countless devils dancing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The amount that does not conform to the law of multiplication is called the amount of miscomfort..." Lucien has not stopped, continue to write down, "...and A set of uncomfortable quantities is an amount that cannot be determined at the same time. Knowing one of them accurately will inevitably lead to uncertainty in another quantity. For example, when you fully understand the speed and quality of an electron, you will find that it has lost its trace. , no position..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... After derivation, similar amounts have time and energy. When time is very certain, enough time, energy will be inexplicable Inflated and dropped, there is a huge energy fluctuation in the vacuum... Perhaps, every moment, we are surrounded by such 'vacuum fluctuations'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ah!" A screaming scream came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey!" A tragic weeping sounded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle was just written by Lucien, and the "Devil" and "Angel" became desperate and disappeared without a trace. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness is still the same, the snow is still the same, just the white paper-like snow flakes have stopped! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien knows that the strange spell model is built successfully, and it is a new legendary magic. By instinct, Lucien believes This kind of magic based on quantum mechanics based on the principle of uncertainty is very strange. It seems to have a trace of destructive determinism, which is the atmosphere of causality and fatalism that the world's arcans think. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the results of the perfect match with the experimental data and the empirical formula, Lucien closed his eyes. Where is the difference between the two worlds? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does a world have souls and magic, and a world does not? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two auditory hallucinations occur, once when the Planck constant is derived, that is, the beginning of quantum mechanics, and once is the first time when quantum mechanics is truly established. At the second time, there was a factor of emotional instability. But this time, I seem to be very calm. Is it all here? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
