			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sparkling diamonds are set on the black velvet, giving a bright, radiant glow, expansive and dreamy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the eternal beauty of the night plateau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bathing in the stars, Lucien crossed the black wall of heavy shadows and left the projection of the observer castle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the cover of a tree swaying like a living tree, Lucien put on a deformed mask, the body stretched and the skin was delicate and pale. The eyes became like the silver moon at night, the hair faded deep and the demon was silvery. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few seconds, the "Rhine" wearing a bright red shirt and a black evening dress appeared on the night plateau. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sorted out the bow tie, letting himself keep the strange cleanliness and meticulous dress of the Rhine, and then proceeded to the vampire castle in the distance with an "elegant" pace. Forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of Lachar, has lived a powerful vampire for 5,000 years, guarding the space nodes connected to the southern desert of the Gusta Empire, preventing Creatures other than vampires come in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, in the treasure house of the Rhine, Lucien finally gave up a few seven or eight magic wands and chose "pale justice." This is not because it can immune the fascinating, violent, helpless negative state, but it is fancy that it can be used as a first-order legendary item in the face of evil creatures such as the Necromancer. It is extremely horrible, and is known by Lucien. Nothing in high-end items! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current mission of Lucien is related to the Necromancer community and has been tracked by a high-ranking undead, so the weapon against the Necromancer must be selected first. Besides, the vampire is also a dead spirit. Here is the night plateau, with many dangerous vampires! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the limitation that the Knights of the Sixth Heaven must pick up, Lucien has his own solution, and the Light Ogre Gloves can increase his strength. The level of the five-level knights, together with a number of medium and low-level magic to enhance the power, such as the four-ring "brute force", the second ring "the brute force of the cattle", etc., barely able to reach the minimum strength of the six-day knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this can only last for a few minutes, it is enough to pick up the "pale justice" and play its "nothing but not" effect! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the six-ring spell that Lucian hasn’t yet learned, there’s the magic of “Ball’s Transfiguration” that can make the magician change instantly. Knight of the ranks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there is a little bit of caution in the heart of Lucien: this is a powerful and bright knight sword, when the relationship develops to a certain extent, Give it to someone as a gift, deepen your feelings or determine your relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be said that Lucien occasionally dreams of a bright future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The steep, tower-shaped quirky castle on the left side has a magnificent palace. It is propped up by a large stone pillar with neat and smooth stone tiles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of Lucien, it resembles the temple of ancient Greece on earth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisp sound of the leather shoes stepping on the stone bricks spread far away, a tall vampire wearing a brown formal dress and pale face stopped in front of Lucien . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why come to the palace of the Marquis of La Charle?" This vampire is very proud. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, who has become a Rhein-like figure, smiled and said: "I am using a node transfer array."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Does the Marquis agree?" The vampire replied arrogantly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looks calm, and he is very anxious: "According to the Presbyterian rules, every blood family can use most of the space in the night plateau. Node, don't you include it here?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine is a substantial vampire prince, a member of the Blood Presbyterian Church, involving a lot of people, if you stay too long, Maybe another vampire prince will come over and it will be easy to get rid of camouflage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vampire did not dare to directly oppose the Presbyterian rule. "There are also traitors among the blood races, and maybe you are disguised. If you don't have the consent of the Marquis, I must check it carefully."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written tone, rigid attitude, right hand moving, seems to be asking for something. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien probably guessed his purpose, but the Rhine he was playing was a legendary vampire with a gentle and inner pride. How could he bribe him? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do this, once you know it, you will be sure that you are disguised, but the inspection is not like the name of Rhein. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver eyes are slightly picked up, Lucien will hint at this vampire, how far he can go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien had an old voice behind without warning: "Our observer, long time no see."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marquis of La Charle is coming? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s heart almost jumped up, he must not be familiar with Rhein, otherwise he might see himself through words and demeanor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gate, sir?" The vampire body that asked for bribes began to tremble clearly, and the expression of the opposite bloody clan was clearly clear in the mind. Only then did I know that I had walked on the edge of "death" and almost disappeared from the legend! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his fears and fears, Lucien did not care, calmly and calmly said: "Rachal, I am going to the southern desert."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not dare to say too much, try to be concise, so as not to reveal flaws, and the title is specifically reminded by the Rhine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Observer, Prince Dracula has been looking for you." Rachael is a "white" elegant "elegant" old man with a delicate cane I smiled and smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He? What do you want to do?" Lucien turned his head and took a gentle and beautiful smile on the Rhine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La Charle snorted, knowing that Prince Dracula was peeping at the "talent" you could borrow from the ancestral power, but deliberately asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Prince Dracula wants you to attend the last Blood Presbyterian Church to discuss the internal disputes in the Dark Council." Rachael said on the bright side reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumor that "The Earl of Silvereye" has been missing for so long is being seriously injured by a legendary strongman, so he hides and recovers, and Prince Dracula is so eager to move - his Talented ability is the gift of consuming and absorbing others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most powerful prince of the blood family, the most ancient vampire is not as popular as the "Silver Moon" Etna, and Dracula has always been stunned. Huai. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien still maintains a light smile, said to the eight-level vampire warlock: "I have been absent so many times, do not care to increase once."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s hard to imitate the rhetoric of Rheinland! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if he is guided in a dream, Lucien feels that it is very difficult to play a legendary strongman. Of course, relatively speaking, pretending to be a teacher Fernando is a lot easier, just roaring and roaring and roaring, any doubters will be scared to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Observer, I think Prince Dracula has already recovered from his sleep after knowing your news." Rachael replied "not humble". "He would like to meet with you to discuss the future of the blood family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sorry, I am in a hurry." Lucien's heart stopped for a beat. I almost forgot to imitate the tone of the Rhine, but fortunately controlled in time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the body becomes an undead, maybe there is already a drop of cold sweat coming out of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachard has a deep understanding of the attitude of "Rhein" that seems to be approachable and arrogant and indifferent. Seeing that he is moving towards the node, he has to go forward and hurry up. Road: "Observer, please wait."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
