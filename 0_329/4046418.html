			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony's remote corner, Huo Ran illuminates the faint light ball twisted into a group, and instantly stretches into a strange and secretive door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door slammed open, Lucien’s figure was pushed out, and everything went to calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to the spirit of the road is like a tide, and the surrounding situation is quickly reflected in the mind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a low hill and a piece of wood. It is quiet except for a few cold-resistant animals that are frightened and run away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing, Lucien’s alert and alert mind was really relaxed, and the “space jump” reel in his hand was put back into the storage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holme Crown Ring "Origin" Constant Seven-ring Magic "Chaotic Transfer" is a space transfer that cannot control the destination and may allow Lucien to appear directly In the White Maple Leaf Palace or the Basilica of San Francisco, there is also a small chance that he will flash on the street, causing concern and confusion, being chased by the church and the nobility, so Lucien has to play every minute. The spirit, in order to deal with all kinds of complicated situations, now it seems that luck is not bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, is it near the villa in Borak? It’s a coincidence. The minimum standard for the distance is not enough to transmit. It should be that the space in the underground palace interferes with the power. "I don't know if it was because the change became the appearance of Borak, and he had the same blood, which caused a mysterious connection. Lucien found the place after the "chaotic transmission" in the villa where he hid the Borak. Not far away, when going to the nobility area before going through, you must pass the road under the hill. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, Lucien hides the form and rushes toward the villa in Borak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Since the transfer is here, I will leave something for you, but I am honest and trustworthy 'good devil'."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of things is ups and downs, and the changes are endless. At this point, Lucien will be arrogant and arrogant and continue to hide in Antilles, looking for time to help Borac carry out blood transfusion surgery. Anyway, he also confiscated his ten-year life is not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the principle of being a man, since he has benefited from the body of Borak, he should also be paid for him, originally intended to be sent to adventurers, now Save this cost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient villa of the gorse family, a group of news came The Marquis and the Earl are all gloomy, the atmosphere is very oppressive, and some are saddened by the concealment, and the children they love are actually killed in the claim of the very safe gorse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...This is the case, a mysterious high-level magician smashed our inspection with a weird deformation, mixed into the underground palace, summoned rumors The ancient devil in the moment, temporarily controlled the glory of the crown, created a chaotic killing, and stolen the secret treasure of our family 'the sun's scepter'. Only Prince Baier, Princess Sophia and a few lucky children are honored in the crown. Sacrificing the confrontation between one's own life and the devil, we are able to break the underground palace to save."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke of the gorse, Ulrich, said with sorrow and sorrow, "I can understand your feelings. Our family's Alten, Ralph, and the glory of the crown are not able to escape the evil master's claws. The gorse family will do their best to meet your requirements."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "fact" after he and Sophia discussed it, pushing everything to the mysterious high-level magician, so I know a little about Real Reality. In the underground Former house of magic to break, he entered a "death list." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the surviving aristocratic children were involved in the plan to murder the prince, no one would reveal secrets to people outside the family, and at the time they were all made by Lucien Falling into sleep, the later things can be made up by Sophia. For example, when the evil magician wants to kill them, the glory of the crown that has not really died is suddenly emerged, dragging the injured body, getting rid of the projection of the devil, and starting with the magician. The war has supported the rescue of the outside world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Porti, which is somewhat similar to Duda, said with a face: "Requirement? I only have one request, that is to catch the damn magician." I want him to regret living in this world!" Du Da is his most beloved son. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the sacrifice of the gorse family is far greater than them. The two direct heirs are not mentioned, and the golden knight of the guardian family is actually killed. This is a huge loss that cannot be recovered! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this situation, the Marquis and the Earl of the present were relatively considerate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reassured, even if you don't want revenge, the gorse family will never give up, we must seize the evil magician and burn it in the underground palace. Ulrich expressed his determination to revenge. "But because the deformation technique is too strange, the damn magician is very careful. At present we can't confirm his identity and breath. It is difficult to hunt down by normal means, but Nuremberg I have already asked Cardinal Inman, and asked him to go to the underground palace to use the power of the gods to trace the scene and find clues."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the best." The father of the Count of Mecklenburg was in a complicated position. Although Denny was disgusted with himself, he was a biological son after all. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter is significant, ten minutes later, the cardinal of the middle-aged man looks like Bishop Inman, accompanied by the nobles, entered the underground palace hall, but they were very disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magician was very careful, except for the breath of Borak, there was almost no trace left, and his final battle with Midrand seemed to be devastating. It is impossible to trace back the useful scenes." The plain white robes of Yingman's face are slightly sad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Earl of Porti’s breathing became heavy and his hands were brutally violent: “Dear Lord Inman, is there no other way to confirm his identity? Has so many outstanding young people died in vain? Are we watching the damn magician arrogant?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every nobles present This result cannot be accepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yingman pondered for a few seconds: "Then I made a wish to the true God and asked Him to give hints."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Nine-level prophecy-like magic, praying! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, Mr. Inman." Portiton was excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes of many nobles, Yingman holds his own sacred emblem of truth, devoutly and swaying, and drives everyone to stumble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul seems to be caught in a pure light, Inman whispered: "The Holy Great Lord, pray that you will remind me of the mystery in the underground palace. The identity of the magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A high-pitched, uninteresting voice came from the unknown: "Six Rings, Magic Council, magic items far more common High-level magician."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only this hint?" Inman thought with sorrow but couldn't dare to question, how does this make him identify himself? Many of the archaeologists and legendary magicians have far more than ordinary high-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound disappeared and there was no response. Thinking for a while, Yingman got up and announced to the nobility: "This is a legendary magician student, his teacher interfered with my magic, let I can only get very few tips, I hope I can help you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to Inman’s words, Ulrich gritted his teeth: "Magic Council There are only a few hundred six-ring magicians, one by one, and I have to find out!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antilever White Maple Leaf Palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia looked forward to the majestic and calm middle-aged man in front of him: "Father, do you know who the mysterious magician is?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the underground palace, she witnessed her father Rudolf II destroying the remnant atmosphere in the hall by secret means, and just shot the intercession of the cardinal Inman, thinking that he I already know the identity of the other party. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudolph II said with no expression: "When he was deformed, fate was closely entangled with Borak, not in front of me, and I kept the legendary level. I can't tell the difference. I interfere with the praying, just don't want Inman to know that I have appeared in the underground palace, to avoid him thinking too much."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"And the magic items on his body have been modified in appearance, and can only be slowly compared according to the effect. This is a long process." Rudolf II did not care who the six-ring magician was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophia just wanted to speak, and he listened to Rudolf II and continued: "You performed well this time, and the title of the Duke of Allman was rewarded." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really, really?" Sophia had some stuttering. Although the Duke of Orman was not big, it contained many mineral-rich mountains and was directly under the royal family. The richest top five of the territory is no worse than Bayer's Steinburg. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudolph II gently beheaded: "I have never repented if I said it. You and Bayer must work hard, maybe I stay on the throne." Time will be shorter than you think."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Sophia was very excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ecstasy and excitement has been maintained until she returns to her palace and sees the familiar room layout. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deni..." Sophia’s mood suddenly became depressed and annoyed, then hate the earth, "damn bastard, I must find you!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolak is waking up under the glare of bright light, only feeling himself Being powerless, as if experiencing a long and jumping dream, dreaming of becoming a second-class knight, dreaming of his victory over Alten to get the title of Count Tiris, grotesque, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, my bedroom, my bedroom?" Borak looked around and found that it was a familiar place. Suddenly, memories came back to my mind, not myself. Does the study summon a greedy devil? Didn't you trade the life of the Cavaliers for ten years? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory is vivid, and Borak does not doubt that it is an illusion. Instead, he thinks that he is stupid and returns to the bedroom to sleep, suddenly, excited and excited mood The heart, I have the strength of the official knight, but also so afraid of Alten? Still so afraid of the underground palace trial? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the activity of the arm, the smile on the face of Borak immediately froze, and trembled and said: "Why? Why? Why am I still a knight?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Greedy the devil? Are we not signing a contract?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it, is it? A dream?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolak screamed in frustration and suddenly found something in his pocket, so he quickly slammed it out and found that A few sheets of paper and a tube of dark red liquid, it seems to appeal to the soul when it flashes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unexpectedly opening the paper, Borak saw a not-so-complex magical flow chart, written at the top:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""If you want to gain the strength of the second-level knight and keep the advanced knight, please follow the steps below:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Find a formal magician or warlock."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two to nine, follow the eight steps of the flow chart to complete the initial surgery, the blood source of the vampire into the body ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ten, enjoy the results, ensure no pain and no side effects."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you are worried Danger, there is an excellent way: First, find a high-level vampire, and second, let it bite."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a devil exaggerated behind Laughing avatar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn! Borak suddenly realized that he blushes and tears the paper into several pieces. He is thrown into the ground. When he is finished, he is so teased, so mischievous, if he spreads, what face is living in the aristocratic circle? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I do what you say, my XX is the biggest fool!" Borak swears indignantly, "damn swindler!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
