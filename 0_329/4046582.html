			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the long and long melody, Lucifer appeared in front of a cello, he just turned around slightly, playing the sound of a man like a man, and The violin that lost its support floated in the air and was inexplicably inexplicable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immersed in the romantic atmosphere of a rounded cello and a light violin questioning each other, Natasha recalls her acquaintance with Lucien because of a "The Symphony of Destiny", the fate of the two people has the first tie, and because of the common hobby of music, Lucien's easy-going humorous name and his occasional distressed liking state, he gradually became friends with him, the more The more he found out the advantages of music besides music, calm and calm, gentle and mellow, smart and fun, and he had no pressure to get along with him, and he was free to be himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a beautiful life like the March and April scenery, maybe in this deepening friendship, I forgot the name of Lucien, The feelings that will arise in the future have laid the groundwork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a relaxed and melodic melody, Lu Xien’s instrument behind the harp and other instruments around him sounded from the ground and alternated with his violin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These instruments are like souls that have become the ensemble of the symphony orchestra, as if there is a transparent musician working with Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the effect of magic, Lucien played the feeling of a small symphony orchestra. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft violin is once again "standing" with the majestic cello, the hidden affection, the feelings of parting in the clear, clearly appear in Natasha's heart, It was a farewell after a period of life and death and mutual support. Lu Xien was about to leave Aalto and go to Holm. Although he believed that there would be opportunities to meet in the future, he also considered the development of Lucien and generously and decisively. Waving, but my heart will inevitably have some thoughts that have not yet been separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe at that time, when Lucien was firmly carrying his own shuttle in the Black Forest, friendship had an initial qualitative change, due to Silvia The harm caused and the neglect of self-cognition are just the feelings of being good friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the copper tube sound, the gloomy melody emerges, and the emotions of grief, fear, jealousy, sadness, etc. flow out in the balance between the violin and the band Allegro, Nata Shah felt that Lucien felt the hesitation, pain and embarrassment after he liked himself. It also emerged from all the hardships in the monastery. The only comfort is the letter from Lucien, which is farther and farther away on the magic road. He, who repeatedly made the Holy Scriptures and the Holy Scriptures shameful, and himself as a devout believer and a future female grandfather, seems to be difficult to continue with good friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violin reveals a firm and sorrowful anger, Natasha seems to hear the sigh of Lucien’s determination, and he has overcome many psychological obstacles, as always Regarding Lucien as his best friend, but the pressure of the church, the pressure of the Principality, the pressure of the father, the pressure of the Violet family, the pressure of the subjects, all cast a shadow, they are like a wave The violent storm hits, indicating a possible tragic ending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-examining, Natasha discovered that from that time on, she regarded Lucien as the most peaceful and gentle part of her heart, only for a long time. Habits have cast a layer of fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien continued to sing the violin, and the cello slowly moved when he was not indulged, as if listening to the violin’s euphemism. Then, Lucien turned to the cello, and the violin was windless and automatic, as if he had reached the stage of men's deep affection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives Natasha a beautiful scene in which the two men have determined their mind after Holm’s meeting, sweet but not greasy, warm and eternal, can be like this The affectionate taste has not lasted for a long time, and the melody has turned sharply. It seems that Holm’s situation, the danger of a year later, the worry of the father who is far away from Waorit has become a rushing note, which constitutes a sorrowful desire. Absolute scenes, before more embody the beautiful melody of love in such an atmosphere reveals the sadness that makes the soul cry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of mourning and grief is what Natasha once had, but the emotional experience of Silvia is not so strong. When she thought that she and Lucian would fall to such an ending, it seemed to empathize with the music that was sad to the depths of the soul. She clenched her fists and vowed to break everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if the father is obstructed, is the helpless choice for Lucien’s safety? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s face was a bit distorted, like a struggle in her heart. When her grief reached its strongest level, she finally took a step. No matter what difficulties she had, she hoped that she would never see hope. Time can only go forward, work hard to solve the problem, until death! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be infected by the firmness of her heart. After the strong sorrow, the flute once again plays the soft melodies of Qing Yue Hua Cai, with the harp of the harp, Na In front of Tasha, there seems to be a pair of sorrows, only a beautiful paradise mountain view, then the violin once again sings the theme melody, this time there is no faint grief, only the smoothness of the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of atmosphere is like the hands that have been handed over to each other after the vicissitudes of the world. As with the difficulties of fighting, there is no need to say anything about the warm eyes, like two But the butterflies broke free from the thick shackles that bound them, and the beautiful and dreamy wings danced around them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The music stops here, but the melody seems to linger in the room, making it beautiful and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the style of music I have never heard before, and the most beautiful violin melody I have ever heard. Thank you for your oyster gift, thank you for the 'Lusien Symphony The performance of the group.” After a long time, Natasha’s voice was slightly hoarse. “I like the last paragraph most, it seems to make the whole music sublimated.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lu Xien considered again and again, he chose He Zhanhao, Chen Gang's "Liang Zhu" violin concerto, although this is a tragic story, it seems that the meaning is not good, but the "Hua Butterfly" section is a good blessing, change You can perfectly express the feelings you want to talk about, and you can understand the situation between yourself and Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the violin down, Lucien stood up and said: "I am honored to get your love."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"I noticed that you have made a lot of tricks when you play the violin, such as using only two strings." Natasha smiled and walked to Lucien, took him back to the table and sat on the stool. See him asking for an answer, and quickly signaling not to continue, he continued: "It is rare to see you playing the violin. It is totally different from the charm of playing the piano. But now is not the time, the music just let me revisit and I have examined the feelings of our feelings, which makes me feel uncomfortable. I just want to have you and really feel you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughs "Today is your oyster, you are Her Majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiles a bit of bad intentions: "Yes? That's good, this is also I think, today is my oysters, everything is led by me, you can only accept, can not refuse, I did not let you do it, you Can't have any action, understand?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien just wants to answer, Natasha added: "Reassure, you will not violate your bottom line, in fact, I always wanted to turn you into a girl, just want to 'love' you, 'bullying' you, but now this state should be OK, and even more of a feeling of conquest, you are willing to cooperate "I?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled: "Today you are the Queen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Natasha smirked: "For me, music is a good gift for oysters, but the best oysters are the same, that is you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; While saying that she picked up a piece of cream from the table, wiped it in Lucine’s throat, and then slammed it up, and when Lucien wanted to reach out and hug her, her voice hoarsely stopped: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can't move, everything listens to the command."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The messy velvet was covered with two naked bodies, and the atmosphere of love filled the air. Lucien felt that he had the foresight and changed the enchanted big bed, which did not feel the collapse again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the most beloved child, Natasha clasped Lucien with her hands and feet, breathing smoothly, her eyebrows wrinkled and fell into In the dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She has been leading for a few hours before, and should be exhausted." Lucien's right hand was put on Natasha's right hand, and his left hand stretched out and outlined. Her outline, smoothing the faint worry between the eyebrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
