			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is quiet, the new cemetery is getting colder and the breeze is blowing, enough to make people shudder, so the loud collapse of the wind is far away with the wind, in Oliver When he was dizzy and full of foul smell, the corpse in the "Tombler" hut had already rushed over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, his roaring sound will stun the Oliver awoke: "damn bastard, see what you do! Tonight you fill it out Not here, I will fill you in! x!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He swears, scornfully confronts the confused Oliver and then looks at Oliver. Spit, and turned back to the hut. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smudged spit in the middle of Oliver’s forehead, he was almost sick and vomiting, but soon he almost became real, his mouth opened and he was facing the side Spit vomiting, the food of the day was all sprayed out, and even the bile came up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he found himself covered in corpse water and sticky rotten meat, his left hand was holding a half-stomach stomach, and his right hand was holding a strong Leg bones. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of scene is more resentful than any nightmare, making people sick and sick! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver is busy throwing the intestines, stomach pockets, leg bones, etc., holding his breath, resisting the odor, rotten smell, etc., which are many times more than usual. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the light blue light flashed away, attracting his gaze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咦..." Oliver is a keen senser, looking at the past from the angle of sight, and suddenly found that the leg bones split a lot of small There is a gap in the gap, and there is a faint blue glow inside the gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curious, expecting him to forget the dirty and stinking, forgetting his own situation, and even the movements become gentle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He carefully moved to the side of the leg and slowly picked it up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is really a blue glow overflowing inside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver has experienced many hardships. At this time, there was no direct inspection of what was going on. Instead, I followed several corpses and climbed to the edge of the grave. I looked around and confirmed that no one had to open the surface of the leg bones along a small gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The light of the blue water like the lake will be dyed nearby, and the dreams will be blurred. Slowly, a light blue short stick will appear in Oliver's hands. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This, what is this?" Oliver half-opened his mouth and couldn't figure out where he was. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thought he raised was to hide this wand that was worth a lot of value, so as not to be discovered by George and other corpses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the property found on the body must be handed over to George, who is uniformly assigned and honors the town hall officials and pastors who are in charge of the new cemetery. Therefore, Oliver’s valuable things discovered from the hidden body of the corpse were robbed by George. Even his salary was not used by George to deduct the money he bought for his money. He only guaranteed him two days a day. The stubborn fruit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver just wanted to bury the short stick nearby. When there is hope to escape in the future, I will dig it out and exchange for money, but suddenly I find that the light blue crystal is like a seaweed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a teenager who is interested in the career of drama. Oliver had been studying various languages ​​since childhood and learning the customs and cultures of different countries. Therefore, he recognized this as the language of the Hillsanas, one of the three common languages ​​of the ancient magical empire! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it weren’t for the information given by Mrs. Audrey, I would like to know a few words in this regard..." Oliver turned inexplicably at the moment. Thoughts, after reading a few sentences, I found the correct reading order and found that this turned out to be a "meditation idea", and at the end recorded the location where the owner of the scepter hides his treasure! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"''fire feng shui' element meditation. The magician's meditation?" Oliver also heard a lot of bard's story, watching the drama inside There is no shortage of evil magicians who persecuted the nobility and civilians, and were eventually defeated by the clergy and the nobility. Therefore, there is speculation on the source of "Mental Thoughts". "Is it a magician who inscribed his treasure on the staff before he died, and then hid in his body, or in the thighs of other people's bodies... Maybe, Maybe he has been burned to death by the night watchman... Maybe he wants to leave it to someone specific, but that person has never been there..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But everything he encountered in Rentatt made him suspicion of the Lord from the heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the Lord not protect me when I suffered such a misery? Why is the Lord's shepherd colluding with villains like George? Why are clergy, nobles, and wealthy people buried in graves with separate graves and shackles, and even if the poor are religious and devout, the bodies can only be thrown into such graves? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the justice of the Lord? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, why can't I use the magician's means to get rid of the current predicament? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as no one knows in the future, as long as I become a rich man, I am the most devout believer of the Lord. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essence, resistance, and other emotions are struggling in Oliver’s heart. The church-like education that he received from childhood has finally chosen to hide the short stick and wait for the pastor to meet. When the night watchman uses it for help, escape the tragic world. After all, once he becomes a magician, he will either fall into the church's endless pursuit, or worry about life all day long. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hiding a short stick next to the tombstone and leaving a special sign, Oliver limped to the collapsed grave, and got tonight Fill it in, otherwise it will be embarrassing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, I can’t sleep tonight..." Oliver’s thoughts just started, and suddenly there was a huge force coming from behind, letting him rise and fall. When I got to the mud, I felt pain and my back was especially bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You tmd's slacker, haven't worked yet! Want me to kill you? x!" The murderer Goodson cursed While punching and kicking against Oliver, he felt like he was dying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver can only protect his head with his hands in the experience of his previous experience, and the shrimps are as tired as the body, letting the fists and toes fall like raindrops. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, the corpse Gudson seemed to be tired and gasped for a few more times: "Get up and work! Otherwise I will take you Throw it down!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He waited for Oliver to answer and staggered to the gravekeeper's hut. He did not see Oliver's expression, staring at the front and staring at the tombstone with a special logo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you continue to do this, you will die sooner or later, and you will die anyway. I am going to pull you together! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly climbed up, walked to the tombstone, dug out the short stick, hid in the grave and carefully read it again, remembering the content. And then hide it in the chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he climbed out of the grave, picked up the shovel that Gudson had left, and sprinkled the soil into the grave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been done for half an hour. He carried the shovel and his face faintly rushed to the "Tomblin" lodge. The pace was very light, and he seemed to be afraid of waking up the "buried man" Goodson. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the hut, Goodson asked vaguely: "Are you done?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It’s too fast, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This shovel is a bit blunt, I change it." Oliver's voice was intermittent. It looks timid and shrinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodson snorted and said: "When you finish your work, remember to grind both shovel."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can't afford ironware, which was issued by the City Hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well." Oliver had already walked behind Goodson when he spoke. The light of the silver moon shines on Oliver through the empty window without glass and window paper, so that he is dyed with a layer of silver, so that the opposite wall highlights a black figure that lifts the iron shovel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shovel fell heavily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodson’s screams were only half-sounding, and then he came to an abrupt end. He didn’t think of it, the rich boy who loves life, the unworthy fool. Juvenile, the guy who is timid like a mouse who knows how to lie to a girl, dare to fight himself directly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
