			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serenade was originally an instrumental or singer that stood in the night and told the lover about love, but as the nobles liked and chased the music, and at the banquet, The dance and the various celebrations to entertain and entertain guests, the meaning of which represents some changes, musicians began to cater to the social needs of the nobility to create music, making serenade, nocturne and light suite more and more social and Entertainment, no longer have a difficult structure and content, nor have their own ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Aalto’s orthodox musicians, although they will create some banquet-style serenade for their “sponsors,” are still more discussed. Elegant music, or "real" serenade that expresses love and certain emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvia, who just talked with Lucien and others about the characteristics of the piano, smiled and smiled at Christopher while waiting for the indoor band to prepare. "Teacher, I have seen this Julian's work in your study. The serenade of the five rigorous movements has to admit that it may be influenced by the style of the Tria Palace. It is brisk. Beautiful and lively, it is very suitable for this banquet occasion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher shook his head with a smile after hearing the words of Silvia:" You..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he showed this expression is because Silvia’s words are not really praise, even if she is very subtle, Surrounded by highly authoritative music literacy, how can we not understand her meaning: Julian's works are only suitable for banquet occasions, too warm and brisk, but frivolous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, orthodox musicians such as Othello and Victor just smiled and did not respond to Silvia, after all, Barry and Clement’s companions of Julian also Nearby. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Barre and Clement are the first time to come to Aalto, although I have heard the teacher Fernan Sova talk about Aalto’s musical atmosphere before, but no They really felt that Silvia was praising their companions, so they were obsessed with the beauty of Silvia, and they smiled passionately at Silvia, while secretly glaring at Julian. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This lady is really subtle." Lucien barely understood the meaning of Silvia, probably because he was a music consultant for Natasha. So, let Silvia "love the house and the Ukrainian" and have no good feelings for Julian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This style of serenade has no hard content. After reading the score twice and trying to play a few melody, the band signaled that Julian could start. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julian took the violin and became the chief himself, ready to play and coordinate the conductor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A solemn beginning sounds, and Christian musicians such as Christopher and Victor are looking at Julian with strangeness and doubt. This is not a common serenade style! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although many musicians used similar techniques, they were not successful and have been rare recently! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s face is more intense, she likes not to be bound by the old-fashioned creation, and Silvia converges with a smile, slightly Pouting and listening to Julian's next performance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julian is worthy of being a talented musician at the court of Tria, and the following performances show an unusual momentum, with a strong symphony and sonata style. The melody not only highlights the warm atmosphere of celebrations and banquets, but also expresses the congratulations and respect for Felice, and there is no other superficial like serenade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the movement ended and entered the soothing second movement, most musicians couldn’t help but nod, and Christopher smiled and praised: "The creation of this movement is very important to Julian's musical background, full of elegant style."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clement, Barre enviously watching the performance Julian, can get a compliment from Christopher, Julian has capital to enter the ranks of real musicians and show off at the Tria Palace for at least ten years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following elegance and slowness is the dance passage of two consecutive movements, designed specifically for this kind of banquet, and finally into the fast-paced tail chapter, in joy The end of the climax of passion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applause sounded enthusiastically, and Felice expressed her gratitude to Julian as the owner of the rite of birth: "Mr. Julian, thank you for the serenade, it is similar style. A rare piece of quality."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are many places in the band due to the strangeness of the band, it is impossible to cover up the success of the music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKantz greeted him and smiled and praised: "Gorgeous, elegant, warm, it is hard to imagine a similar serenade than this." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said the last half of the sentence, but his face was looking at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not care about this, but applauded to express his respect for the beautiful music, and he is not a real musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Julian, your work fully reflects the most fascinating part of the serenade." Othello, as a member of the association, also expressed to Julian’s serenade. For sure, this is the attitude of most musicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, quietly Wenwen’s Silvia smiled and said: “But it also has the most distinctive flaws of serenade, in order to cater to such occasions, It seems to be dragged, loose and monotonous in many paragraphs, and the overall structure is also very unsatisfactory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This angelic lady, what you said It is a problem that can't be avoided by Serenade." Julian reluctantly replied with a smile, and the feeling of warmth and joy was like being poured a cold water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a teacher of Silvia, Christopher shook his head again with helplessness, and his gentle, quiet and peaceful students showed a bit sharp today, so The occasion was not to write a review article in the newspaper, so he took the words of Silvia with a harmonious smile: "No matter what, Julian's work has surpassed most of the serenade of similar style, in performance There is a certain depth in power."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julian can't help himself, revealing a pleasant smile, President Christopher's evaluation is so high, he finally Can you be famous in Aalto and in the whole continent? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of evaluation makes Barre and Clemente full of embarrassment, even the appearance of McCannz is very complicated, I feel that I specifically invite Julian Is the move too owed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your evaluation, Mr. Christopher." Julian said with excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he turned and looked at Lucien: "The next thing should be your performance, Mr. Evans? I am looking forward to your serenade. "The whole person has become arrogant." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other musicians saw this scene and shook their heads secretly: "Surely most geniuses are embarrassed."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp At this time, in front of the hall, Felice’s mother was in a good mood and said with a bright smile: “Today is Felice’s adulthood, and her classmate Lucien Evans will send her The last serenade is a gift for oysters. Ladies and gentlemen, I think you should not have heard of Evans, the outstanding musical genius? Hey, if you haven’t heard of this magnificent and magnificent You can say that you haven’t heard any music in your life.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latter sentence, she deliberately made the sound old and humorously imitated Started Christopher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applause of the guests screamed enthusiastically, whether it was good or bad, they were very curious, because they had never heard of Lucien, the musical genius who played himself. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when Natasha was in the music discussion, she completely listened to Lucian’s playing melody several times, knowing that Lucien’s blood power was used for piano playing. Have a mastery of mastery and full of style. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien sorted out his clothes and prepared to go to the direction of the band. The voice of Silvia was slightly said: "Don’t let Natasha disappoint, you are Her music consultant."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, I am looking forward to your serenade." Julian repeated again with a little provocatively, if Lucien The piano pieces failed, and in contrast, their reputation will be even louder, and there is nothing more wonderful than defeating a recognized, superior musical genius. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKantz even smiled lowly: "Lu Xien, don't play the wrong character, I heard that you can't even play the piano." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien ignored him, although the music was not his own creation, but playing the piano is now a true ability of his own, so the smile encouraged by Victor, Rheinland In the expectation of lifting the wine glass forward, in the warm applause, calmly leave the circle of musicians and go to the band. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
