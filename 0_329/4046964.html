You have to try every possible one, and combine the different components of each material. This is not successful without thousands or tens of thousands of modulations. ..." Douglas answered very seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young magician pulled a face and pointed to the side: "The magic book says that scarlet grass plus fisheyes and dead soul wood tubers have a stimulating spirit. The role, this is the combination of their natural effects, is the summary of the hard work of the past magicians, is the law of nature, is the truth that will be established without doubt! My pharmacy is not for sale, please go somewhere else!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it’s just been separated from the teachings of teachers and magic books, although the young magician hates this messy guy, he still reluctantly The "principle" of the recipe is said again, of course, the specific component combination is confidential. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas nodded, and when the young magician looked up, he suddenly said, "I know that 'scarlet plus fisheye and dead soul wood tubers' have Stimulating the role of mental growth, this is the law of experience, but why is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando behind him resisted the smile, looking To the side, I almost whistled and watched the madness of Douglas-style "why", which made him feel very interesting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression of the young magician is enough to be stunned, after a few words in the throat. Turning directly to the head, looking at the nearby mage, muttered: "It's a weirdo!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the magicians of the past have summed up most of the materials The gain and restraint, and the interpretation of different genres, such as the four elements said in the magic of medicinal refining, such as the principle of life cycle, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young magicians know a lot, and individuals are more inclined to explain based on the principle of the four elements, but he is not a stranger in front of him. I am afraid that I will explain it afterwards. There will also be a bunch of "why", which makes him feel awkward, just like a tough teacher can not give a satisfactory answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding magicians are either gloomy or funny looking at this scene, for people who are not familiar with it. They have no intention of intervening. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas did not mind the other person blaming himself. I sincerely said: "You haven't read the book "The Crown of Magical Agents"? This may explain some of the reasons. And in practice, there are some proofs and applications, but they are still full of contradictions, I think Did not touch the essence of the problem."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young magician biting his teeth. Constantly chanting in my heart: "Don't ignore him, ignore him!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has a feeling of flying around hundreds of thousands of mosquitoes, as if by a dozen The druid from the forest was surrounded, which made him quite crazy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas does not ask "why", it belongs to the kind of people who are very reasonable. After a little returning to God, he smiled and shook his head: "I am against this." There is some research in the field of magical knowledge. If you are interested in the problem, you can talk to me. My name is Douglas. I am a 'sorcerer union'. Who are you?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;############################################################################################################################# <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the most talented of our generation of young mage, but have long been immersed in magic research and book learning, and communication and communication with people is not very good, this time we Going to Allinge to participate in the magic organization's party represents the image of the entire 'shadow singer', so I have to remind you that you can't be too weak, too arrogant, and pay attention to politeness..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courtesy Courtesy... The young mage with linen hair bluntly replies: "I am Owen of the 'Shadow Singer'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I looked, your The pharmacy should be good.” Douglas didn’t bother Owen and left his “stall” with interest, which made Owen breathe a long sigh of relief. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas smiled and didn't say anything. He carefully observed the magicians gathered in the square. They came from different organizations, ranging from medium to high. There were men and women, cheerful and gloomy, handsome and beautiful. There are also horror and horror. The only thing in common is that they have a touch of repression, fear and sorrow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a bad thing happening, but the long-term survival has brought irreversible changes to their hearts, naturally also reflected in the external Above the temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The skin of the Blue Dragon, hiding dozens of patterns of spells, can effectively improve the level of the corresponding magic!" Walking, the two suddenly heard A crisp female voice is selling the "blue dragon skin." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blue Dragon is a kind of dragon, famous for its lightning and water superiority. Its skin is not only the alchemy material, but also the focus of the magician research. After all, From the stage of the birth of magic, the magicians invented many spells by imitating the supernatural body surface and the pattern in the body as the main research method. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when Douglas and Fernando followed the sound, the girl’s "stall" was already "stacked" full of magicians, all silently The incomplete "blue dragon skin" seems to measure the price he is willing to pay in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Fernando, who is good at lightning storm spells, the "Blue Dragon's Skin" is especially precious, so he didn't say Douglas, just walk a few steps to the girl's booth. After confirming the authenticity of the material, you can directly say: "What do you need? What do you need to change with the blue dragon skin?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other magicians are slightly dissatisfied Looking at Fernando, who was forced to squeeze in, there was still no one to say, and I wanted to hear the girl’s plan. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This girl has a long, linen-colored hair, her pupils are similar in color, beautiful and youthful, and she smiles crisply: "I want to use it." Can you do it for the demise of the Church of Truth?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Fernando’s roar. She ended the joke at the right time: "I need all the basic magic books in the middle, focusing on deformation, ** transformation and blood fusion, do you have it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She The answer was vague, apparently intended to pick the most satisfying book from the magician present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes!" Fernando has always been an temper, immediately took out a lot of books from the storage bag, and let them float in the air, then looked provocatively The magician around, a "rogue look" that "I have to fix it, you have the ability to hit me." The magicians next to the <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were a bit annoyed first, but soon someone whispered: "He is Fernando of the Union."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the referee's Fernando?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After killing the 'hunter" Fernando?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magicians suddenly whispered. Many people who are planning to compete with Fernando are ready to back down. He is a celebrity, not only very strong, but also ruthless, action decisive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando did not expect his name to be so "sounding". When I first entered the "Purifier" sequence, I have not seen it with this kind of vision. This made him a bit confusing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How? Are you satisfied with the books I took out?" Fernando decided to leave the rest of the people. Directly ask the girl with long linen hair. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, a five-minded ordinary, can not see the age of the magician stood up: "What about Fernando? Today's major organizations meet. He Can you directly grab the items that are normally traded?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando looked at the magician and was about to roar. The girl who sold the thing suddenly said: "I switched to Mr. Fernando, he is my hero! For more than 100 years, he was the first magician who dared to attack the referee directly and killed the hateful 'hunters and traitors!'<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time it’s Fernando’s turn to be stunned. When did the “famous” have the effect of buying and selling bonuses? This little girl still retains a little innocent feelings? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
