			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangerous atmosphere flashed away, it seems to be the illusion of Lucian, but the "Hands of Congas" in the left hand is reminding him that there is indeed The strong is close. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien..." Aphrodite saw Lucien stay there, just about to speak, but was stopped by the gesture of his right hand, so The translucent eyes are not clear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this sensitive situation, there are still people coming to this small church in the civilian area of ​​the city. What is his purpose? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, Lucien couldn’t sense the dangerous atmosphere anymore, so he used Afraud with little fluctuations to tell Aphrodite: "Someone was approaching, at least advanced, and now it seems to be sneaking into the Redemption Church. Let's wait, we can't let Richard go wrong."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aff When Reston was excited, did you have an enemy? Having an enemy means victory, and victory means loot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raise the claws, and Aphrodite wiped the saliva from his mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard stood quietly before the cross, thinking about The dialogue, the buds that have been hidden for more than 20 years seem to gradually sprout under the sun, and the chaotic and contradictory ideas in the past have been clarified a little bit, reshaping their own beliefs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, he is calm and prays with enthusiasm: "If the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures violates your teachings and will, then Let the light devour me, that means my faith is shaken by the fallen morning star, and will break into hell."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drip, time is like water, one minute As the second passed, Richard slowly covered a layer of sacred and solemn radiance, like a saint who received the grace of the gods. He raised his head, opened his eyes, painted a cross on his chest, his eyes were gentle and firm, and his voice was low. "You are one, but also 10,000. It is the beginning and the end. I think I understand your teachings, God loves the world, redeems the world, and the existence of religion is to defend the faith, not to block the faith. Everyone has a The right to revelation in the Holy Scriptures, as long as the soul is pious, can get the shine of your spiritual name."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard's physical and mental pleasure, that makes you confused and confused The dirt of twenty or thirty years seems to be evaporated one by one under the holy light, and the faith is more determined and pious. Let jointly bottleneck for decades strength seems to touch the nine door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is your gift, only the truth will last forever." Richard painted the cross on the sacred emblem of his chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, from the perspective of Lucien, the devotion of Richard’s faith and his study of theology, without long-term confusion and embarrassment, You can be promoted to the ninth level, and maybe you have become a pastor of the Holy Spirit and entered the legendary field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard got up from his seat, indicating that the pastor and the bishops in the church could end their prayers and leave, and they went to the garden next to them, breathing in the fresh air of the night. The floral fragrance, feeling the beauty of life, thinking about the religious reform program that I want to propose, and all this is given by the God of truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether the road ahead is dangerous, and then suppressed by the members of the Pope and the Cardinal, I will also complete the program and submit it to the Cardinal and distribute it to others." The clergyman.” Richard did not read the idea, but also pinned his hopes on the reforms within the church. Suddenly, he turned back intently and saw a red dress wearing a red robe and a square cap. The bishop smiled and walked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oktaf?" Richard recognized this as a talent he developed while he was in charge of the Rantat Monastery. He was previously responsible for the religion of Holm Parish. The cardinal of the referee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oktaf is a very majestic middle-aged man with thick black eyebrows and a pair of sharp, pale blue eyes. He smiles: "You should I heard about the recent events, I was a little embarrassed, so I thought of asking you to open a solution."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is resentment in my heart, so I will blind my eyes?" Richard Asked by the verses of the Holy Scriptures, the expressions and embarrassment are very comforting. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oktafu painted the cross on his chest: "Yes, I am worried that I have been blinded by resentment, forgetting the original intention of serving the Lord, and being abandoned by the Lord. However, Mr. Richard, can we let the evil sway in front of us, but for all kinds of reasons tolerate it, is this not abandonment of the Lord's teachings?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also recited the verses of the Holy Scriptures, his face revealing a little questioning look, questioning himself, and questioning the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard shook his head: "What is evil? Where are the nobles you killed evil?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He listens to the Voice of Mystery, and he works with the magician to make money." Octave sounds high. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard pointed to the Holy Scriptures in his hands: "The Lord only tells us not to be greedy, not to lie, not to indulge, not to ignore life, Don't be filled with pain and hatred. Does the nobleman fail to do it?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He lied! Weave lies and cooperate with the magician." Octave Subconsciously answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled: "The lying person will not be able to ascend to the mountain of heaven, in the earth, and be hurt by the lightning flame... this is the Lord's The punishment did not say that they could ignore their lives."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He works with the magician to hear the voice of mystery!" Oktaf did not understand Richard's thoughts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard is very peaceful: "The Holy Scriptures have not said that you can't cooperate with a magician, as long as this magician does not violate the teachings of the Holy Scriptures. The evil man."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How could it not be evil, "The Holy Scriptures..." Oktaf recited the contents of the Holy Scriptures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richard smiled at him and saw that he stopped his words: "Since you follow the Holy Scriptures, consider the will of the church." And the idea, why do you feel resentful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oktafu’s face is very beautiful: "Yes, it’s not the church, not the "Christian". It is the high and high ground that violates the original intention of the faith, and has repeatedly revised the "Teaching Code" and yours. They have turned away from the Lord and can no longer effectively spread the faith of the Lord. Mr. Richard, you have not always disliked the Pope. Amend the Holy Scriptures? I hope that you can stand up and appeal to other clergy in the Holm parish to awaken their numb souls and jointly propose to the Pope to restore the original "Teach of the Holy Scriptures."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the Pope is not willing?" Richard has just experienced a lobbying, so he is very keenly aware of the weirdness in Octave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he doesn't want to, we will choose the real, representative of the will of the Lord. I think many Cardinal members have similar views!" "Oktaf is slightly excited and fanatical. "In my heart, you are such a candidate!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not be used, we are correct The practice is to return the right to interpret the Holy Scripture to every devout believer, justified by faith!” Richard shook his head and rejected Octath’s invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t expect Richard’s thoughts to be more radical than myself, Oktaf stunned, and then began to persuade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard, who has just strengthened his faith, is like a stone that does not advance in oil and salt. The opinions that do not conform to his own reform agenda are not accepted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Oktaf bowed his head in frustration: "Then I will leave, I hope that you will be able to figure it out in the future. We welcome you to join us at any time." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We? Richard frowned, seeing Oktaf had turned and left, no more to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing Oktaf stepping into the cloister, Richard carried his hands and continued to perfect his reform agenda. At the end of the cloister, Octave suddenly stopped, his face showing a hint of sly smile, and he did not know when there was more of a terrorist force. Brown reel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead people are often more easily used by living people because they can't talk!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Richard, who died in the hands of a magician, is more likely to stir up conflict than Richard, who is alive!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scroll was torn open by him, eternal The power suddenly broke out, and Richard and the area around him immediately became infected with the gray of nothingness. Under the "time stop" of the nine-ring magic, everything seemed to be still. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine-ring magic "big cracking"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Octave took out the last magic scroll "The Ultimate Destruction Ball", he suddenly saw a figure in front of him, facing I am a finger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, the artifacts of Octave are all broken, the cardinal robe is turned into a different color of light, and even the flesh is "evaporated" "A mist of various elements." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the defense, he was immediately hurt, and his body and soul seemed to be in a stiff position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s “Elemental Order” is more perfect after the new alchemy has initially explained the outer electronic exchange, and the power is enhanced again, using the strength of the seven rings. It also has a nearly nine-ring effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the "Salvation Church" sacred mask masks most of the magical fluctuations, Lucien, who is close at hand, recognizes the nine-ring magic, so he shot Rescue, but only because of the use of legendary magic will certainly break through the barrier of the magical array, let Lentat's legendary strong sense, so did not display. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Octave used a wasteful move of two nine-ring reels to make Lucien hate, high-end reels are much rarer than alchemy items because they can carry There are not many materials for high-level magic, and there are fewer paper scrolls, and the scroll of the last name is comparable to the alchemy items that can be used repeatedly. Unless it can only be made into a scroll, the magician would rather look for more. Materials to refine the goods, even Lu Xien, the "monopoly" body now has no high-order and above reels, Octave is simply using money to curse! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien once again pointed his hand, he used the spell to lower the magical anti-surname of Octave, and then used petrification to make him a statue. Take it back and slowly torture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a figure suddenly burst out of the shadows, and the long sword in his hand took the taste of eliminating extraordinary power, and then he found out that he couldn’t catch up with Lucien. Body. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oktaf has a companion who has the "Knight" to "eliminate" the blood! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, he is also an "acquaintance" of Lucien, who had been the night watchman of the Aalto referee! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason, Lund, who has been promoted to the sixth-class knight, recognizes Lucien’s identity, and with his will, he can’t help but rejoice. If you are crazy, will you finally kill this abominable enemy? He believes that under his own blood, Lucien's spell trigger ratio will be lifted! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sword went to Lu Xien, but like a bubble, Lu Xi Junya’s face slowly dissipated with a strange smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oops, illusion!" Lund’s heart tightened, and he quickly returned to the sword defense, and a giant behemoth suddenly emerged behind him, translucent amber eyes focused And looking at him seriously, his mouth opened, and a cold and numb dragon spurted out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure from the top creatures makes Lund a little lost. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vicinity of Octave, Lucien appeared, and rushed to the eight-level cardinal who had just returned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oktaf recognizes that Lucien used "Ball's Transfiguration", and his heart subconsciously laughed, and a magician turned into a knight. Isn't this a short-term evasion? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he laid a defense defense in front of him, ready to stop the attack and then launched a counterattack, as long as he can escape, it will smear Richard De and "fallen angels" colluded! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left hand clenched the fist, swayed out, the faint silver moon light mixed with the black and white gray solidified flash, Octave's eyes rounded, and suddenly saw his defense Under Lucien’s left fist, the paper was broken. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am dreaming?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the horror, Octaph was beaten on the side by Lucien's left fist, suddenly his teeth flew, blood squirting, and directly fainted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
