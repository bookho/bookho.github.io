			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright and bright yellowish carriage, soft and clean brown-red seat, crystal clear magic glass, and the beauty of the two wearing light blue dresses The girls, let Lucien feel good about the magic steam train. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to the 'Klaus' magic steam train, this train will take seven stops and arrive in Aringe in three hours." The two girls sang in good manners. "Respect the guests. If you have any needs, please press the magic button on the table."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien As a guest, just smile and let Lazar make arrangements. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar took out the pocket watch from the double-breasted black long dress lined pocket and looked at the time: "It’s a little afternoon, it’s all in the parliament headquarters. The staff arrived before the break. Yes, you still haven't used lunch? The magic steam train is equipped with chefs who are well versed in the dishes of various countries. You are welcome, this trip is paid by the parliament. Of course, you will give it yourself, the ticket fee It’s a Quintal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“A Jintal?” Not only the apprentices, but Lu Xi’an was a little surprised, a middle-income civilian It was only seven or eight Jintales in the year, which is many times more expensive than the previous generation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the expression of "bandits", Lazar couldn’t help but smile: "In fact, the idea of ​​the magic steam train was very early. They are inspired by the devices on the mine. They can be driven entirely by the magical array and alchemy life. They are very expensive in terms of materials and energy supply. The magicians above the middle level can basically fly by themselves, so the magic steam train is posted. The gorgeous but not applicable logo was sealed up until the legendary magician of Alchemy, who used the magic and mechanical means to make the steam engine, which greatly reduced the cost of running the train."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this way, the magic steam train is not only the speed of the middle-level magician himself or by flying on items such as konjac, but also the number of people who can ride and the goods carried. The airship is nearly a hundred times more expensive and the cost is lower. Therefore, the planning of the magic railroad and the magic steam train was re-introduced by the parliament. Four lines have been laid. From Padre Harbour to Allinge, this is Early piece "<br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; while introducing, Lazar aside to let Lucien and apprentices meal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Lazar, since the cost has been greatly reduced, why is the ticket cost so expensive?" Sprint asked curiously, the apprentice was his most Be bold and dare to ask questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar and Lucien sit on the soft chairs on both sides of the table and point around: "You also sit down, the train will start." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reason why it is so expensive is because the 'Klaus' is a luxury train that allows you to quickly reach Aringe while enjoying the advanced The service of the restaurant. If other magic trains, it is about 30 tickets of Yinnar. Of course, this is also very expensive. After all, the laying of other routes is jointly funded by the parliament headquarters and the ticket fare. In this case, We can't trust the greedy bankers."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After satisfying the curiosity of the apprentices, Lazar smiled and said to Lucien: "Wait After this mode of transportation has been promoted, the cost should be reduced. Evans, the Magic Council is a stage of rapid development, and all kinds of whimsy and incredible things are endless. It can be said that you are at the best of times. Don't let go of the opportunity, take the time to change your mind, learn arcane, For the 'real' magician!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task that can be assigned to meet the wizards and apprentices, Lazar is undoubtedly a cheerful and kind Enthusiastic young people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In fact, I started to learn the basics of Arcane in Mr. Astar, hehe, while studying and guiding three apprentices." Lucien Place the "Amora Staff" and the vigilant sword at the seat next to the seat for the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In more than a month of study, Annick and Reyia have become official magic apprentices, and Heidi is almost a bit faster. This matter and so on will be reported to the parliament as half of the task, so Lucian did not hide. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar gently nodded: "This is excellent, I hope to see Evans as soon as you get the official arcane level." Everyone omits their ignorance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wow, the magic steam train really ran." Sprint got up halfway and looked out the window. He couldn't believe that such a behemoth could act on his own. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affected by him, even if calm, such as Olmos, Annick could not help but look out the window and saw the platform a little back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they were surprised and excited to discuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Evans, you can hold your breath." Lazar saw Lucien pouring white water from the transparent kettle, and he didn't care about the magic steam train at all. So I moved the golden eyebrows with a slight compliment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien certainly can’t say that he saw more, and smiled lightly: “Because I am more curious about the operating principle of the magic steam engine, Lazar, I can go Have a visit?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar laughed: "No, I can understand Evans' curiosity, but this is a study of Lord Klaus. The result, if you want to know and learn, you can only go to the parliament to exchange relevant information with the Arcane Point."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The train is getting faster and faster, booming and jingling The collision sound gradually disappeared, and the abnormality was smooth and quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is the effect of the magical array?" Lucien looked at the window with a puzzled look, only to see the desolate fields and occasional country cottages in November. Fly back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road is to ask, the other side of the carriage, the two light blue dress girls pushed the dining car and came in, followed by a few a musician holding a violin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the melodious music, the two girls placed steak, grilled fish, caviar, and fried foie gras on their tables. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien paved the napkin, picked up the knife and fork and gently cut the next piece of veal into the mouth, full of juice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the delicious food disappeared in the mouth, Lucien nodded happily to Lazar: "The level of aristocratic chef."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, in fact, I have always been looking forward to the food of the ancient kingdom of Syrah, but unfortunately has not become a mid-level magician, it is difficult to fly through the storm strait." Lazar cut his own pan fried Foie gras, "Of course, Aalto's music is also very appreciated. But Evans, you know, because of the church's blockade, whether it's music or opera, we tend to postpone the Western continent for half a year to a year, and now it's just just popping up Evans. , Hey, the music of the great musician with the same name as you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien then discussed the specialties of various countries and heard Lazar’s eyebrows dance. Do not hesitate to introduce some of the Magic Council headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lazar, what are the ways to get the Arcane points? I can't wait to have a formal arcane level." Lucien asked the most concerned Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in the eyes of others, they just touched the arcane, Lucien intends to concentrate on learning the knowledge in the Magic Council for a while, and so on. After the theory, try to write a research paper, but from Lazar's speech, you can see that there are many benefits to getting a formal arcane level, so I want to see if there is a less noticeable way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for more than a month, Lucien used the "Brook Thoughts" to temper, the soul and spirit have reached the minimum standards of advance, within a few days Try to construct a two-ring magic in the soul to raise the level of magic, so you need a quiet environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar used a clean white napkin to wipe the corner of his mouth, funny: "Evans, I heard an old saying: the more you want to go faster It is often difficult for people to reach their destination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, the acquisition of arcane points is the most important thing for every magician, I can tell you first. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The achievement of Arcane points can only be assessed by the Parliament's 'Arcane Review Committee', which is affiliated with the highest scrutiny group, by magic The faction consists of fifty-two authorities, each with at least six levels of arcane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are so few magicians with levels above the sixth level. ?? Wayne was surprised to put down the knife and fork. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
