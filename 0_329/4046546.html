			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Tower of Holm is located in the aristocratic area. Lucien didn’t take long to get to the door, then removed the deformed mask and restored his appearance. Checked and entered inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is getting thicker, but the magic tower is more lively than any of Lucien’s arrivals, because the queen of the successor is from the city of the Holy Ghost, treating the magician It’s unclear whether the attitude will change or not, so safety is of the utmost importance. Some of the magicians who lived in Rantat went directly to Aringe with their families, while others hid with the relatives to Holm Royal. Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, after dinner, the magicians in the hall are walking or gathering, and from time to time can hear the laughter of children playing and seeing wearing A woman with a wide-brimmed hat and a veil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebecca is communicating with some of the elemental magicians about the most popular new alchemy system, and suddenly sees a black top hat The young man came in from the doorway, his eyes suddenly condensed, his voice jerked high, and he was astonished and surprised: "Good evening, Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lobby Inside, all the sounds disappeared, and they became silent. A gaze shifted to Lucien's body, and then they said: "Good evening, Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Their attitude is respectful, not like facing a young magician under the age of 25, but as if they have seen the legendary big man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is also keenly aware of the changes in the will of the element and the attitude of the Holm division magician, if the middle and lower level magicians see that they are Respect and yearning, that is now respect and worship, just like facing a legendary magician, facing the Arcanist, is this the effect of the new alchemy? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking at the first light-haired lady, Lucien nodded and said, "Long time no see, Rebecca."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her "mistakes" allowed Lucien to participate in the annual meeting of elements and alchemy, so that the periodic table papers were confirmed by Lavendi on the spot, so Lucy En was very impressed with her, and she had a very good relationship with Lazar. She often heard her name from Lazar's mouth, and maybe she became the wife of Lazar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You, you remember me, Mr. Evans?" Rebecca was surprised and delighted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and pointed to his head: "I have always remembered very well, and Lazar often mentioned you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know when he will be back." Rebecca is a bit worried about authenticity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After chatting a few words, Lucien smiled and said goodbye to the upper level of the Magic Tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at his back disappeared into the lift, other magicians were surrounded and whispered:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rebecca, how good is your relationship with Mr. Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a lot of questions and thoughts about new alchemy Can you help transfer to Mr. Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you ask Mr. Evans, does the atomic institute still need a magician?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebecca listened to their words, and suddenly felt a sense of vicissitudes of time change, initially heard of Lucien? The name Evans is a tribute to the great musicians when he appreciates the Symphony of Destiny. Later, he learned from the mouth of Lazar that there was a first paper that was highly praised and was drafted by two journals. The genius of the Arcane Master, but in this seven or eight years, the quiet and restrained young man created one record after another, and got one after another glory, is about to reach the highest peak in the field of arcane, and The big arcans together "appreciated the scenery of the high places." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but she is not embarrassed about this, because in the face of Lucien’s "monster", this raises one after another horror arcane that subverts the new theory of surname In the face of the great gap between the two sides, there is no such thing as a deep powerlessness and worship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the "new alchemy" system is different from the other achievements of Lucien in the past, always affirmed in the doubts and disputes, subverted a lot Human cognition has been ruined by countless smashes. It was seen as a spark of wisdom that illuminates the new world as soon as it was born, attracting the vast majority of magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has extremely important guiding significance for the magicians who are working hard in the deep darkness of the microscopic world, and integrates scattered discoveries. From then on, the exploration of this field will bid farewell to the blind stage, just like there is finally in the night. The stars are shining. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they also know that there are still many problems with the "new alchemy" that have not been solved yet, and there may be many mistakes, but this has undoubtedly opened the To the door of the creation field, illuminating the direction of the microcosm, Lucien will soon become a great arcian because of it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe one day, we are free to change things." A magician gave a heartfelt delight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other magician looked at the position of the lift, admired and admired the tunnel: "At that time, Mr. Evans' name will be the most dazzling in the history of magic. One of the names."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new heterosexual space is still being developed, Lavin’s first-class masters and high-ranking magicians only came back a part. After Lucien talked with them a few words, they walked into their office here, stood in front of the window and looked at Nexel Palace on the ground above the Milky Way. , opened the "communication glasses." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...hey, Lucien?" Natasha’s voice was a little tired, and her earrings were modified by Lucien to decipher the encrypted sound. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "Good evening, Her Majesty, looking at the information in the intelligence department and the secret collection room?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why he went to the Royal Tower of Holm to talk to Natasha was mainly to not expose himself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the priest of the Holy Spirit is not a magician, there is no way to crack his new encryption algorithm, not to mention the epic knight of Ketonia, but They can judge the source according to the direction of the induced electromagnetic wave. If you contact Natasha directly in Allinge, it is easy to doubt Natasha's true relationship with himself. In the Royal Tower of Holm, he can mislead others to Heather. Wei thought that the elders care about the younger generation is normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, although you have told me about the Kingdom of Holm in the past few years, they are all fragmented and fragmented. I need to go deeper and overall. "The grasp of Natasha." When Natasha spoke, there was a rustling of the paper, and then she laughed. "As the Queen's loyal knight, what do you think of Count Lucien Evans?"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knights of the Day are often awarded to the title of the Viscount or the Earl, so the high-level magician can also be analogous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "One of the nobles, the powerful aristocrats and the nobles who have mastered the key positions, talk to them, look for trustworthy and can Relying on the object, you are the queen, you naturally have the right to control them, don't worry about anything, right, after the funeral, begin to review the Knights of the Sword of Truth, the Order of the Knights and the Knights of the Holy Cross, and disrupt some of the teams. Regrouping, of course, the most important thing is to hurry up and improve your strength. The sooner you reach level 8, the sooner you take the legendary three-level sword of truth, the more you can take the initiative."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But what is trustworthy and can rely on?" Natasha smiled mockingly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien comforted: "This requires you to recognize your heart and beliefs. If you even want what you want, you want to change the Kingdom of Holm." If you don't know what it is, then there is no way to identify the enemy. However, there is no way to do this. You can play with the power of the right, and let the Kaiming and Conservatives oppose each other, from time to time, suppressing one side and maintaining balance, but this It is not a long-term solution. It is not suitable for this special place of the Holm Kingdom. After all, there is a church behind the conservatives. There is a parliament behind the enlightened faction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tasha replied that Lucian decided to stimulate her about the issue of faith: "According to the news from the Parliament, His Royal Highness Prince may have been murdered."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? Who is it!” Although Natasha felt that her grandfather and her father died in a coincidence, they themselves were on the verge of death. It was reasonable to die in a sad atmosphere. At this time, when I heard Lucien’s words, she was Unusual shock and anger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The suspicion is the heart of time, Ketonia shot, only his ability to change the time in a short period of time can make the prince down because of grief Death, and at the time, Thrad and Rex were in Nexus Palace." Lucian was a bit intolerant of Natasha's anger and sadness, but still cruelly finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
