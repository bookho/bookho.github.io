			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christophe quietly watched Lucien sing in the tsunami-like applause of the mountains, and smiled for a long time: "Victor and Rhein put the piano When I was transformed, I thought it was a brand new instrument. The volume was loud, the sound quality was full, and the contrast between the strong and the weak was very clear, but I never tried to write music for this new instrument. I never thought that I could not be in the past. The melody and skills on the harpsichord and the harpsichord can be displayed on the piano. The piano piece created by Lucien just added a lot of violin skills. It is very difficult, not like human beings can finish it. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For the Cavaliers, it only takes a while to practice." Verdi was surprised that the piano can be played like this, not the road. How difficult it is for Sean's skills, so after a short surprise, it returned to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled and smiled at Will at first glance: "The change in fingering skills is really nothing to us, but other ordinary musicians may need it. Long-term adaptation, because Lu Xien showed not only the dazzling of the fingering, but also the widening of the range width, strength and weakness of the piano sonata when composing, so that the music played by a piano also has the color of the symphonic surname. There is a feeling of a band, huh, I am more curious and confident about Lucien’s next "Sorrow"."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her words are simpler, let the surroundings The aristocrats who don't understand music know that the update of the instrument will bring about the change of music, and Lucien is at the forefront of everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I restrained my curiosity and didn't go to see Lucien's "Sorrowful" sheet music, but as I heard from Victor, Lucien really did. The genre, structure, and technique of the piano sonata have undergone a great degree of change. Oh, it seems that I am really old. I concentrate on the writing of Twilight War and I have not studied the piano well.” Christopher humorously laughed at himself. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Duke of Ouolette followed with a smile: "Maybe I am old too, I just heard that Lucien’s imposing performance is not like a young man. Excited, but feel too violent, a little unable to adapt. Of course, this can not deny the excellent melody and skill of the piano music edited by Lucien, but I also hope that this "history" written by him himself can bring us different Feelings."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The father said, Natasha wrinkled her nose without refutation, secretly thought: "The previous performance was too charming and too imposing. I want to learn Lucy’s fingering skills as soon as possible!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Felice and John saw that there was no cold spot on the road for three consecutive times. The selected music was also extremely warmly welcomed, so I quietly relaxed a bit. Then, as long as the last piano sonata was welcomed, the concert of the road will be completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ On the Plaza Mayor, the slender brunette is looking at the stage in the crystal wall, listening to the surroundings seems to be able to smash the roof. Turning the applause, whispering and whispering to himself: "It shouldn't be like this. It shouldn't be like this. His fingering and playing skills are wrong!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I can think of myself just immersed in the crazy and crazy piano melodies and wild romantic fingering performances, Piero is more and more unacceptable and hateful, as if only scolding himself can confirm that his father’s playing art is correct. Immortal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On the right, his previous piano music is skill-built, without the theme and connotation he advocated. It must not be accepted by himself. Your own fingering! It must be like this!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;恍恍惚惚Piyru did not pay attention to Lucien re-appearance, sitting in front of the piano again, eyes closed slightly Brewing feelings. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audience in the squares of Piola and Lilith were quiet and waiting for the last piece of music by Mr. Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can it replace the symphony to end the concert in climax and perfection?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ............Lu Xien sat quietly in front of the piano and knew that he had no problem in the playing skills of "Sorrow" with the strength of the quasi-knight, but the first movement of "Sorrow" can become three movements. The most difficult one is because it contains strong feelings and thoughts. Once there is no emotional integration, what is played is just a series of mechanically pale notes that make people judge whether they are good or bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene of sad repression is flowing through Lucine’s heart:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During meditation, I will worry that the night watchman will pass outside the house and discover the unusual fluctuations of mental power. When doing experiments in the magic laboratory, I will worry that the movement is too big to be noticed; when practicing magic, always pay attention not to leave too obvious traces; When you meet with the magic circle, you must cover up your true identity. If you are afraid of being bullied or have a church spy; when you are acting as a "professor", when you save the masses, you are dangerous and thrilling. Every step is like walking on a cliff. Being indifferent would be a sacrifice for blood sacrifices or a victim on the firearms. It was very tense, depressed and uneasy; until this time, Lucien discovered that there was a lot of negative depression in his heart, so they were led out. , brewing an outbreak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pedals are all stepped on, and Lucien’s arm slams the set of sounds from the heart! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When! The strings in the piano seem to be shaking! Let people be surprised! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a slow, dark melody that slowly plays out, bringing out a very strong and tragic taste! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the repression and sadness of Lucien from the heart, the desire to get rid of bondage and peace of mind! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just the beginning, the Grand Duke of Ouolette felt the deep tragic atmosphere, like the dark dark clouds before the summer rainstorm, like the heart The heavy stones inside are like unspeakable sadness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling is not only a big man, but other nobles or civilians, as long as they have a rich life experience, they all have a similar feeling, they all I was infected by Lucien's emotions resonating through music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha seems to have returned to the winter of that year, and Aalto’s sky is rarely seen with black pressure and lead clouds, which makes people feel depressed and seems to be able to It is expected that something bad will happen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher remembered the lady who had accompanied her for nearly 50 years but had left her first, remembering the destruction under the pressure of her loud reputation. Son, he would rather go out of business in a difficult and dangerous way, facing the fierce kobolds, gnolls, and not stepping into the piano room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was too much sadness in life, but I can only remember your smile, Winnie." Victor closed his eyes, quietly Listen to the slow tragic introduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When such a melody sounded at Feili's ear, she naturally thought of the pain that the Earl of Hein couldn't get sick that night after the oyster party. And sad emotions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John next to her holds her fist tightly, and firmly in grief wants to completely remove the evil in the dark! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piola, Sharon and others on the Municipal Square thought of the unsatisfactory music path and thought of the long torment of Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilith and Sarah are perhaps the best to understand the Lucien emotions contained in the melody, the ubiquitous danger, the irrepressible repression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are always many bumps in life, and everyone has their own grief! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A series of quick notes that end down the end of the introduction, the music into the Allegro, the excitement, the challenge of the dark melody is like a huge wave slamming the rock, giving Exciting feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melody has become light and bright from time to time, presenting the good expectations of life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recurrence of the theme of the tragic tragedy allows people to resolve the grief and pain in their hearts even if they hear such a powerful and powerful melody, but because of the theme Playing, so that they are accumulating in their hearts, there seems to be a feeling of discomfort in the silence that makes you struggle to break out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the light melody is very gloomy in such heavy depression. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repression is getting heavier and heavier, watching Lu Xi’an’s fast and rhythmic and difficult playing, Daoutti feels that he is about to suffocate. It is like hearing the pain of the eldest son's death in the northern fortress, just like seeing the despair of the lady who gave up her future for the love between the two to the end of her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
