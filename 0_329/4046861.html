			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only Ogg, the strong master who knows astrology or possesses the ability to predict in the field, he himself determines the "abbreviation of the abyss" Natravos life and death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This important thing, they are more convinced of their own judgment, especially the "companion" that cannot be truly trusted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is no exception, the crystal ball in his hand quickly loses its luster, becomes dark, and there are some stars in it, and the traces of strange and mysterious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because no one tried to interfere with and cover the life and death of Natravos, Lucien quickly got the result, the "Abyss Lord" The legendary magician of the title is indeed completely degraded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Netravos is really dead..." After ten seconds, Ogg spoke with his hoarse voice as if it had rust. As a result, the tone was slightly emotional and awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After him, other legendary powerhouses have successively reached similar conclusions, the atmosphere of the scene has become more and more solid, and the storm seems to arrive at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, "Time and the Dragon of Light" Danisos used his indifferent but time-honored voice: "I look back at the time and traces, too The death and murderer of Natravos could not be found. Perhaps a strong person deliberately destroyed the traces. It may also be that the destruction storm at the death of Natravos was too intense, covering up and erasing other scenes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a direct retrospective of time, but any one thing, more or less will leave a "residue" in the "times of the river", only the initial mastery The strongest of time mystery can be traced back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of residue, the longer it takes, the thinner it is. Even the "Temporary Time Dragon" Danisos can't trace the "time scene" that is too far away, unless the imprint of this thing in the "Times of the River" is too deep, of course, whether it is artificial or coincidental. There will always be things that can't be traced back in a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the words of Danisos, the eyes of the Lord, Sonic, Dubnaar, the epic knight "six-armed judge" Cervantes and " The Nether Devil, Sterling, the vampire king Seth, and the "King of the Nightmare" are not completely convinced, but instead cast their eyes on the "King of the Dark Side" Og, the brain of the elders and Lucien. After all, this matter is very likely to be done by Danisos and Dracula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien put away the crystal ball in his hand, his face solemnly nodded to the "King of the Nightmare" and the Prince of Blood, indicating that he used the "monthly time" The same is true of the "Morning Crystal Ball" with the "Mirror of Destiny", and the "King of the Dark Side" Ogg also determines the words of Danisos through other prophetic spells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The brain of the elderly" is stiff in the seat, and the whole body suddenly becomes empty, as if there is no soul. The two eyes on the octopus's head became turbid and dim, but they didn't look old at all, and every strong man staring at his eyes suddenly felt his own slow thinking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'The main brain' completely took over the body..." Lucien was inaccessible and at a distance, and the space gap was everywhere. It is deep in the dark mountains. The "main brain" can control the "brain of the elderly" in this way. It is really a matter worth studying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the "brain of the elders" became very hoarse: "I only see 'the heart of Natravos before dying is full of pain and Pleasure..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain and pleasure? The former is well understood, whether it is killing himself or being killed, in most cases it will be very painful, what is the pleasure? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the legendary powerhouses present are subconsciously raising this question, but they soon wake up, Nattravos is a self-abuse fan, himself The more painful, the more pleasant the emotions, just as normal humans tasted food and wine and met happy things. Satisfied with ** or various **. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it really Nattraworth himself's 'playing' too much? It’s not too bad to blow up the talisman... or not let him directly The pain of true degeneration has not made him happy?” Lucien’s thoughts are no different from everyone’s mind. For some people, without the pressure of death, many things will not be satisfied. "Netravos seems to have a very serious morbid situation, but unfortunately there is no early 'mental treatment'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lucien turned to various ideas, "The King of the Dark Face" Og, "Six-armed Judge" Cervantes and others have begun to exchange ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whether Netravos is really killed, we must seize the opportunity to use this as an excuse to delay the meeting!" Said, he seems to be very opposed to the integration plan of Danisos and Dracula. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Void Devil" Sterling solemnly said: "Yes, we must first investigate the cause of death of Natravos, otherwise we even agreed to Danisos And Dracula's request, there will be no good consequences, but will lose the initiative, maybe when the mysterious death like Nattraworth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He is equally opposed to integration, and will not let go if he finds an opportunity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if we agree to integration, as a legendary powerhouse, there is enough weight for Danisos and Dracula to pull together, why do they want us? The next killer?" "Six-armed judge" Cervantes did not understand the truth, he has a more neutral attitude towards integration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, in case their real goal is not integration? What is the reason for the fallen legendary powerhouse in recent years, we don’t know..." A wolf prince, Sony, has a deep-rooted hatred of the blood family. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Bernal sees everyone becoming silent, secretly self-satisfied, controlling the tone of thought communication: "This time the event happened very much. Suddenly, although some people leaked news in advance, there was not much time left for us, and many methods could not be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to him, The eyes of the demon master, the brain of the elders and other strong people were shocked. When did Dubner say such a deep discourse? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I walked all the way, and I didn't think it was too appropriate. Should everyone be the same?" Du Bernal sought to identify with other strong players. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call. Sure enough, the original Du Bernal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dubner’s words seem to have inspired Ogg, he sneered: “So, the death of Natravos gave us a delay. The opportunity of time, as long as the time is sufficient, may not necessarily destroy the plot of Danisos and Dracula."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, good-looking novel:.' The count is not present. If he is found, he will be opposed in the blood family. The situation will be very different. After all, he can summon 'Silver Moon' and he is not afraid of Dracula." Eye Lord and Cervantes also said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The brain of the elderly" also said: "The dragon family is not a piece of iron inside, and Myrles and Danissos are years of rivals, even if Flora has fallen, and the relationship has not improved. As long as he can grasp his ideas, he can also split the dragon family."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Daniscos And Dracula is an unusually arrogant guy. Even if it is temporarily united, I am afraid that I will not be convinced of the other side. In the case of our full arrangement, we can pretend to promise and then provoke their relationship through the position of the 'President'. Let the New Dark Council be essentially indistinguishable from the present."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Even if it can't be destroyed. We can get enough benefits and status in the New Dark Council." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This group of legendary powers, except for a few one or two, most of them can’t be said to be superb, but they are also enough to be considered as savvy. Things come suddenly, Denis and Dracula’s toughness Slow attitude and beyond their expectations, will be presenting a one-sided situation, now have the chance, we will soon have plenty of time, naturally no longer naked. As soon as you say a word, I have made a plan to grasp the damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Du Bernal listened to their discussion, nodded with satisfaction, and sure enough, I still have to rely on me to inspire everyone's wisdom. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking exchanges quickly, they didn’t take long to discuss, and before the talks between Danisos and Dracula, the “King of the Dark Side” Get up and say: "Time and the dragon of glory, Prince Dracula, Natravos suddenly died, the murderer is unknown, a huge conspiracy may be over the dark mountains, we must first put down the prejudice, not to consider for the time being For other questions, I will fully investigate the cause of death in Natravos and eliminate the danger. I think this is also a good opportunity for the two to show us that the New Dark Council is better than the present."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
