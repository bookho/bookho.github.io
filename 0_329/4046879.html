			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of the new year, the weather in the whole Holm kingdom is still gloomy and cold. It seems that there has been no clear skies for a long time, and in the "city of the sky" Aringe A layer of pale white mist gradually diffused, forming a sly world around it. In the darkness caused by the fog, the stars rose and the track was mysterious, and together they built a layer of magical array. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the magic steam trains heading to Aringe were ordered to stop in place, and all the magicians who returned from the outside world or prepared to leave the city of the sky were witnessed. After the fog, I also understand from my common sense that this is the opening of the Aringe lock, and it must not be hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a small number of magicians who were just caught in a lock were dizzy and found themselves moved to the streets of Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How did the Allenlock lock suddenly open?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the "cursed eye "Atlante, "Deformation Master" Elika and other members of the highest jury, or "Ominator of the annihilation" Oliver and "Death of the Soul" Vicente and other arcanists, who can first detect the "city of the sky" The strong of change, the heart is inevitably surprised. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they have just received the message from Hathaway, who guarded the "City of the Sky", with the Speaker of the Douglas, "The Emperor of Control" Brooke, because of For an important and urgent reason, the Aringe lock is temporarily opened, and it will return to normal after 40 minutes. At that time, they will be informed of the cause of the incident and will be reviewed by the highest panel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Oliver and other members of the top panel are not angry, because according to the rules of the Magic Council, if there is an emergency that is too late to notify other strong players, the guards The Arcane Master of Sky City only needs the consent of the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker to make a decision. Now, Douglas and Brooke obviously have no objections. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what they are wondering is what happened, and they will be eager to let Hathaway not have time to announce himself and others. This has never happened in the past. After all, the legendary magician has a half-plane and is connected to the Allinge Magic Tower. It is very fast and convenient to contact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worry, speculation and other emotions are fermenting in their hearts. Suddenly, they see a sun rising in the fog, shining through all directions! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sun, the misty and undulating or towering peaks of the green hills, the lush black forest, the mirror-like clear and peaceful clear lake A lawn like a carpet, it seems that the entire city of the sky has crossed another world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Linth Od?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real Secrets?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The world in the mirror?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The different words flashed in the heart of a strong person represent the same meaning. The Speaker of the Magic Parliament, the "Arcane Emperor" Douglas's half-face! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It actually stands out directly in the main material world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not impossible. In the case of magical arrays, Oliver and other arcans have no problem, but what is the point? Like the heterosexual space, it will be rejected by the main material world. Even if it is presented directly here, it will fall with the projection, and there is no difference between the forces. It is a waste of time and material. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They still have a clue in the future, and there have been amazing changes in the "real world"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue sky of the "sun" is darkened, and the "sun" is getting smaller and smaller, just brighter than the ordinary stars. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast expanse of the universe, stars, planets, asteroids, comets, etc. all operate in an orderly manner in accordance with the laws of the celestial bodies, and become a galaxy, Nebula, some of which, there is no trace of light, as if even the light is swallowed in, showing the ultimate darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Traditional System...This is part of the Speaker’s cognitive world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Locked off, Oliver can only see the part that is outside, and then make judgments. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the sudden incident, several legendary magicians who were not far apart had already contacted each other through the half-face to exchange views. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vision has never been seen before, so it’s extravagant, and I think of Lucien a few months ago? Evans discovered the sun, how could their legendary magicians have no guessing direction? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the real sky suddenly darkened, and the people of Rentat suddenly had a feeling of coming to the middle of the night from noon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The sky here is also dark..." Elika, the "Transformation Master" in the capital of the capital of the Principality of Calais, looked out of the window. The sky, the voice trembled slightly, and the tone was strongly unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What? Cox is darker?" Oliver repeated it unbelievably. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have personally experienced and witnessed the vision of semi-cure and solidification of the cognitive world many times, knowing that the vision caused by the promotion of the legendary peak has a little impact. The country, now this wide range of darkness is too exaggerated, right? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, they received feedback from the Magic Council branch:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buriana The sky of the kingdom is dark! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pearl Islands and the Solar Islands are dark in the sky near the sea! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky in the North Coastal Corridor and surrounding areas is also dark! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Holy Heilz Empire, the Shahran Empire, the Vaurit Principality, the Dark Mountains, the Moonlight Sea, the Endless Ocean, etc., whether during the day, Still in the dark, all of them are caught in the darkness of the fingers, as if the sun was blocked by what! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City of Lans, "The Holy Avenger" Melmos apparently stayed a bit, he initially thought that the saints were promoted to the legendary peak This can be quickly rejected, because with the strength of his legendary peaks and the mastery of the magical powers of the holy city of Lance, it is impossible to sense the "God of grace" that comes to the forefront, and on the contrary The thing he can monitor is calm and abnormal! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happened?" Melmos looked up at the sky and tried to find clues. At the same time, he started the holy city of Reims. The magical array prevents the enemy from attacking - regardless of whether or not Pope Benedict III has an order, he must do so. This is the duty of the head of the Templars stationed in Reims. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the darkness of the sky, there are no bright stars, bright and clear, but there is an unspeakable sly and mysterious . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They move slowly in the sky, bringing out the eternal taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is, this is the starry sky!" Although Melmos himself is a knight, he has been fighting magicians for many years, and they don’t know them. It is not profound, so I will recognize the origin of this starry sky. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his pupils contracted violently, and an illusory star in the sky shines brightly, suppressing all other stars of fate, and then, this The stars hang down a bright, bright, flickering light that hits the "far ground" like an incandescent laser. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermos turned around and instantly appeared outside of Benedict III’s home, with a strong sense of foreboding! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What? His Majesty the Pope is doing prayers and not letting anything bother?" The Cardinal, who faced the residence of Benedict III, Melmos The strong man with a good knight style is also a bit out of control. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Didn’t he perceive this amazing vision outside? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cardinal shook his head: "The Pope does not have any instructions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You go in and report, I believe you have seen the changes in the sky.” Melmos urged, while relying on the magical items to find the source of the vision. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The City of the Sky? Douglas is in the impact of the gods?" Melmos's right hand holding the sword seems to be very hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
