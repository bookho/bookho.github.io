			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is very relaxed this time: "Teacher, this is a micro-disciplinary paper. I have newly discovered an atomic interior composed of particles and two new elements. Departure, perfect your atomic structure model, and extend this model to the deeper meaning of the theory of alchemy reaction, ionization, atomic valence, etc. Since the research in this field involves the mystery of material changes, it may be possible to complete the alchemy generation. The dream of generations, so I named this theoretical system 'new alchemy'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Newly discovered atomic internal particles and two new elements?" Fernando's serious and dignified expression eased, and he opened the paper while asking questions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After subverting the indivisible point of the atom, the internal structure of the atom belongs to a completely new field. It seems that no matter what kind of result, the magician does not know the world collapse. The possibility - this is a theory without precedent, no magician used them to build a meditation environment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Fernando is basically assured that the ray of wind that has been confirmed by experiments has not subsided, if Lu Xien throws up another subversion. Theory, he doubts whether Aringe will be covered with a thick layer of strawberry jam and milk white cream. Although he has a fascinating scene for him with an "old metamorphosis" nickname, it may be more pleasing to the eye, but it will definitely be Scared of any pure boy who is interested in the magical path, so that even if the system is closer to reality, the promotion speed will be faster, and the strength of the Magic Council will shrink due to the small number of successors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I got the inspiration from the teacher's idea of ​​bombarding the metal foil with the atom, and also let them bombard the gas through the magic array, bombarding the hydrogen nucleus from the nitrogen, with There is a unit positive charge, which can be initially judged as a new elementary particle similar to electrons, and then confirmed again from the discovery of the anode ray. And the two new elements, I am standing in the teacher, you temporarily put down the analysis of the surnamed material On the basis of the experiment, traces of new elements were found."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien sees Fernando's face easing, probably guessing the thoughts in his heart, can't help Shaking his head quietly, this field will be subverted than any other field in the past, because it will subvert the macro-cognition of the magician and the philosophical worldview. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando has seen the "proton" part of the front, and is very serious and sighs: "If it is not your light quantum hypothesis, let me and Hathaway transfer the experiment." At the center of gravity, I have temporarily put down the experiment of analyzing the material of the surname, and perhaps we have discovered traces of new elements..." By the way, the praise for the students was obliterated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, he turned to the corresponding part of the paper, looked at the basic data such as the atomic weight of the two new elements, and the face became dignified again: "This can almost Explain that they are derived from the decay of the original elements, uncovering the corner of the restricted area of ​​the gods, and it is no wonder that you have to name the new alchemy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" In fact, combined with the discovery of the protons before, it is possible to construct a theoretical system that explains the changes in matter." Lucien's expression is unchanged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando’s head jerked up, and there were countless flashes of lightning in the red eyes, and the powerful pressure shrouded Lucien: “Do you understand what you are talking about? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Lucine said very cautiously, using "involving", "maybe" and other descriptions, Fernando did not care, the field itself is indeed involved Material changes, but now, he has actually promoted the construction of a theoretical system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can be called a system, it is not a simple one or two hypotheses! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Lucien answered calmly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando still asks solemnly: "Do you understand that this is really entering the restricted area of ​​the gods, and taking the authority of creation into human hands?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understand." Lucien answered briefly and forcefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando once again sternly asked: "Do you understand the meaning it represents?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Understand, it is enough to change the era, the title of the Great Arcane Master." Lucien looked directly at the teacher's eyes, "but I am only the construction of the purely theoretical surname, the specific experiment has to be upgraded after the magic and alchemy level to have the regular surname It is estimated that it will take a long time to verify."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Does the teacher also acknowledge that particle flow bombardment can be a routine experiment?” Lucien is quite looking forward to authenticity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando glanced at him with a funny smile: "Did you admit it long ago? Is your magic tower so slow to build a magical array? "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, do you know?" Lucien was a little surprised, and did not expect the teacher to visit his unfinished magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two half-ring metal hollow boxes engraved with magical arrays, silvery white, an indescribable feeling." Fernando would admit that he secretly cared about students. Describes the appearance of the underground part of the Lucien Magic Tower. "I can probably guess what you want to do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Electromagnetic cyclotron, let electronics, etc. Each time the particle is half a circle, it gets an acceleration, and it gets more energy, so it has better bombardment effect..." Lucien introduced the design concept roughly, "in theory, it can accelerate to any high energy. However, due to a number of factors, it can only be within a certain range, but it will also produce better bombardment effects than particles that have previously obtained higher energy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lucien is vague, it is impossible to say that it is limited by the relativistic effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any high energy, particle bombardment... I feel more and more that you want to destroy the world..." Fernando repeated the keyword and screamed "But this is a worthy idea. My half-level laboratory has to be arranged."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is also an experimental madman. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I become a legend, I have my own half-plane, and with enough energy, I have to arrange a large particle collision device." Lucien I don't mind showing my "ideal" and "fanaticism" in front of the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando laughed with a sigh of relief and continued to bury his head and read the paper. With the atomic internal structure model of protons, neutrons and electrons, with the confirmation of decay, With the theoretical explanation of material changes, he is no longer surprised by this. He has always seen that Lucien introduced the concept of quantization into the orbit of electrons, and then smashed the fangs: "Before the Brooke experiment confirmed the optical quantum hypothesis, face this Thoughts, I will slap you a meal, but now, light can be quantized, and electronic orbital quantization is not an unacceptable thing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien laughed and said nothing, this is the time to wait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But the electrons are actually space jumps, not through the middle position, or a little unbelievable, is the name special?" Fernando explained the orbital transition with his own understanding. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Ben thought that this discontinuous concept of transition will be snarled by Fernando, but for a moment he forgot the phenomenon of space jumping in the world, let the magician They are more acceptable in this description, so whispered: "The natural conclusion that emerged after quantization, I don't know why."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting from this model Several prophecies were made. Fernando looked at any further continuation. After reading the relationship between the outer electrons and the alchemy reaction, after the description of the nature of ionization and atomic valence, he put down the paper and said in a rather solemn tone. "Your 'new alchemy' system still contradicts the classical electromagnetic theory, and there may be some modifications, but the nuclear structure and material changes, the discussion of nuclear extranuclear and alchemical reaction, I initially recognized."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There has been alchemy since humans learned magic, but you are the first to really point out what alchemy is!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernan rarely praises people Lucien let a little old head reddish, but "alchemical development" Parliament also considered wonderful, almost to the phase change material, the structure and synthesis of organic matter is still in its infancy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After your theory is put forward, the alchemy faction is truly incorporated into the elemental system, if Hathaway can absorb your theory of digestion and perfect it. That may not be how many years, she will be able to promote the legendary peak." Fernando is quite sigh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien cares more about his teacher: "What about the teacher?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I? I am good at too many fields, the promotion speed has been slow, and the atomic structure, material changes and my legendary career relationship are not too deep, unless the material changes are linked with energy bursts and high temperatures, I can become a legendary peak." Fernando This time, I laughed at myself. He also knew that he was good at too many fields and was always distracted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
