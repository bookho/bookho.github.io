			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wooden house is located in the middle of the mountains, surrounded by strange trees, rock-filled forests, beasts and beasts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando calms his face and walks back and forth in the hut, thinking about waiting for the leader of the "Mooded Dance" organization How to organize the language, how to avoid yourself ridiculing the other side, if possible, it is best to meet the "curse of the eye" Atlante, although he is not the leader of this organization, but everyone knows that he is behind the scenes Manipulator. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Fernando’s heart was moving, and in the mental field, dozens of magicians flew over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation, scared him, and suddenly there was a translucent force field wall, and the spell that broke the space blockade was ready to go. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are they doing? So many people besieged me? Why is it so powerful that I have a chance to escape? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question echoed in Fernando’s heart until he saw several acquaintances—high-level magicians he had seen mixed in, eager to face rather than hate Only then put down my heart and worry, only doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fernando, I heard that you are very good at calculus?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can tell me What should I do with this?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think about gravity?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem was smashed out of the mouth of the magicians, weaving it into an even more exaggerated noise than the birds and beasts, making Fernando's ears creaking and irritating in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Enough!" Just like the thunder of the thunder, the noise is completely suppressed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando is not as gentle and kind as Elika, considerate others, and roaring is his great specialty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scene suddenly quieted down, Fernando replied: "How do you explain the calculus in this way? And how do I know your progress?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn’t care if this is someone else’s home, there are a lot of high-level magicians opposite, and even a great mage who is stronger than him, and he’s like a strict teacher. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, above the arcane, only the difference between understanding and not understanding, there is no aura of their own identity and strength! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After shaking the magicians. Fernando solemnly said: "I am here to discuss the questions of your "Mooded Dance", and when the matter is over, I will stay for a few days depending on the situation, and comb the calculus foundation from the beginning, as far as gravitation Something, wait until you have finished digesting the front."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a senior magician, he is qualified to prove that "the mathematical principle of magical philosophy" has How precious, how profound the description of the world is, how strong the shock of the magician is, and therefore a similar response is expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s just that. What he didn't expect was. Will reach this level! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that your expectations are not bold enough! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His words made the "magic dance" magicians look back. Everyone was surprised. It is one thing to ask for advice. But it is another matter to be so frank and ready to explain. The knowledge of calculus and gravity should not be their top secret. So don’t you teach us anything? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, a magician reminded Fernando: "The Cursed Eyes changed the 'Mooded Dance' into a 'Sorcerer's House'. It means the union of many organizations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The president is?" Fernando asked directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice just fell, and a magician flew in the distance. He sang: "Mr. Fernando, "The Eye of Curse" invites you to see him. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also good, so as not to convince the president, you have to go through the Atlante. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting place is not in the half-way of Atlant. It is a garden filled with flowers of various colors in the valley. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Frankly, I thought about taking you down and getting the complete knowledge of calculus and the details of gravity directly from your mouth." Atlan Very close eyes, smile makes people say like a spring breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando licked his mouth and didn’t see the legendary oysters: “They are really worthy of you. But this is what would have been shared with all magicians. Knowledge."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All magicians?" Atlante smiled and asked, it seems that everything is under control. Fernando snorted: "Yes, Douglas believes that understanding the world, grasping the law, and dialysis of the principle requires more people to join," More communication can lead to better development, so he defines this part of the knowledge as an arcane, that is, something that can be shared with other magicians, and the details of the magical knowledge about the spell model is personal. The secret is shared by personal will."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arcane?" Atlante did not smile for the first time, showing a thoughtful expression, "Sounds Douglas Want to build a purely arcane exchange organization? Is this his definition and classification?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is not so deep, such as how to motivate researchers, But this is indeed Douglas and our wish, and hopes to build a solid 'magic building' on top of this organization of arcane exchanges, collectively known as the 'All-Union Wizards' Parliament, to jointly resist the church." Fernando did not Hide their own purposes, nor skill to elicit the topic, but directly address road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante gently daggers: "I am very interested in the organization of pure arcane communication type, the latter 'magic building', you need to look again Look."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one of the most important books in the history of magic in Mathematical Principles of Magic Philosophy. Which magician does not communicate with pure arcane Interested in the organization? Of course, by then, they will definitely weigh the knowledge they have shared with the situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am not surprised by your answer, really." Fernando said with a bit of sarcasm, only willing to take advantage, not willing to take responsibility, this is the beginning of the magic empire One of the important reasons for the collapse, "My purpose is to bring your 'blurred dance', 呃, 'Sorcerer's House' into this communication organization. As for the future, I believe that you will choose the right direction." Will show the only way to hope for the light! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the arcane exchange has been a long time, this academic organization naturally has a cohesive force, naturally someone is willing to consciously maintain, and then integrate, it will be much easier, this is Douglas’s conspiracy, Fernando knew that Atlante was also clear, but could not resist this temptation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlante suddenly opened his eyes, his pupils deep like a star: "I am waiting."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "Douglas should have been promoted to the legend?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, 'magic voters'." Fernando tried to keep himself against Atlant Eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communication between the two was simple and rapid, and soon reached a consensus. When Fernando left the garden, his heart suddenly felt a bit stunned. The old fox was hardworking, so It’s easy to get to the legendary cooperation, but his persuasion is so light, in addition to the great influence brought by the "Mathematical Principles of Magical Philosophy", it is also the change of the situation, but also lies behind a legendary magician as a solid backing. The old fox did not. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year later, a large circle around the Stormwind Strait Fernando returned to the "Hull" manor provided by Hathaway and re-visited Douglas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is the attitude of 'Hell'?" Fernando did not greet him and went straight to the subject. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it was too laborious, Douglas’s hair was a little white, and his expression was solemn: "I stayed in the 'burning city' for half a year, then He was asked to go out of hell, not only did he not see 'Hell Lord' Maldives, but even several Dukes of Hell could not visit successfully."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
