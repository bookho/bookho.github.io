			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is blue, cloudless, and the bright sunshine is sprinkled on the re-closed Allinge, and it is golden in addition to the pale fog. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either Oliver, Bergner and other legendary magicians, or Heidi, Annick, Sprint and other ordinary arcans, have a mouth and a half The horror of how to close together, the solemn description of Lu Xien Evans's sentence, outlines a clear, rigorous, self-consistent arcane system, including the essence of magic, the essence of the soul, the real world. Feedback and other arcane systems that have plagued the magician for tens of thousands of years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although he only put forward concepts and assumptions, and used this to perform logical deductions, he concluded that there are no detailed and detailed studies, but conclusions and facts, The phenomenon and the conformity with the experiment all indicate its relative correctness, giving yourself and others a brainstorm, giving yourself and others a strong shock that has never been seen before. It seems that the essence of the world has been vaguely revealed. In front of you! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the eternal pursuit of the Arcans! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-universe, high-dimensional space-time, soul immortality, and other novelty to the inconspicuous concept of a dream slang once again refreshed their worldview, outlook on life and values: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original "Starry Sky" symbolizing the "real world" is another parallel universe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original death is just the dissipation of the soul's essence projection! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original deaths in some custom customs will be judged by the gods after death, and some souls can be re-emerged as intelligent creatures such as humans, dragons and elves, and some will Become a common creature such as cattle, horses and sheep, and some are forever confined to the depths of hell, or a little truth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is no current memory. Without the current character, without its own unique volatility and breath, is that still it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s not the three devastators..." Apart from the ordinary people and nobles who don’t understand, all the intelligent creatures that have a certain understanding of the whole world are subconsciously The term is repeated in the heart. The skyscrapers, steel torrents, and the intelligent creatures with human faces and features that are close to the front, let them subconsciously resist. But they have to face up to this theoretical model, at least this is more in line with their taste than the observer effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien relies on "closer" to the essence of the world and the mystery of the world, to explain his own arcane system, to ignite the "feedback" of the real world. "Beat" broke Wicken's "the boundary between God and man", and even made them stunned and couldn't believe their eyes! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to blast the magician's head by relying on arcane theory. There are also many precedents, but Viken has long been a magician. He has no cognition of the world. The heart of faith is in its absolute control. Actually, Living Evans relied on his mouth to explain the new arcane system and break the defense. They have to suspect that they are still in a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if we are not dreaming. That... I don’t know why, they looked at Wicken’s fear and despair and they became slightly pity at this time. This fact is too ruthless and cruel! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look at the boundary between light and darkness, the size of the gap collapses, and Wicken seems to stay in general, and there is no movement for a short time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stopped, no closer, right hand down, slightly emotionally said: "So, I always believe that there is 'God', each of us is Your own god!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't seek to explore the essence of your soul. Instead, you want to integrate the soul fluctuations of others and try to find the way to high-dimensional state by quantity. The road is completely in the opposite direction. Just like in the mathematical equations, we are trying to increase the expression and eliminate the unknowns, but you are increasing the number of equations with the unknowns, and the number is the same. How can this be solved? "An answer?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sometimes, quantitative changes do not necessarily produce qualitative changes, or the direction of qualitative change is not necessarily what you want."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he said this, Lucien thought of himself. If you are traversing for some reason, and you have the soul characteristics of the two universes, you can find some commonalities through comparison and exploration. I am afraid that I will not be promoted to the gods so quickly. The soul of the original Lu Xien has dissipated. However, there are still fragments left, such as giving the summer wind language ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Lucien thought it was the credit of his spiritual breakthrough in life and death, but now he knows that although there are reasons for this, it does not occupy the main factor. It is necessary to know that the age of magic is strong enough to exceed At that time, Lucien didn't know how many times the spiritual genius was not lacking. When they first tried meditation, it was never so easy, so fast, so simple! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, others can’t check out Lucien’s “soul library,” whatever they do, just as they can’t directly destroy the cognitive world. This is already an esoteric content related to the change of the universe. Even the current Lucien has no more detailed research, only a preliminary concept and a few formulas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the content protection of the "Soul Library" is obviously its own instinctual protection, otherwise the feedback of the "real world" will be very intense, and the connection with the original universe will Suddenly strengthen, this will make the "traversal" unable to withstand, maybe it will be "pull" back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for why it will cross, what is the reason for crossing, Lucien will not bother to think about it for the time being, because this is probably a coincidence, such as just this side The soul of Sean is lost, and the flesh of the summer wind is lost, so there is a strange synchronization in the case of the initial coupling of the two universes. There are many such guesses, all of which are extremely small and extremely small. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these are not to make Lucien a fuss, like every boy, going back, except for a few special cases, they will basically find their family every There is a man in the generation. Think about it. From the very beginning, how likely is it that there is at least one boy in each generation of children? So everyone is lucky! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When listening to Lucian’s words, Viken was angry and erupted, and the body’s souls screamed and screamed, dissipating most of the “negative emotions and After the power of faith, He seems to have been able to initially control his "body." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any case, I have combined the power of 'Heavenly Mountain' and 'Ancient Hell', even without the level of 'true God', there is the power of true God, I have to take a look, can you afford it!" Viken suddenly raised his right hand, and without the Platinum Scepter, an illusory angel prayed in his body:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great Lord, you are one and 10,000!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicken's breath quickly rises and becomes detached, and the white light converges on his palm, and then with his body as the core, the boundless light erupts, locking Lucifer En broke out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is able to instant "God Drop"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any sequelae, instant "God Drop"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, He is the source of power for the "God Drop"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred light of the milk makes the time seem to stop, and the legendary peaks in the distance have no reaction, only a round of silver moon, nine layers of hell and a world like reality It is difficult to stop more in the ocean of the Holy Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God Drop" hit Lucien, not far from Wicken, white and shiny, drowning everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dead?" Wicken was surprised and puzzled to think that there is no such thing as a "God" in the power of his true God. Got a hit! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "God Drop" light dissipated, as if the time of solidification was as good as ever, and in front of Viken, a figure wearing a black double-breasted long dress was slowed down. Slowly floating, still handsome and gentle, still elegant smile, holding a silver-white exquisite pocket watch in his hand, open the cover and look at the time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How come? After being hit by the "God Drop" with the power of true God, how can it be intact? Nothing at all? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only Wicken, Douglas, Mardi Moss, the legendary powerhouse around, and the magicians and knights on the ground all have the same idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s figure quickly solidified, his smile calmed down: “The essence of 'God' is the 'contact' that touches the high-dimensional soul and soul projection. Then destroy it and destroy all traces along it, so you can directly lock the soul, no matter how you avoid it, you can avoid it, so you can attack it from a long distance, so you can make the strong people outside the gods unable to resurrect."
