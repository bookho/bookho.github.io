			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night, when Lucien separated the three rays one by one through the electromagnetic field magic array and other magic arrays, and determined some of the surnames, half-fantasy In the cognitive world, the two new elemental light points emerge with the vibration, and are added to the trajectory of other elements according to the cycle name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the elements has no color, the exception is "lazy" and has almost no features, while the other silver-white element light spot emits three channels. The strange rays, echoing with the electrons surrounding the elements, are colorless and tasteless, and the reading power of the world is a singular and indistinguishable color. The inside contains a handful of magical runes, which form a A heart-rending, incomplete and strange model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these incomplete runes and incomplete three-dimensional patterns, Lucien noticed the power of a "curse", silent, killing invisible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not good at cursing. I need to use the knowledge of curses and runes to fill the spell structure and become a real magic. It takes at least half a year to study." Lucien is already a veteran who has created several unique magics. He has a lot of experience in this area and quickly made judgments. This is the first mapping of the cognitive world and the real world as a guide. If you want to improve one from the curse of the past, it will take at least five years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But the curse of this level of magic is quite high, higher than the current imperfect element, it is estimated to be six rings, if there is a radiation surname in the hand as a casting material The quasi-high-level magician who is initially substantive in the cognitive world can probably barely use it, but after two or three times, the mental power is exhausted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elemental order in electronics Before the discovery is the three-ring magic, the power will become stronger with the level increase, and after the discovery of the electronic in Lucien, the perfect "elemental order" is already the standard of the five rings, and the "order of elements" in the same level than the third ring "The separation power has increased by 20%. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the structure of this "curse" is more complicated than the "order of elements", Lucien judges six rings, but most of its structural difficulties are radiating The mapping structure of the surname elements, if there is a combination of casting materials and spells, the complexity of the structure will be reduced to between the five rings and the six rings. For the Arcanist, who has almost mathematical knowledge and magical parsing ability. I can barely cast a spell, but it takes a lot of time and effort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this 'curse' called? 'Invisible Death'? 'Mystery Curse'? 'Evans' condemnation'? 'Luce's gaze' ? 'Professor's care'?" Half a year to a year, there will be a strange curse magic, Lu Xien is in a very good mood, thinking about several magic names, and discretion, decided to wait until the real creation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "curse" is not in a hurry, and Lucien begins to combine the "氦" that he just collected, and chanting the mantra, trying to separate the suffocating air from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the benefit of the magic world, there are a lot of strange and very good magic, such as having some kind of element and knowing most of its surnames, you can It is used as a casting material to "adsorb" a gas containing it from the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This magic is called "Haiweiwei's same-origination", five rings, high-level magic lab necessary, ordinary magic laboratory can not bear the magic array It's expensive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the hard mantra, Lucien didn’t feel the gas gathering, suddenly frowned, guessing that there was too little radon in the atmosphere. , so the magic effect is not good, it is difficult to adsorb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, Lucien’s Atomic Research Institute is configured according to the High Magic Lab, so he quickly turned on the corresponding magic array and finally felt a little gas gathering from the room. Elsewhere, the air from the open window floated, and it was hard to collect the helium of several test tubes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is too little air, so you have to find the elemental mineral or natural gas, oh, maybe in the stars, in the universe, you can collect enough materials. But the radiation 'curse' there is too horrible, not that I can now set foot, and I can only ask the teacher for help later." Lucien began to consider the problem of casting materials in the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cursed Eye Atlante is also studying the curse of the vase. Although he does not experiment explicitly with the purpose of Lucien, he is not good at "Arcane." "Research, but it seems that it is only a matter of time before a certain ray is a "skull" nucleus and getting that curse magic. So, Lucien is going to put the paper in the teacher as soon as possible, and then throw it out at the right time to fight for new The magic created can be unique for many years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After calming down, Lucien began to try to liquefy hernia through a cascade of magical arrays and pressure magic arrays. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sky is about to be clear, in a high-order magical array, dripping colorless liquid appears in front of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, in the cognitive world of Lucien’s half-illusion, the colorless element’s light spots are partially turned into drizzle, surrounded by layers of ice and snow. The mysterious and mysterious crystal runes are highlighted, chilling, complicated but incomplete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember the interactions brought by the first mapping, Lucien passed the mature structure of parliament-like magic, and teacher Fernando, classmate Axikana In the exchange of ultra-low temperature ice and snow magic, there is a preliminary judgment: "This magic can be completely constructed within three days, but its degree of danger and complexity is high, and it requires better high-order pressure than 'pressure cage'. Magical integration. If you want to maximize your power, you don't need the full version of the spellcasting materials and spells. It should be nine rings. You can get close to absolute zero degrees Celsius at that time!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "If the power requirements are not so high, the corresponding pressure magic level should not be too high. The absolute low temperature is estimated to be seven-ring magic within three to four degrees Celsius."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is really a horrible snow magic! Lucian was a little scared by his own judgment, but I think that most of the ultra-low temperature magic of the high-level ice and snow magician of Axikana could not enter the absolute range of fifteen degrees Celsius, and Lucien was relieved. Even suspected that only in terms of temperature, the legendary magic may be the full version. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Lucien didn’t know the legendary magic of ice and snow, maybe they are very close to absolute zero, even after the decimal point, but there is no systematic theory. Guidance, so like most of the legendary magic in ancient times, knowing that there is such a cool, I don't know why it is so cold, it is difficult to reduce the learning requirements, it is difficult to use. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And the most horrible thing is that most of the difficulty of this ice and snow magic is in the construction, liquefaction and even curing of the corresponding model of the hernia, which can be advanced Prepare the cast material to solve the problem. The remaining spell models and spells are at most close to the level of the six rings. The only question is, how can you not freeze yourself?” Lucien slowly collected liquid helium into an expensive test tube. Inside, it has a layer of precise vacuum partition inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light is this test tube, it is worth a five-level magic item, the Lucien Atomic Research Institute discovered the electronic after only five approvals, it seems to be used in advance This ice and snow magic, you have to use wealth to smash! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't use the range of magical construction, you can only use the ray type, but also start a layer of vacuum defense at the same time, so as not to be spread a little cold after the cold Death." Lu Xien probably has ideas. If you want to use higher-level magic more and more, there are definitely many restrictions, dangers, and mental energy will be completely exhausted after two or three times. "What is this snow magic called? Deep blue freeze ?Wings of the goddess of ice and ice? The solidification of all things? The extremely cold rays of Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking for a few minutes, Lucien decided to call it "the extremely cold of Evans." Ray", a seven-ring magic, and the full version of the nine rings is called "the whip of the goddess of ice and snow." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After the laser and the magnetic trap are cooled out, you can construct a legendary magic 'forgiveness of the goddess of ice and snow', oh, 'Professor's forgiveness' "Lu Xien laughed and teased himself. "When you have the ability to enter the sky or starry sky and find positrons, can you tell the legendary magic of 'material annihilation' or 'yang electronic cannon'?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............A night of exhaustion, Lucian’s spirit is very exciting, just a little faint, because he carries a “high-end magic test tube” with liquid helium. Seeking the sensation of death, if you accidentally break it, then there is no more... "Are you finished the experiment?" A tender and affectionate voice suddenly sounded in Lucien's ear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien was shocked, looking back, but it was ridiculous, Afris, this crystal dragon was hung with a white chef apron, hand With a plate of bloody steak, I was looking at myself with a good look. It was very funny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aphras, what is this?" Lucian asked with a funny smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Prepare breakfast for you, I am very good at cooking!" Averys said with confidence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at its crystal-clear scales, it’s estimated that there’s only one cooked steak on the plate, and Lucien licked his forehead: “Where did you learn?” Cooking? Wait, why come to prepare breakfast for me?" Wouldn't it be New Oriental? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
