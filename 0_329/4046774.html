			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the boundless darkness, one after another stars flashing the bright light of their trajectories, but their trajectories completely contradict the rules of arcane, seemingly inexplicable power Under the influence, it is moving in an extremely chaotic state. Therefore, it is often seen that the stars that have been in their own orbits suddenly break away from normal, and they slammed into another star with an unrelenting attitude, causing a horrible explosion. Kill any energy storms that exist below the legend. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, "Chaotic Starry Sky" is cold and silent, basically no devil can survive, which is why it can breed "time and space slate", but there is no way to create a demon The reason for the king is - unless it is a natural existence of "the abyss will", the other demons start from the bottom, relying on constant killing and engulfing the promotion, in the "chaotic starry sky" where there is basically no small demon to survive, naturally No one can grow up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he entered the "chaotic starry sky", there was another dark universe behind Lucien, the same vastness, the same vastness, the only different place. It is that the stars in this universe are colorful and indicate different elements. This is the legendary plane of the road to "Atomic Universe"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Atomic Universe" just emerged and expanded as if it had completely overlapped with the abyss of this layer. Then, each "Elemental Planet" began to exist in the original Earthquakes are like every microscopic particle has its own vibration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗡嗡嗡, in the illusory voice, the entire "atomic universe" violently oscillates, bringing up a burst of "chaotic starry sky", which is two planes The normal phenomenon of overlapping and blending. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The watery illusory ripples are centered on Lucien and spread in all directions. The speed seems to be the whole "chaotic starry sky" everywhere. Similar changes are taking place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha did not bother Lucian, and looked at the chaotic starry sky with great interest, judging by his shallow astrological knowledge: "All are asteroids." The light belongs to the extra, not the real star. Like your atomic universe..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the guidance of Lucien, she basically mastered the common sense of astrology. Moreover, the habit of using words is closer to the earth, and often the practice in the "atomic universe" is basically no mistake in the judgment of "chaotic starry sky". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of abyss is equivalent to a half-plane, of course, there is no way to have a more normal starry sky like ordinary alien space - the starry sky of different space, The sun and the like are basically different from the main material world. They seem to be only a small part of the vast universe. They cannot be presented as a whole, but they also have in common that they all follow the laws of the celestial bodies and there is no way to find the existence of the planet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the "chaotic starry sky" swaying more and more intensely · It also began a violent shock, in this change, Lucien passed feedback · Sensitively captures the information that you want to get, the eyes open, the faint light in the black pupil, and the starry sky, looking at the left starry sky: "'Time and space slate, over there, the coordinate position is..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the overall shock, the core part and the other parts will naturally be slightly different. Lucien is relying on this to quickly judge the position of the "space-time slate", otherwise he will not Try to make the "atomic universe" and the "chaotic starry sky" overlap. After all, it may be self-defeating if it is slightly inadvertent, and it is really contaminated by the abyss. Although this will not affect the stability of the half-plane, it is quite clear. trouble. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The position of the space-time slate was positioned in less than five seconds..." Natasha Silver-purple Shuangyu said with a little envy, in Lucy In front of her, she will not hide her normal emotions. "In addition to the abyss will and the demon prince, only the legendary magician can use the half-plane overlap to create a shock to locate the core so quickly..."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other legendary powerhouses without a half-plane can only use other means, relatively slower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Atomic Universe" behind Lucien disappeared, lest it be contaminated by the abyss, then grab Natasha's arm with his left hand and use the half-plane for the transfer. Station direct space jump. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chaotic Starry Sky" is just one layer of the abyss, and Lucien and Natasha jumped into a wonderful space in just a few seconds. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This space seems to be no different from the place of "Chaotic Starry Sky". If you look closely, you will find that the depth of black is different, as if there is a hidden space bending. It is like a dangerous ocean covered by a hidden whirlpool. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the "natural defense" caused by the leakage of the "space-time slate" power. It changes the time and space around it, so that Lucien and Natasha can't send it to it and easily take it away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this chaotic and dangerous space also allowed Lucien to confirm his position, "Time and Space Slate" is inside! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be careful." Lucien read the mantra and condensed the "time and space scepter", and each of them and Natasha each added a layer of time and space. Unchanging defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Natasha’s “Shield of Truth” held by his left hand is also raised, although in the absence of stillness, the defense of the “Shield of Truth” There are a lot of things that can't be considered, but it's enough to go through this dangerous space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two cautiously stepped into the "whirlpool" space, guided by the "mirror of fate" shining in front of Lucien, and quickly proceeded . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This space seems to be boundless, but it is actually an illusion caused by spatial confusion. After all, "time and space slate" is just a legendary material, and the power of leakage can affect The scope is just a second-class level of normal legend - of course, no legend will be boring to cover the entire range, magic, and attack, even if it is range magic, it can concentrate and concentrate as much as possible. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, less than ten seconds later, Lucien and Natasha saw a strange asteroid, which seemed to consist of diamonds, transparent Pure, exudes the beautiful radiance that most creatures cannot resist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shines from a black slate at its core, with a layer of water-like ray that sways, creating a clear, flowing scent, looming In the meantime, Lucien can see that its surface has many complicated mysterious patterns similar to the monthly timepieces, full of the feeling that time is difficult to trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the purpose of Lucien, the legendary material "Time and Space Slate"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when discovering "space-time slate", Lucien and Natasha also discovered a 30-something man standing next to the asteroid He is tall and has a short yellow hair. His appearance is ordinary man of the Shahran Empire. He is rough and bold but gives the impression of peace and tranquility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his slightly cocked chin made him a harder and deeper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clement?" Lucien and Natasha said in the mind connection. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Saint" of the Northern Church, Clement, his looks, his breath, all recorded in the Magic Council and the Kingdom of Holman Secret information file! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why did he come here to take the ‘spatial slate,?” doubts rose in the hearts of the two. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Lucien and Natasha discovered Clemente, as a third-order priest of the Holy Spirit, Clement naturally sensed them, in my heart. More surprised and flustered than they are. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After knowing that "Time and Space Slate" has not been taken away by Lucien, Clement feels that he is in front of them and things will become very simple - He believes that even if Lucien and himself set off at the same time, the demon prince can help himself to take away the "spatial slate" in advance. Even let him not know who took it. After all, he still has to "boil the ocean". Fight fiercely with the legendary third-order "Lord of Fire". Even if he wants to circumvent it, it will take a lot of time to bypass it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Lucien is likely to be still preparing, and has not yet set off in Aringe! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows, after spending a short time looking for the "space-time slate" position and passing the "space vortex", he actually meets with Lucien's narrow road! This made him feel a little confused when he didn't make up his mind with Lucien! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the "space-time slate" at your fingertips, Lucy and Natasha, who entered the attack range, Clement A little hesitant, it is first installed "spatial slate", etc. If you have a chance to escape, or give yourself a few layers of defense? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hesitation is very short, and soon he has a decision. He can step by step to the present position. He has no doubt that he must not hesitate at this time. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
