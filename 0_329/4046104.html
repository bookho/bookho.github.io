			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night is deep, the beautiful silver moon sprinkles the cold glory, coupled with the breeze of the evening breeze, washes away the heat and prosperity of the hall, let the spirit of Lucien Oh, I feel that my body is full of strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the night view of the picturesque balcony, but more than a single person, a pair of beautiful women are hugging and kissing near the corner The bright and radiant moonlight shines on them, and with their intoxicating beauty, they paint a holy and beautiful oil painting that people can't bear to disturb and be alarmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled slyly and slowly retreated after holding the glass. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but Natasha is a five-level grand knight. Lucien’s coming in and how she got through her, she stopped intimate, and she turned red and gasped. The sulky Silvia is behind her, and the beautiful purple eyebrows pick it up: "Lu Xien, what is your expression? Any thoughts?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There is one." Lucien said half-jokingly, "Please don't ruin my eyes."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha snorted and pointed Refers to yourself, than Silvia, whispered: "Don't we be beautiful?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, that's another way." Lucy En and Natasha get along with each other more easily and familiarly, so humorously said: "Please don't hurt my heart."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha for this The way to get along and the dialogue seems to be very satisfying, the smile is relaxed and lazy: "Under your calm surface is actually a funny person, very suitable for being friends. Right, I have one thing to find you. Aside and said, while holding her head down deeply into the hall of Silvia, Lucien then followed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Natasha appeased a few Silvia, let her whisper and walked to the circle of musicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you dance a dance, Lucien? Let’s talk while we are jumping." Natasha’s tall, full-bodied body is full of charm. Extend your right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien didn't move, looked at it for a few seconds: "His Royal Highness, don't you think there is a problem with your posture?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes? Oh, I am used to it, forgetting that you are a man." Natasha suddenly realized that she had retracted her right hand and stood gracefully in the same place, waiting for Lucian’s invitation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dance music has become a melody commonly used in lap dances. Lucien extended his right hand to Natasha with a ritual not long after the beginner: "His Royal Highness Princess, Can you please dance a dance?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Of course, you are the best music consultant.” Natasha puts her hand on Lucien The palm of the hand, then walked to the center of the hall together and began to dance in a circle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The handsome man and the dance of the two knights should be very harmonious and full of beauty, but neither Natasha nor Lucien see it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, you stepped on my foot again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His Royal Highness It’s that you jumped the wrong dance step, this is the man’s...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is it? I don’t quite adapt to dancing like this.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You stepped on me, Your Royal Highness, your strength is really big..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, Lucy Well, it’s better to skip the ladies’ dance steps. This will solve all the problems.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“...Your Princess, you still continue to step on me.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two talents coordinated, Lucien asked about the business: "His Royal Highness, what are you looking for?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"嘿嘿." Natasha smiled twice, and it seemed a little bit embarrassing. "Sylvia listened to your piano sketch today and saw your performance. I was very fond of the piano. So she asked me to play one on the day she was born a new year ago. . & Nbsp;; & nbsp; & nbsp expression of love to her piano pieces "<br <br /> & nbsp />;Natasha laughed again: "But, I am full of passionate melody, I can't find inspiration for writing piano pieces. Lucien is also a musician. You should understand how to create when you don't have inspiration. How dry? Uninteresting works, I don't want to perfuse Silvia."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you want me to help you with your Princess? This is not a more perfunctory Sylvia, but also There are nearly two months, you don't have to worry, you should be able to find inspiration, as long as you seriously think about the sweetness and sorrow in your love." Lucien answered with some unbelievable, and then used to be sarcastic and ruthless. "I always think that your Royal Highness is a knight who is upright, brave and has good morals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha laughed twice and concealed her guilty conscience "Of course, I can be upright, brave, and moral. But Lucien, you didn't hear it? Silvia only asked me to play a piano piece, I didn't ask for it. But new Beautiful, with a taste of love The piano pieces are the best choice."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, "Dedicated to Silvia"?" Lucien thought of a familiar piece of music. Asked in a pun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha quickly nodded: "Well, dedicated to Silvia. Lucien, I will work hard to create it myself, and I invite you both." I also try to compose a piano piece that meets the requirements. If I really don't have inspiration, I will borrow you. When I finish playing, I will confess to Silvia, hey, maybe confess the next day?" Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If we don't have any inspiration, look for a musician from the past. Your Royal Highness, you know that I have no love experience." Lucien said here. Suddenly I thought of another thing. "So, in order to make the creation smooth, I want to borrow the love story of the knight and noble lady in your study. They can help me imagine love. Also, I want other books. Look, for example, to introduce the history, culture and traditions of other countries in the mainland. Maybe I can get inspiration from it. The exotic style always gives people a refreshing feeling. In the music library, Mr. Victor’s study, there are too few similar books. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;& Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Natasha’s study has been a long time, it is part of the Lata Summer Palace Library, which should have detailed mainland information, which is very important for future planning and journey. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiled happily, beautiful and dazzling: "This is a very easy thing, as you wish, but there are many ancient hills inside." The ordinary books handed down by the Van Nuss Magic Empire, the words they write are very different from the current ones. Do you need me to find a scholar to translate it for you? Or don’t you read it?”<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe the history at that time is very different from the present, and it is more inspiring? So, please ask the Princess, please find someone to translate it." Lucian almost could not control himself. Emotion, this is a good thing that I didn’t think of at all! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you look for opportunities to include those books in the Soul Library, and compare the translated versions, although slow, you can also start self-study in ancient Siravans. Text! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s level of knowledge at this time has been compensated to the general level of the university through the Soul Library, but the remaining books are sealed and cannot be viewed, so they can only review And consolidation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the study of magic, Lucien is also the same, apprentice-level magic, magic trap layout, magic array, preliminary alchemy, various astrological knowledge, etc. Completely interpreted and mastered by Lucien, if it is not because of mental strength that has not broken through to high-level magic apprentices, Lucien can begin to try to attack the ranks of the official magician. This is the opposite of other magic apprentices, who are unable to keep up with the rhythm of increased mental power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before attacking the official magician, interpret the content behind "The Book of Astrology and Elements", analyze a few more magics, master more The magical knowledge is all helpful to break through. The only problem before is that Lucien did not know the ancient language of Irvines, and he could not participate in the magic circle gathering and exchanged with others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in such a good thing, how can Lucien be excited, but when he thinks that Natasha is a five-level knight, now she is dancing like this. It was very difficult for her to change her emotions and her heartbeat to speed up her. Lu Xien forced her to suppress it. As a result, she took a wrong step and stepped on Natasha’s foot again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, you really should dance the lady's dance." Natasha complained a little about Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
