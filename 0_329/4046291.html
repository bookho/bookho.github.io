			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aalto Musicians Association, within the Victor's office. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the excitement of the students who have been returning for a long time, Victor and Lucien talked about the customs and folk music of the mainland, and the atmosphere was harmonious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, very good! Lucien, you have a lot of money in this trip." After the exchange, Victor did not hesitate to praise and rejoice. Because it is obvious that Lucien has a good insight and absorption of folk music. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Victor himself has also toured concerts in mainland countries, Lucien described his itinerary as arriving from the south-north of the mainland to the Stormwind Strait, and then Since there was a certain idea about the folk music in this area, I returned to the original road and settled for a long time. Lucien did not lie that he had returned from the southern part of the mainland or the northern part of the sacred Helz Empire, the Syracuse Kingdom, and so on, so it was easy for Victor to see the flaws. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not have any restraint in front of his teacher, nodded and smiled: "In fact, folk music in many places is very good, and has its own unique style. It is worthwhile for us to absorb into the music creation."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is part of the accumulation of music we are talking about, not often going out, looking, listening, Always staying in Aalto, it is easy to think rigidly and repeat the music. Of course, the precipitation and bursting of emotions is the most important part of music accumulation." Victor explained his own ideas, and he did not hide anything about Lucien. Selflessly teaching, "And Lucien's problems on the basis of your music are all made up, which shows your hard work and persistence for the past three years."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years Before, even if Lucien had a good memory, the body coordination was stronger, and it was difficult to master the music foundation in less than a year. It could only behave like a talented musician. In the usual exchanges, Lucien has no problem in talking to ordinary musicians and musicians. When encountering musicians like Christopher and Victor, it is inevitable that there will be omissions. Fortunately, they are all generous elders, and they know that Lucien really did not learn music for a long time, did not blame, pointed out and corrected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the road, in the life of Allinge, in addition to the study and study of arcane and magic, Lucien spent half a day in the week. Guide the apprentices, the rest of the time is to use music to enjoy and relax. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not uncommon in a magician. Although concentration is the primary condition for success, sometimes the study and study of magic needs to endure boring, sometimes very It is easy to immerse yourself in the "real world". If there is no other hobby to reconcile, it is possible to have a mental breakdown and an ordinary person. Therefore, most of the arcans have different ways of relaxation, such as "annihilation." The hand is an outstanding oil painter, a distinguished playboy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the road is to answer, the door is politely knocked at the door, light and rhythmic, not rushing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student, Lucien stood up and walked to the door and opened the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"President Christopher?" Lucien was surprised to see that the door to the door was actually a "live music legend." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of old, and the wrinkles began to deepen. Christopher still shaved his beard like he did when he was young. He smiled slyly. Sean, welcome back."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. President, how come you?" Lucien still uses a familiar name, even if he is the real president now. It is already Othello. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christoph laughed and said: "I am waiting for you, the young man, to visit me, this old man, and I haven’t seen you for a long time, so I have to. I found it myself. I am very curious about your experience and new music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher seems to be alive and humorous compared to three years There is a feeling of being younger and younger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I plan to talk to your teacher and go to see you..." Lucien was a bit sloppy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher reveals a witty smile: "Just kidding, I actually came to invite you to listen to a small concert with a young man. He came from the southern part of the Gusta Empire. He was a good guy who had suffered but did not give up music. After a lot of things, he finally went to Aalto. I happened to hear his performance on the street during the festival, and I felt a little bit interesting. So he was invited to a small concert in the Auditorium of the Association, so that we can fully appreciate his work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a talent in the street performance that can be appreciated by Mr. Christopher, the young musician will certainly not be covered up by many street performers and bards. His reputation should have been passed into his ears. But why have you never heard of it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher seriously nodded: "He has no money, he can't rent a venue to play a symphony, he can only sing songs with piano accompaniment. His songs are at the festival. It is very popular, but most of the gentlemen of the association have a subconscious rejection of non-operal, non-shengshi songs, which are considered vulgar, simple, and not worthy of attention. Right, he is called Franz." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe Mr. President, your judgment, is the small concert going to start?" Victor asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher pointed to the top: "Yes, let's go, ladies and gentlemen are waiting for us."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien and Victor were accompanied by Christopher on both sides, walking and walking, he suddenly smiled and said: "Lu Xien, I heard Franz said that he is very Worship you, your music gives him strength, otherwise he can't stick to the path of music."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Lucien gave a bit of incomprehensibility . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Franz's father is an ordinary citizen, doing the underlying things in a business. Originally his family had no money to let him touch the music, but he When he was young, he was selected to be a church choir, where he learned the basics of vocal music and simple theory of composition. Later he did not want to be a singer and left the choir. At that time, he was deeply in love. Music, began to frantically absorb all musical knowledge from libraries, musician associations and other places, and draw wealth from local folk songs and verses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cristo The husband briefly introduced Franz. "It was a pity that his creation was not loved by the nobility and the masses, and his father's death, he became poor and had to do other work to maintain his life. He worked as a wharf. Workers, who have been in charge of warehouses, have been bartenders and bards, but have continued to study and create music and poetry. As a result, they are less than twenty-two years old, and their physical and mental conditions have become very poor."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" When he couldn't support and wanted to give up music, the Symphony of Destiny spread to the southern port of the Gusta Empire, which allowed him to regain his strength and stick to it. Gradually, his songs became famous and their income became rich. However, he resolutely gave up all of this and embarked on a journey to Aalto’s dream of pursuing music.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor smiled: “It’s a tough Young people. Every time I hear this story of persistence and no giving up, my mood will become very warm."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Encourage him, give He is strong, I am very happy." Lucien is sincere, this can offset a little bit of his own embarrassment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............When accompanied by Christopher’s housekeeper, the three quickly walked to the auditorium on the fifth floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, many musicians, musicians and music students who got the news came curiously, ready to hear why this unknown stranger could Let Mr. Christopher invite him to the association for a small concert. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are full of positions in the concert hall, but the first row is empty, because according to the default rules, they are reserved for the most famous and authoritative top Musicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. President."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Victor."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Evans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Christopher, Victor, and Lucien sneaked in, they all got up Say hello, then watched them sit in the first row. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this, no one has raised doubts and they take it for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and others arrived not long after the small concert began, Franz wearing a black night dress, looked a little excited to go on stage, frequently bowed to the audience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about twenty-five and five years old, his face is thin, his appearance is not outstanding, his black hair is curled into a group of "small balls", which is a bit messy. But the expression is unusually solemn and solemn, just like worshipping in a church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
