This is the second member of the Atomic Research Institute to receive the Holm Crown Award after the Evans Committee."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the Atomic Research Institute, Jerome Mr. is definitely not the type that is eye-catching. It is not as bright as the Evans committee, nor is Mr. Lazar, Mr. Rock, and other active talkers, open-minded, and no Annick, Lei Yiya, Spring. The classmates of the special Evans committee are solid and determined to make progress. Then, what did he achieve today's achievements? The honest and honest gentleman in this eyes is what becomes a fourth-level arcane master, the three-ring magician, What about the owner of the thirty-two Holm ring?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On this issue, we interviewed Mr. Jerome today... Hello, Jero Mr. Mr., we just believe that you have already heard the question. Can you ask yourself? What do you think of this?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black with a unique light blue hair and deep blue eyes of the Soral Islands, listening curiously and curiously, except for X-rays, these years The news of the Atomic Research Institute seems to have nothing to do with Jerome. He seems to be the attachment of the results forever. His own experimental papers are not of great value, and they can't attract people's attention. But they can't think of it, they get the brilliance and get the elements. The highest honor in the field, which has enchanted the envy of thousands of arcane masters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the serious female voice stopped, the mellow baritone replied: "In fact, in the eyes of many people, I am not a qualified archer. Not to mention that Evans is so talented, even Roque can't reach that level. Similarly, many arcane masters think that I am only being favored by the lucky goddess. My discovery is only accidental. It is an accidental sealed fluorescent film. The more unexpected gains from the fall."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young magician Black nodded lightly, although he couldn’t talk about it, but he did think so, As can be seen from the papers in the journal "Arcane" last year, Jerome found that X-rays are more of luck, accidents, rather than theoretical and direction preparation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you think of Mr. Najrome?" The "Lark" of the "Aline Weekly News Review" faded seriously and asked with a slight smile. Road. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerrome smiled and said: "They are right, I admit it, but what I need to add is that I have done it continuously before I discovered X-rays. 1,272 days of experiments on cathode ray, when Lazar, Rock, and Sprint felt that they would not have any more gains, I continued, still using free time to complete "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At that time, I didn't think that there would be big discoveries. I just thought that there are still a lot of things about electronics and cathode ray, and there are still many. The data can't be read, so I stick to it. My qualifications are just enough, and I can only rely on diligence, persistence, seriousness and patience.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Perhaps an arcuist like me can't come up with a very imaginative theory of creating a surname, but I believe that we can lay a solid foundation for the arcane building and perfect the details for it. We are in arcane and magic. The field also has a future and a future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These words are plain and ordinary, and they are not vocal, but they say that Black is full of blood, muttering to himself: "diligence, persistence, seriousness, patience..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "Diligence, Perseverance, Seriousness, Patience..." The Lark chewed back and relished these words and smiled crisply. "Thank you Mr. Jerome for sharing his success. This has restored my confidence again. What else do you have?" I want to say?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, first of all, thanks to Mr. Evans, his talent in the field of arcane is unparalleled, he can always learn from his side. A lot of things, no matter how others attack him because of the light quantum hypothesis, I think his theory is well-founded. At the same time, thank him for opening the Atomic Research Institute so that we can use it in free time, thanking him when I occasionally want to give up, Encourage me to go on, so the ray name I used the X letter of his suffix."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerome said with affection, "Secondly, thank you Wife Vera is her gentle and considerate Except for the exhaustion of my boring and repeated experiments, her love and encouragement made me full of strength every day. Without her support behind me, I absolutely can't keep going so far. This Holm crown ring has half of her. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Diligence, persistence, seriousness and patience, regardless of talent, these are qualities worth promoting." Morris's voice is full of magnetic surnames, full of the charm of mature men. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larks smiled a bit: "Mr. Morris, we received a letter from the Arcane Masters this week, they are this Holm Crown Award. There is a common question, why is it not issued to Mr. Evans?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He obtained the Ice and Snow Medal of the surname element, which is normally enough to get twice Holm crown, once proved that electrons belong to the internal structure of the atom, once by emitting new elements, initially revealing the mystery of material changes and the microscopic world, which makes us feel tidal, seems to have mastered the true face of matter, and entered the gods. The restricted area, can be such an important paper, why did you not get the Holm Crown Award?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morris silenced, said quietly: "Proof of electronics It belongs to the internal structure of the atom and is a supplementary part of the discovery of electrons. After discussion, we believe that since Evans has already obtained the 'electronic' ring, this result should not be awarded the Holm Crown Award."<br /><br /> & Nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The emission of new elements does involve the mystery of the production and change of matter, but it is still a guess, and when Evans discovers that the material of the surname is changed into another element due to the emission of new elements, this The Holm Crown Award will undoubtedly belong to him. I hope he can come up with a set of theories of atomic structure and material change." This is only used once...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larks gave a nice, slightly inhaling sound, and licked his lips: "But it's hard to be convinced, Mr. Ulysses can get the thirty-first piece by experimenting with accurate electronic charge. The Holm Crown Award, why can't you prove that electrons belong to the atomic internal structure?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw from some of the Arcanists' letters, they suspected It is the heartache of Lord Morris, who believes that Evans has already taken three of them and should not waste the treasury of the will of the element, so he denied his fourth Holm Crown Award. For these rumors, Lord Morris Not intending to clarify one "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is an unfounded and ridiculous accusation. We discussed the meeting of the Holm Crown Award winners in a fair, just and open manner. Evans also participated in the discussion and did not raise any objections.” There was some anger in Morris’s voice, and then he paused. “The scheduled guest time is up. I will not accept such absurd interviews unless I can make an appointment. Improve a little 'sincerity'."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you always feel that Mr. Morris’s tone is dim, and Black, who listens to the radio, feels the scum he has just grown. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The news on Wednesday is here, let’s see what happened on Thursday?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...The magic steam engine and the truth-themed airship of the parliamentary patrol re-friction along the coast of the stormy strait. As the location of the mysterious space approaches lock, similar frictions become more intense, we must do well Prepare."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the beginning of the destruction of the ancient magical empire, our magician fell into a situation of collapse and retreat, near complete extinction until the establishment of the parliament, our situation It’s getting better, so this is an irreconcilable contradiction between the enemy and the enemy. Every sober magician should recognize this, and any gestures on both sides of the map are very stupid.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have no way to retreat, we are behind Aringe!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Member of the highest panel of judges, President of the 'Elemental Will', led by Donald Nearly 100 Elemental Masters and Necromancers paid a friendly visit to the Elf Kings and the Druid Presbyterian Church in Stroop Forest, and received a warm reception from the legendary Druid Malfurion. The two sides exchanged the recent situation. Opinions, reached a consensus, and held a grand 'spring planting' ceremony in the estate near Strup, and the improved alchemy item 'Golden 822 822' appeared for the first time in the world."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...Member of the highest panel, the Archaic Storm dominated the paper, and found that a small amount of particles deflected from the atomic stream bombarding the metal foil, which overturned The atomic structure model proposed by Lord Hathaway, that is, the model of the embedded electrons on the nucleus... He believes that the internal structure of the atom should be similar to that of the celestial body system of Lord Douglas, and the electrons run around the nucleus like the planet surrounds the sun... macro The world is strikingly similar to the microscopic world!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
