			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crisp and pleasant ringing of the class is still echoing in this magic tower. Nearly 30 apprentices in the "Thorn Tree" class have already seen Lucien. Hesitantly took the practice papers that had been collected and left, and did not stop at all, so they enthusiastically began to discuss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annick, Heidi, Reyia, do you know this Mr. X?" I noticed their unusual reaction before, the squad leader Grant was curious Asked, he was wearing a white shirt, a small suit, a black curly hair and a pair of deep black eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other apprentices also cast their eyes on it. I want to know more about this unique teacher. Annick nodded gently: "Yes, we know Evan." Mr. Si. "For the squad leader with high arcane talent, good spiritual talent and good popularity, he has always respected and admired. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant said: "That's great! Is Mr. Evans so cool? It doesn't matter if you don't have to listen to my class, as long as you can pass The final assessment?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one has ever dared to say this, they always want to concentrate on them when we are in class, old-fashioned and annoying How can Mr. Evans be so open and so cool! I have to know that sometimes I have learned the knowledge and I have already understood it. There is no need to waste it on it. Is it better to learn more?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if I met a confidant, it seems to be convinced by Lucien's style different from other teachers. Grant is very excited, and he follows Annick as Mr. Evans. Other apprentices also felt that Lucian was so cool that he did not care about the seriousness of the apprentices. He only cares about the final assessment. Heidi licked his teeth and was very serious and dignified: "Mr. Evans does not care much about students. Their seriousness and concentration, because he often hangs on his lips is: 'You learn the art of arcane and magic for yourself, not for me, if you can't be a formal magician, sad, bad future is not me. Why should I take care of what attitude you use? 'However, this is only his side, the other side..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s words are simple and easy to understand, Apprentices, including Sprint and Katrina, are nowhere to be, and even if they don’t have a teacher, the yearning for the status, status and strength of the official magician is also full of motivation and pressure. Although some people will look down on hard training, no one will slack off, so their goodwill towards Lucian is once again elevated. He feels that he is a good friend of the apprentices, and he is a maverick to a cool teacher! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the other side of Mr. Evans?" Grant was very curious about Lucien and noticed that Heidi’s words were not finished. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of the exercises just now and the experience of the past, Heidi and Lei Yili replied in unison: "After a while, you will know, I hope you will Don't hate Mr. Evans too much!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, why hate?" Grant and other apprentices felt that they would only worship such teachers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick, Heidi, and Reyaliya shook their heads neatly: "You will understand when you are." It seems that others are suffering as much as they are. Is it a happy thing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In curiosity, the apprentices began the second quarter of "Magic Pharmacy (Preliminary)". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............In the teacher’s office of the official apprentice class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took the test paper and just stepped into the room. There were three men, two women and five teachers who looked up from the desk and smiled, while the other seven teachers still Buried your head or prepare to teach content or analyze your own magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing their smile, Lucien bowed his head and went back in the morning. When he arrived in the morning, he was still worried that others would be surprised to question that he only had seven Arcane points. Can enter the Douglas Magic School, I can't think of Rock's mouth to say anything, so the five teachers who have a good relationship with Roque have expressed goodwill and enthusiasm to Lucien, and the other seven magic teachers who are not worthy of him. It became neither cold nor hot, and almost turned a blind eye to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if they don’t discuss the nature of their mental power with them, they don’t have the freedom to marry an ancient inheritance magic that has no official arcane ranks. division. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, an introduction to ancient magical language and magical creatures, and there is no difficulty in teaching. You should take the time to make up the base of the arcane." The blond female magician Vernier, who was going to class, passed the Lucian desk and kindly reminded him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the close distance and the dual identity of the magician and the nobility, she only needs two Yinnars back and forth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled politely: "Ms. Vernier, thank you for your reminder, I will remember."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I like Lu Xien, your polite and handsome young man. If you are free to Rantat, you must come to my house to be a guest." As a married woman Ms. Vernier is not as shy as she was when she was unmarried. She smiled and sang a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire magic school, the female surname magic teacher probably accounts for about one-third, has a beautiful appearance, also has a good looks, ordinary temperament, and even magic experiments Failure or long-term erosion by the magical energy of a faction learned, looks terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Vernier left, Lucien took the test paper out and browsed it. He probably understood the ancient magical language level of the "Thorn Tree" class, and then took it. Feather pen and paper, began to review and consolidate the two-ring magic "mirror shadow" that has been resolved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After fighting with the Fishman Mage, Lucian is very interested in this magic that can get rid of the lock, plus it is the basic magic of the illusion system, "Star There is also a book with elements, so Lucien is going to use it as the first two-ring magic he built, and he is promoted to a second-ring magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Douglas Magic School, "Magic Experiment Tower". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the end of the last section of the "Introduction to Magical Creatures" class, Lucien was in a hurry to leave the "Blood Bird" class and arrived here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, I want to use an alchemy lab." Lucien politely talks to the old magician who manages the "Magic Experiment Tower." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This old magician is called Ines, the level is the first two rings, and the age seems not small, I don’t know why I can enter the magic school as a magic experiment. The manager of the tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wrinkled face has no smile, and the official business is authentic: "Mr. Evans, sorry, the magic lab is full, you come early tomorrow." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The magic lab is full?" Lucien looked up at the five-story magic tower, although it was not broad, but at least one layer Ten magic labs, how can it be so fast? ! Ines flatly replied: "Mr. Evans, the Magic Lab has to set aside 20 apprentices who are diligent and like to do magic experiments. They have the right place to practice after dinner. After all, this is a magic school. Except for the labs that are reserved for several second-level arcans, other magic labs are used by the first-time teachers. Sorry, you It’s late.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There are so many teachers who need to do magic experiments?” Lucien asked with a bit of frustration and amazement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ines nodded: "Many of them are not doing real magic experiments, but relying on alchemy and magical arrays in the laboratory to refine pharmaceutical agents and articles. And experimenting with the correctness of your own magical structure or summoning ritual, does not cost a lot of expensive materials, just like the magic apprentices do."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Evans, you know, the biggest expectation for teachers to enter the magic school is to use the magic lab for free."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, I understand. But Irene Mr., are there really no empty magic labs? For example, those left to the second-class arcian or apprentices, let me use them first, and when they come, I will come out, can I?" Lucien never People who are not easily retreating in the face of problems, keep thinking about ways. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it’s not the formal magic lab that needs a lot of material to portray the magical array, etc., the money that Lucy is now able to bear, Lucien has long been Build an exclusive lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ines firmly shook his head: "No, I can't violate the rules. Unless Mr. Evans becomes a second-level arcian, he has privileges." Br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the level of the Arcana Division is increased, there may be no privilege in addition to the symbolic level of the magician. I am afraid that many magicians will not do this. I am keen on specializing in arcane surgery. For them, the basics of arcanes are enough to learn by magic, which directly represents strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
