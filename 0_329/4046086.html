			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the longest and most marked mark of Lucien. Even the "Emden" that does not agree on the graphics is a direct written word, which makes the corner change. It’s fancy and messy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do all this, Lucien just left the corner of the house, and with the ability of half moonlight, walked quietly to his hut and then hid In the dark shadows, intently sense the condition inside the cabin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the night watchman has left, the supernatural powers in the hut feel reappeared, and Lucien sees the appearance of that kind of magic by the moonlight through the gap, it It was a pair of almost transparent eyes, pale without pupils, floating in the cabin halfway, staring quietly at the raised blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strange and horrible scene will scare every ordinary person, but Lucien is only a little glad to say: "Fortunately, this kind of magic does not fuse. The ability to check infra-red, otherwise the blankets where the heat has been lost can easily be seen abnormally."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the dark shadow, Lucien waited quietly until After half an hour, the transparent eyes disappeared due to the duration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Lucien immediately focused and sensed that a wave of supernatural powers flowed from the other side of the corner, and then another pair in the room. The pale, transparent eyes slowly emerged from the darkness of nothingness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It turned out that he was hiding there." Lucien looked at the corner and bounced the small stone in his hand in the opposite direction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, the sound of the stone landing jump is very obvious on an unusually quiet night, the pale, transparent eyes swayed violently and quickly shattered and disappeared, it seems The cult priest was scared by this sudden sound at the crucial moment of the display of the magical powers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with this opportunity, Lucien lifted the speed to the limit, the semi-lighted body dragged the afterimage, and in the silver moon shines like a cleansing In the light, if you don't look carefully, you can't find it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road is very close, and Lussien quickly ran to the wooden window, pushed the wooden window that was actually unlocked, jumped in, and gently Closed, and then the cult priest was given the opportunity to adjust to the failure of the genius, and ran to the bed to lie down and covered the blanket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be vigilant, perhaps checking the reason for the stone landing. After a full minute, Lucien felt the resurgence of supernatural power in the cabin again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next ten minutes, Lucien pretended to roll over the blanket and let the pale, transparent eyes see him directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no abnormality, no problem at all, the cultist can only attribute the situation to a wild cat or a bird, and completely relieve it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien saw that for a long time the other side did not move, judging that he was successfully passing, and began to sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can't successfully stimulate your blood, Lucien can only wait for the dawn, and you can let the poor get out of bed, and the cults look for opportunities to monitor from the magic. Come out in the lab. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky is lit, Lucien has gone out after breakfast. Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In front of the office of the "Department of Affairs" on the third floor, Lucien knocked on the half-open door, a middle-aged woman with a hair-haired, well-dressed When I came over, I looked at Lucien carefully and asked with a little uncertainty: "Mr. Evans? Are you looking for Brian?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes I have something to find Brian." Lucien saw that Brian in the office had come out because he had heard the conversation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian is slightly nervous: "Mr. Evans, is there a problem with the villa?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, but the quilt and blankets are very wet. I hope you can find someone to help me with the sun and clean the villa before the next week." Lucien smiled and told me that it was a simple expression. Little things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the Ministry of Affairs, Lucien returned to his exclusive lounge, feeling much better than yesterday, his strength has been greatly improved, and he is qualified to save people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the abnormal ecstasy of their emotions from being monitored, Lucien began the practice of the piano, and since he had already stimulated the blood, Lucien’s hands The control and coordination of both feet has been raised to a high level. With super memory, many difficult fingering techniques that need to be practiced for a long time are very easy to master. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, after adaptation and two or three times of practice, the melody of fate, piano etude and other proficient melody, Lu Xien is more smooth than ever, fully achieved A standard for qualified musicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s no wonder that Rhein said that after inspiring blood pressure, with good memory, you can become a qualified pianist in one or two weeks." Lucy I remember the words of Rhine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the knight-level powerhouse is not difficult to use as long as he is willing to practice, but to master and reach the master's level still requires musical talent and long The persistence of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Moonlight Rose was handed over to Lucien, Felice believed that the agreement between the two parties had officially begun to be fulfilled, so they were not willing to waste time and came directly in the morning. Lucian practiced together and asked her about the problem of a piece of music she had been trying to compose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foundation of Lucien music is actually not as solid as Felice, only the melody she wrote can be retrieved in the soul library, and then follow those The change of famous songs to guide, although one morning, Lucien only put forward two or three opinions, but Felice has been very satisfied, after changing according to the guidance of Lucien, she soon found a new inspiration to fill The music is much better than before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your musical talent is amazing." Feili's ruby-like eyes stare at Lucien with deep admiration. And a faint worship, there is no doubt about the name of Lucian music genius, even if someone questions, she will be the first person to stand up and refute, "and your piano playing skills are also a lot more skilled, see After a full month of practicing such a complicated piece of music, you have broken through the bottleneck and entered the stage of rapid improvement."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien can only use this The most standard courtesy smile to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon, Lucien returned to the association after lunch, and returned The cabin, which continues to pack up a few items, is brought to the villas rented by Jisu District. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quilt, blanket, etc. have been sun-dried on the balcony of the villa. Lucien’s appearance is normal and natural, but the heart is slightly nervous and worried to enter the master bedroom, the envelope I found it out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is the sinister church suspecting me because I left the stationery here yesterday? Will it punish me? Will it harm the safety of Uncle Joel?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With so many worries, Lucien took out the stationery, unwinding slowly, the heart beats slowly, and it seems that even the breathing is stagnant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The letterhead slowly spread out, there have been two new lines of words on it, and the dark and dull handwriting is unbearable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, please be sure to fix your place of residence so that it is prone to leaks."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Seeing these words, Lucien deliberately reveals the expression of doubt, the heartbeat returns to normal, and the breathing rhythm returns to normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think of yourself as an ordinary person, as an ordinary person who can't recognize the magical items, then yesterday's every move is a normal negligence change, and in addition to the stationery And the cult priests used the "Tiger Mosquito" and the genius to monitor, and their performance did not lead to suspicion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that they still don't want me to know the important surname of this letter." Lucian thought, and replied: "I will live in this week. You have to give way to the district."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New words on the letterhead emerged: "That will bring the stationery back to facilitate the connection between us. Are you right? Mr. Evans ?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
