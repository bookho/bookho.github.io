			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosion stopped, the building did not tremble again, but many knights and ordinary people still felt the ears creak, like there are countless flies in Flying, nothing can be heard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Knight who went to the location of the explosion with Viscount Wright returned to the adventurer to watch the night: "Broken a wall, a few pillars, destroyed four For one of the wax museums, fortunately there is no wax image on there, and no one has passed. Now the Viscount and two other adults are extinguishing the attached flame there, let me come over and remind you to be careful not to be attacked by chaos. He judges Either a medium alchemy explosive, or a four-ring magician bombarded with a fireball."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of each magic is fixed, but the power will be used The strength of the person increases rapidly and the fireball of the four-ring magician and the three-ring magician is not a concept in destructive power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adventurer watchman nodded: "Several adults, Mr. Brown and other knights responded quickly and correctly, not hiding for those mice." The timid magicians have the opportunity. I hope my companion has already caught the archer, and I am going to use the magical items to call other night watchers, so that there are people who will not rush to attack on the way back."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuous attack but did not find the assassin, really let the night watchman feel bad, and the ambush can not ask the bishop and pastor to do it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s best if you are so cautious, the Viscount adult has never been as angry as it is now." The knight turned and walked to Soge, ready to tell the Viscount Wright The words of comfort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Olyev, it’s best to let me go right away, it’s too dangerous." Brown panicked, slightly insane. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This vigil, called Oliyav, understands Brown’s emotional state. The successive attacks are really scary and fearful, and Brown is not a real knight. There is a lot of will on the will: "Mr. Brown, when the night watchman I convened came, I will send you home."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, actually Not three attacks have been thunderous and heavy, and an assassin has not appeared. Brown's status will not be so bad. As long as the assassin appears, Brown should be able to stabilize the mood, because the unknown waiting is the most irritating, especially when this is unknown and scary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long do you have to wait? Why not look for the pastor or bishop of the nearby church?" Brown was afraid and angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olyev shrugged his shoulders: "This kind of thing, those who are bathed in the light, the noble pastors and bishops how to do it? Unless we can Surrounding the assassins, they will take the rush."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown looks a little restless: "Olyev, I don't want to live like this anymore, I don't want to be a bait anymore! I want to go to the holy city soon!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. Brown, calm, calm. So there is no real attack, but the Magic Council lacks more The means, without sacrificing the courage of a mid-level magician, you will never be in danger." Oliyav comforted two sentences and then said, "I immediately use my magical items to convene my companions."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Olyedev please hurry up." Brown trembled anxiously, and his fears grew louder and louder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get out of here, there is a lot of danger here!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get away, right away There are high-level magicians who directly destroy the wax museum!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear in his heart seems to have turned into countless urging voices, making his nerves more tense, There is a feeling of being mad by the fear of depression, and the angel feathers on his body disappear a little with his movement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hurry! Go! Go!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"咚!咚!咚!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shouts and heartbeats seem to merge into one, so that Brown feels that he can no longer afford it. Seeing that Oliyav is in contact with people, his eyes are slightly flashing, and then his head is also Go back to the gate without going back to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd outside the wax museum had escaped from the explosion and became empty. Brown did not run back, although he did not know where he wanted to run. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Wax Museum, Olliev, who is in contact with other night watchers, will not react until Brown rushes out of the gate. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good!" He followed him up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown ran out of a dozen meters, suddenly a strong sense of danger from the bottom of his heart, let him wake up from the state of extreme panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oops!" Brown knew it was wrong, but at this time there was already a fire in front of him, and a skull-sized fireball hit his upper body directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While being hit by the fireball, Brown subconsciously looked at the direction in which the fireball flew. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a scene in the red fire of the pupil at the corner of the wax museum, a young man wearing a tall black hat was pushing him with his left hand. The monocle, the flame on the wrist will not be scattered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rumble, the fireball exploded, the upper body of Brown was torn apart, and the burning flame destroyed the regenerative capacity of his cells, leaving him completely dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Olyev just heard the loud explosion when he ran to the gate, and his mind suddenly came up with an intuitive idea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Brown is over..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The members of the Magic Council are really in us Under the protection of the night watchman and the knight, Brown was killed?!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anger, ridiculous, frustrated and other emotions echoed in Olivey’s mind, but he still did not follow. Stopping the ground and rushing out, trying to grasp the hope of shackles. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless blackened corpses falling on the ground, only the lower half is still intact. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olyev’s heart plunged into the dark abyss, no hope, Brown really died! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed, the anger that cannot be suppressed goes straight to the mind, and Oleyev’s eyes are slightly reddened from the position of Brown’s body to determine the direction of the attack, loudly The big knights and knights who came behind said: "The assassin is there!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under his leadership, a group of people chased the corner of the wax museum . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when they got to the corner, there was no one there. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of another big bang, the roadway between the two buildings was empty, and the other party used magic to process the traces and it looked It is calm and unhurried. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chasing!" How can Olyeev give up and continue to chase the laneway, but this island has many art buildings, and the lanes between them are dense like spider webs. The night watchmen who scouted the gods and traced the gods were led by the previous incitement. They could only rely on a few traces of residuals and kept chasing them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, Oliyav chased the other side of the island, and the remaining traces of the remains disappeared completely, and many canals on the canal Come and go, it is impossible to tell which ship the assassin was on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only a second level, but because of the special blood, the key moment The night watchman who was able to erupt briefly out of the strength of the third-level knight was stunned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he refused to give up and contacted the captain of the night watchman, the bishop looked down from the air and tried to find traces in other directions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The bathroom in the high-end restaurant on the bank of the canal behind Oleyev is in the window compartment, and Lucien’s hand is in flames. The black dress, shirt and trousers burned, and a dark red shirt, matching trousers and shoes were replaced. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the dress when Lucien came out today. The previous top hat, black dress, monocle, etc. were hidden in the night before waiting for the "ferry" This bathroom is concealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
