			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the endless silver moon glory, a thin black seam appears, getting bigger and bigger, finally clearly visible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a long sword wrapped around a black flame. It seems that the black flame can burn and destroy everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis in the distance only felt that the darkness seemed to absorb all the light, creating a slow pause in time and making absolute solidification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he quickly understood that this was just his own illusion, and the darkness revealed the dark green color and the bright light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness covered everything again, then quickly disappeared, Lucien floated in the air, and the "pale justice" clenched in his right hand had already flown across the Sonar River. Inserted in front of Natasha, it seems that she clicked on her, the left hand was really powerless to hang down, and her face was as ugly as a piece of white paper. This hit, Aitna not only consumed all the accumulated power, but also took the road to the road. The power of the blood after the transformation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temple of War together with the mountain where it is located has been completely annihilated, Congos is dumbly placed on the top, Rudolph II descended from the body of the Bero The world fell to the ground, and the order balance of black and white in front of the body disappeared, as if it had been projected before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night's slightly cool wind blew gently, and the black cloak and magic robes on Congers trembled and turned into countless pieces, revealing a white and smooth inside. The skeleton, then the skeleton is like a blend of a drop of gray liquid dripping on the ground, letting the cracked earth lose the last trace of vitality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire skeleton of Congers is damaged, the skull is also broken, and the two needles illuminate like a candle in the wind, but under the white skull, it is exposed. A small, golden skull with extremely terrifying power, and a needle-like red awning in the golden eye socket. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can't run away!" Congers, who only had a golden skull, opened and closed the two rows of teeth, and said coldly to Lucien. One sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing, his golden skull also showed a horrible crack, and then disappeared in a remnant quaint ring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oops, he left the resurrection item nearby." Lucien was sinking inside,<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;;;; Although Lucien has long understood that Etna absorbed two deaths of the surname, the attack of full force is only equivalent to the level of Congos, the long-dead Rudolph II, but only intrinsically suppressed The effect, I did not expect to be able to kill a lot of life-saving means, the sacred sorcerer and the sorcerer who did not know where to hide, and Rudolf II, who has not yet come true, but also hopes from the heart Can completely destroy the body of Congos, let him resurrect from the amulet that is definitely located in the main material world, one after another, he is safe and worry-free, and the reality ruthlessly destroyed Lucian's expectations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this didn’t make Lucien fear, he had the speciality of his fate, and he met Natasha. Then he just had to be careful to go to the Magic Council. There is no need to worry about the pursuit of Congos. He will take at least half an hour to resurrect, and the most important thing is...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it, Lucy The graceful light moved to the black-and-white ash solidified debris floating in the air. Only by absorbing them, the power of Aitna recovered, and Congers dared to chase it? I am afraid there is extra to run extra! At the level of the gods, Etna will surely annihilate all his traces like the sword of truth! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an inexplicable smile on the face of the "God of the Gods" on the dead earth, and then the whole body became a powder and collapsed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And El, Natasha, Camille, Francis, Danielle, etc. are either unconscious or left in the same place, no one can make The extra action, turned into an undead creature, Axin still retains his intellect and dare not approach Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hungry!" Lucien’s left hand stretched forward again, flying with his body, and pressed it in a black-and-white ash solidified debris. On the top, several pieces around are also pulled and slowly merged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the sound of Lucien’s ear disappeared, the color disappeared, only the pure black and white gray remained, and the other things beyond one meter were completely blurred, then In order to chaos, the whole person is isolated from the world, and even the mind becomes solid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "purification fire" Danielle twisted his neck, his face showed a strange smile, then slowly stood up, carrying a long sword, flew to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know that this kind of projection is hard to destroy, but so boldly absorb the 'essence' fragment, I should say that you will think about the process of absorption too simple, Or have you become arrogant and changed your mind?" The voice of Danielle's mouth is full of majesty, and it is Rudolf II! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his breath still does not reach the legend, it seems that there is no surname of the surname as the carrier of the advent, it is impossible to achieve a higher level of advent, will be limited by being The strength of the adventurous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, what did the father say about Lucien? Evans knows that his projections are hard to destroy?" Sophia end in the aristocratic district of Husum’s other direction. Sitting on the bed, floating in front of a small black and white balance, she is using this "artifact" power and "projection common" to watch the battle near the Temple of War, and is puzzled by Rudolf II's words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More than three years ago, the Sun King Palace made her hate the "unforgettable", trying to find the mysterious magician, but unfortunately there was no clue. So gradually put down, focus on improving their level of warlock, and the two magics submitted by Lucien in the previous period, because of the simple principle, many magicians have imitated the creation of similar spells, sharing the attention of intelligence personnel, no special Logo, Sophia has not read the relevant news, it is not clear that his great enemy is Lucien? Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudolph II is the legendary powerhouse of the Arcanist level, and the projection of the legendary power through the surname of the surname, plus Lucian Deliberately concealing the breath and the feeling of the soul, naturally recognized by him at a glance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declared two sentences to show that he was not a sneak attack, Rudolf II raised the "purification fire" sword and slammed against the moonlight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speed of the sword is extremely strange, and the reflection of the silver moon is "sparkling", which seems to bring the taste of kindness, honesty, trustworthiness, order and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white long sword with a burning pattern looks at the head of Xi’an’s head. Suddenly, a sleek, ordinary ordinary sword is inserted , blocked in front of the "purification fire." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the sound of a crisp sound, the fire of purification bounced back, and the holder of the sword also stepped back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You haven't taken off yet?" Rudolph II looked at the beautiful woman with a firm expression and firm eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congers has concentrated the main force of the life ritual and its filthy rain on Annathan, but that is the aftermath of legendary magic. It’s not surprising that Natasha, who can’t kill the full defense and outfits well, is amazing, but she’s so alive and kicking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because at the beginning, Lucien used 'Wind News' to remind me to be careful about the level of legendary level, so I was ready for it, though Destroyed two pieces of equipment, and consumed only the power of Amir Kamil. I didn’t lose anything. Instead, the time of the life ritual restored the fatigue of the previous fight with Anantans.” Natasha’s silver-purple eyes died. Staring at Rudolph II, clenching the sword, moving forward, and sticking to the place.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a "pale justice" in her hand. And its own nine-level "Replica of Truth Shield", the eight-level knight's sword "balanced sword" are destroyed in the two battles that have just entangled Annatans and resisted the legendary magic, and the pale justice is due to The legendary magic of the Necromancer is equivalent to the legendary long sword. It was spared and was deliberately thrown into her by Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that he already knew that Congos would appear." Rudolph II sighed, and then a sword waved and launched a stormy attack. The surrounding space becomes hot and all the dirt is burned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "purification fire" Danielle after his projection was upgraded to the level of the advanced gold knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha is steadfastly defending this time, applying the skill of the hilt, the blade, and the sword of his own truth to the skill, keeping it dripping. The continuous collision of the cymbals sounded like a sound, and it became a series of rushing notes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she has only seven levels, in the pale justice, but also eight levels of attack and defense, and "Golden Knight level" Rudolph II There is no small gap, it is impossible to insist on it for a long time, but Rudolf II is not an excellent epic knight, but embarked on a balanced alternative road, and before the attack of Aitna also greatly hurts The power of his projections made him unable to play many of the "Flaming Angels" spell-like abilities. Therefore, Natasha's skills and top bloodlines greatly compensated for the gap. After a minute, they still did not retreat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
