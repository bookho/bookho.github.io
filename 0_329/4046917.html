			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Calling like seeing a ghost." Along with the low and whistling sound outside the door, the door slammed open, a boy with a messy hair When he came in, his eyelids were swollen, and his pale blue eyes were bloodshot, as if he had not had a good rest for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And behind him, a white and fuzzy figure clung to him tightly, his feet off the ground, drifting forward, as it appeared, The whole bedroom suddenly became cold and seemed to return to the early spring of the early spring, and it was chilling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey shuddered and hurriedly put on the long dress that was taken off next: "Sami, I see the ghost behind you every day, and Fear of ghosts? Besides, there are really evil spirits, and the teachers of the Necronomics must laugh and catch them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the school of magic The downside is that there is no space for ghost legends. Unlike the general school, there are often similar stories, such as hanging a girl in a laboratory, so when I experiment alone at night, I often encounter experiments. The inexplicable loss of material, or the much-needed material that was originally far away, suddenly appears at hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are also many legends in the magic school. For example, the sorrowful old Master who is obeying the anatomy room will often conduct live research, so he will live there all the year round. Not going out, it would be so violent to refuse anyone to approach his room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami made a yawn: "So how do you call it so miserable? You are a good apprentice in our top 20."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghost hands behind him suddenly stretched like a rubber band, grabbed a cup and a kettle, poured a full cup and fed it to Sami's mouth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The best apprentice, in the face of so many formulas, equations, concepts, principles, magical runes, spell models, will also feel that the head will explode, even if Now it's just the most succinct and simplest to learn." Downey licked his forehead and whispered in his heart. So many theories, formulas, equations, constants, and models all have the prefix of Lucien or Evans. Not irritating to want to cross the past to kill the lord. Avoid these tormenting things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Downey sighed: "And I don't have a 'lucid necklace' and no 'energy ring', not like you, born with A spirit behind. The Necromancer spell is very well mastered. It has been booked by the Heidel School of Magic. For me, everything can only be on my own. It is not allowed to fail. It will always be exhausted and violent for a long time." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is quite familiar with his psychological situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sami bowed his head and drank again, and yawned again without image: "Your psychoanalysis in the field of illusion is really good, this suppression is venting Just fine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he lazily fell on his bed, his eyes closed, vaguely said: "The spirit behind is very troublesome. Your energy will affect your state, will... will make the girl afraid to approach you, if it is during the rule of truth, I will be directly tied to the firearms... If it were not my natural soul, born The location is also special. It is very difficult for the spirit to be removed without harming itself. I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he fell asleep. Breathing light, if there is no such thing. And the spirit behind it lies under him and hugs him tightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie looked at his roommate and sighed softly. If you disliked it, I wouldn’t envy it. Anyway, if you become a formal mage in the future, those The female magician is not afraid of what is behind the spirit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He listened to Sami, he was a twin, but his mother was physically damaged due to being in the gap between the dead spirits. When he was born, one of the babies already dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the god, Downey regained his calmness, aside from the review of The Basics of Arcane and the History of Arcane and Magic, focusing on the spelling Exercises for model analysis. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow, I should also have a "wake necklace"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the horrible curse and a little bit cold and cold The powder slipped, and a tangled light line was entangled in the cold, and a thick layer of hoarfrost was frozen on the target, which was just the throat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, today's spell practice is over." The teacher in charge of the actual magical guidance took a clap and signaled the end of today's class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donnie hurriedly stopped, collected the casting materials, and screamed with Sami, who was as if he could never sleep forever, hurriedly rushed to The platform outside the school. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today is Sunday, and there is no class in the afternoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nearly forty minutes later, the 36 public transport bus arrived at the Arc de Triomphe, and Downey walked into the “Knowledge Bookstore”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good afternoon, sir." Downey greeted him, then he didn't know what to say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss with a pair of owl-like eyes and a deep yellow beard smiled and said: "Good afternoon, come on time, I am ready to wake up the necklace and The contract."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, he took out a pale gold necklace on top of the necklace, inlaid with five gravel-sized pale blue gems. They exude a faint coolness, as if there is a clear spring inside, and each other's position just constitutes a mutated pentagram. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's the official magic item-level 'awake necklace'..." Although he hasn't learned the appraisal, Downey has also used basic alchemy items in school. The identification class, such an obvious volatility feature, allowed him to recognize the true grade of the necklace at a glance, and his heart became excited and confused. Lord Evans once said that the gift for no reason is hidden in most cases. Conspiracy, whether this conspiracy is good or bad. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss touched his beard and smiled and said: "Just rent it to you, not to you."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I am a very utilitarian person. I am doing good things in order to get a return. Although I am renting it cheaply now, but if you become a formal magician in the future, if I have something to help you, Within the scope of your abilities, would you not agree? I am equivalent to a long-term investment that does not harm my own interests."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With roads, railroad tracks With the improvement of infrastructure, with the popularization of similar things promoted by magic cars, magic steam trains, steam giant ships, aircraft and small fission devices, the exchange of goods around the world has become more convenient, and the banking industry has also flourished, making many innovations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing the boss’s answer, Downey was relieved. Although he still wonders if he seems to be quite optimistic about himself, he is not too concerned about it. If you invest, it is the relationship between the eyes and the connections. He quickly picked up the contract next to him. Looked carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the contract points in the school of magic, Downey reviewed it one by one, and the contract was simple. There was no place for disagreement at all, so Downey quickly got the conclusion. He gritted his teeth and picked up his feather pen to sign his real name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little pale flame emerged, burning the contract quickly, but at the same time rubbing out two copies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The contract is established, take this necklace." The boss handed the necklace to Downey. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey took control of the necklace according to the standard process and put it directly around his neck, suddenly feeling a cool flow throughout the body. The anxiety and depression that have been coming for many days have all been swept away, and it has never been more refreshing and comfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Donnie." The boss suddenly said, "Which school do you plan to apply for in the "Universal Entrance Examination for High School of Magic"? Holt? Tower? Heidler? Or others?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently nine high schools of magic in the entire Magic Council, of which Holt College is in the microscopic, elemental, and other fields. The college is in the macroscopic field, such as astrology and cosmology. Heidler College is longer in the fields of necromantics, genetics, medical treatment, etc., and different colleges need to add different content, so in the more than one month before the “Uniform Entrance Examination”, students will choose the college they want to apply for. . It is convenient for the final exam arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downey is going to answer Holt College because it is the first high school in Parliament, and the arcane teacher who teaches is powerful and knowledgeable. Longer than the most wonderful microscopic field that most involves the world and the essence of magic, who does not yearn for it? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
