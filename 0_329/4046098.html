			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver of the carriage is a 40-year-old driver. When the old count was alive, he was already a "Bern" manor, and he had transported many nobles. The carriage was running smoothly and abnormally, so that Lucien in the carriage could not feel it completely. This is the ordinary road between the manors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking quietly about things, after a long time, Lucien found that the carriage stopped. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, already outside the manor of Sir Wien, need me to inform?" The coachman whispered back, in his experience, An elegant gentleman will not talk to the goalkeeper without falling down. This kind of thing is done by a servant or a driver. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently smiled: "No, my friend is also a knight, I am not taller than him."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as it can stimulate blood power, the status of the official knight is much higher than that of ordinary musicians. It is a real aristocrat. Of course, Lucien is now a quasi-knight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gatekeeper is Ian and Dorag who Lucien once met, when they saw the carriage with the Hein family flame bull badge When I arrived at the gate of the manor, I immediately stood up and prepared for the distinguished guests. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what surprised them was that they came out of the carriage and saw one side before, and they overwhelmed themselves by drinking and making themselves impressed. The poor boy, and he is wearing a white wide-sleeved shirt, a black formal jacket, and a handsome and elegant appearance, like a real aristocrat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazed, until Lucien stopped in front of them, Ian came back to God: "Hello, are you coming to John?" "The carriage of the Haien family, and Lucien, who is completely like a person, has made Ian temporarily forget the humiliation of the past and is full of courtesy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, trouble you to tell John." Lucien almost forgot Ian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ian nodded and said good, and he turned to walk into the manor. At this time Dorrag said hesitantly: "Excuse me, are you Mr. Evans?" ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the success of the concert at the St. Mary's Hall, even if John is not a person who loves to show off and loves to brag, he can't help but talk about it in his companion. The story of his friend Evans, his musical talent and previous experience, will be an unprecedented response to the concert, and the praises of the Grand Duke, the cardinal and the princess will be repeated, so the past is a poor, now When he was picked up by the Haien family carriage, Doral quickly connected him to the talented musician Evans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I am a good friend of John." Lucian answered quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dorag said with some excitement: "I have heard of your 'destiny', just in the banquet of Sir Wien a few days ago, it is an unparalleled work. I really like it too much, please forgive me for my previous attitude towards you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enthusiastic, sincere, excited, Lucien did not expect Dorrag or one A literary youth who really loves music, this is not very harmonious with his thick arms and strong chest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, here is Aalto, this kind of thing is normal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you for your compliment, I am very happy and proud." Lucien responded politely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ian’s smiling smile said: “You are Mr. Evans, and you have forgotten the previous impoliteness.”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not a fanatical music lover of Dorag, but his serviced Cavalier Wien is very fond of and respectful of the Symphony of Destiny, even at the banquet. Therefore, he had to express goodwill on the surface, but in the heart, Ian still hates Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Lucien can only feel his identity and status changes, and the attitudes of others around him will also change dramatically. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Ian went in to find John, Dorrag was still in the middle of excitement. He rubbed his hand and looked at Lucien, but he didn’t know what to say. It’s hard to squeeze a word: “Mr. Evans, can I invite you to my house?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, John followed Ian out and asked in disbelief: "How did Lucien come over, I will go back at noon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Lucien told the cultist John to go home on Saturday and not to lie, but to advance the time a little longer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some things that have been solved, go to the carriage and say." Lucien pulled John on the carriage, and the old coachman was very interested in the horses on the stakes. Attached to the line, I walked aside and took out a leaf similar to tobacco and ignited it under the nose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John knows that Lucien is not a reckless person, and although he is full of doubts, he listens carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucian’s remarks, John’s face gradually became blue and his hands were tightly held. When he heard the three broken fingers, his mouth was even more He made a sound of tooth biting, but he kept quiet, didn't yell, didn't yell, and waited until Lucine finished speaking, only to sigh for a long time, and couldn't speak for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien accompanied him to calm his emotions and did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, you don't have to blame yourself, even though you became the music consultant of His Royal Highness, the devil's believers were eyeing the father, mother and Ai Wen. But the fault is that they are bad guys, not you, not your motivation to pursue the music path. Even without this, as long as you or I have contact with His Majesty the Grand Duke and the Princess, they will still do the same thing. We can't take the fault of the bad guys to demand ourselves."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After John recovered a little emotion, the first thing to say is to comfort the words of Lucien, afraid of the road. Sean couldn't let go of this matter and affect his musical path. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien didn’t expect John to say this, there was a feeling of warmth, and the self-blame that did not affect the mood slowly disappeared: “Thank you. Consolation, John, I understand, we will never know that a bad guy will hurt us because of what we did."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirmed that the Joel family has been princess The Knight of His Royal Highness rescued, and John immediately said that he would take time off to visit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Wait a minute, John." Lucien took out a black bag with moonlight roses. "There are twenty grams of moonlight roses here."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John looked at the bag with dignity. Just now he knew the origin of Moonlight Rose from Lucien’s mouth. After hesitating for more than ten seconds, he firmly took the bag. There is no derogation: "Thank you, Lucien, I will certainly stimulate the blood, and only then will I be able to protect my family and protect my friends."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He did not pay back the words of Lucien, because he knew that he could not afford such a large sum of money before he motivated his blood, and if he could successfully stimulate the blood to become a knight, he would be given the identity of a real aristocrat. It is a simple matter to protect Lucien and to repay Kintal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you can't be too anxious, step by step according to Sir Wien's arrangement. Yes, John, for the other twenty grams, please be sure to I keep it secret." Lucien groaned. The reason I told John just now is that when the cultists promised to help them to stimulate their blood power, they offered to provide their own moonlight roses, so they used twenty grams, but this kind of thing is afraid of angering the princess. Did not mention, only tell Natasha is a "help" that the cult is direct and cannot be rejected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John smiles with a smile on his parents' faces: "Reassured, I am more secret than the dead."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In his opinion, Lucien is a last resort and disguise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After making up for the final omission, Lucien asked the coachman to come back and drove the carriage back to Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The Haien family carriage appeared in the slums, causing a small sensation, although most of the poor can not distinguish the coat of arms, know like the scholars The meaning of each coat of arms, but Aalto's most famous family, they still know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel, Alisa, and Avon have been sent back by the church, and there seems to be no strong intelligence from them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing John and Lucien stepping down the carriage, Ai Wen, who matured a lot, suddenly burst into tears, very sad, as if trying to remember the unpleasant, sad memory. Scour up quickly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien embraced Joel and Eliza, and incorporated apologies, fears, and joy into the hug. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s none of your business, things are gone." Joel and Eliza are so comforting Lucien, in the hands of the cultists. They all thought that they could not escape death, but they were saved by the princess's knight, which made them more tolerant and understanding besides being more faithful to the god of truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than ten minutes of mutual comfort, Lucien learned from the mouth of Joel and Eliza about the content of the church and the Principality’s intelligence, mainly to Joel knows the characteristics of some of the cultists in his mouth, and why the guards of the Cavaliers escaped when they did not have time to kill the hostages. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool and Eliza were not concentrating on the surroundings when they were abused, and then suddenly they were shocked by the loud noise, so when they wake up The knight who arrived at the princess did not know what happened in the middle. The rest of the hostages were similar. Even if a few did not faint, almost nothing was heard in the severe tinnitus. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only question that asks the inquirer is why Joel and Eliza fainted after being put up in the cell, and woke up in the cell, but This problem is combined with "why the watchman can't come to kill the hostage and escapes." Instead, he can get a more reasonable explanation and process. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s after the loud noise, because the priority is to deal with other things, and the final moments of the need to clean up the hostages, so the guards will throw them back. The cell, lest they run away, wait until the church and Camille, Natasha attacked, the guard knight has no time to return, so they fled directly or died in the chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice had a tear in her mouth when she talked about these things. Someone came knocking at the door. Lucian looked back and saw the old acquaintance Correa and another A church guard who did not know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s just a high-ranking knight who came over, it seems that I have not been suspected." Lucien said in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correa solemnly and politely invited Lucien to the small room and asked about the passage of things, how Lucien told Natasha How to tell him, in addition to stimulating the power of blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being good at taking notes, Correa stood up and thanked him with solemn ceremonies: "The bishop is telling me to thank you, if not your intelligence, the Lord's night The guards will be completely tainted by evil."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church's view, although things are a bit coincidental, this coincidence is beneficial to their own side, if not Lucian’s intelligence, the loss of the night watchman will be even more devastating, and even the whole army will be wiped out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Professor who came to Aalto for more than three months" and Lucien, who has been living here, can't draw the equal sign, this is the church made all The premise of judgment, although Lucien is a witch's neighbor, there may be contact with the professor, but only suspected that there has been contact, with his merits and the status of being appreciated by the princess, it is difficult to grasp and torture, and if there is any contact Obviously observing, not doing the thing that disturbs the road to Sean, but has a better chance of catching the "professor" of viciousness! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After the church’s inquiry, Lucien finally returned to normal life, began a busy music study and magic analysis, and let Ali The Sa family moved to their garden villa for temporary residence. After all, the law and order in Jisu District is far better than the Adejan district. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the magic circle mark in the corner, Lucien never looked at it again, even the final processing of the Magic Lab did not proceed because of fear that the church was tight Monitor nearby and find a professor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day, Victor began to teach Lucien, Lott, and Felice their "cannon" style, which is a basic polyphonic music, more The voices imitate the same melody and appear in sequence, cross each other, chasing each other and entangle each other until the last chord is merged. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This music is beautiful and easy to learn, even beginners can write similar chords, so it is a good attempt to start learning polyphonic music. select. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, Lucien’s symphony of your destiny has unconsciously used the Cannon technique in part, and it seems that you have learned a lot in the music library. "Victor praised Lucian." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lusien is thinking about another thing: "Although the famous D major Canon (John Pachbercanon), in this world It has a similar melody, created by a musician more than 80 years ago, with a similarity of more than 90%, but I can adapt it to Piano by Pachbel's Cannon, which saves time and has Certain innovations to meet the requirements of a concert in a year."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
