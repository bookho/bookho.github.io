			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the gray time stop effect, suddenly there is a silvery light shining, and Rhein’s arms flew out a quaint hourglass with a full moon, half moon, and crescent Wait for the pattern! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the flow of some silvery white sand inside, the time stop effect suddenly disappears, and the sand itself becomes a powder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a rich collection of observers! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, "Douglas" has already displayed an "eternal blaze", and Lucien, who recovered from the slow solidification, has only had time to transform his mental power. The power of the will and the blood is all infused into the "Shield of Truth" to keep it before Himself and the Rhine. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horror reached the extreme high temperature and rapidly vaporized the gray floor tiles, vaporizing the illusory ripples created by the shield of truth, as if the energy storm that destroyed the world would directly Xien Lianren took a shield and blew to fly backwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In just a few seconds, Lucien and Rhein’s strange feelings in different worlds disappeared, and the ripples and debris around them were small. The sacred "Shield of Truth" appears on the surface of the tragic traces of the storm, and it seems that it will be completely damaged in a matter of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien’s “The Robe of the Great Arcanist” sensed the high temperature and energy storms that infiltrated, the “elemental skin” excites, and the “spell absorber” excites , madly swallowed and resisted the damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the Rhine red coat has a faint black light, like the deepest and deepest night, which makes people feel awe and subconsciously admire. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This black light spread out, and the high temperature, energy storm, and neutron storm that leaked in were slightly distorted and transformed, and his figure became blurred, as if The mist of shackles wraps Lu Xien and shuttles into the "dream." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eternal blaze of the eternal blazing blast is unimaginable in the bright light and ultra-high temperature. The shield of truth, Lucien, and Rhine quickly gasify, but like It is a beautiful dream to wake up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Real Dreams"! "Night shuttle"! Two great talents for vampires! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tumbling explosion destroyed the entire hall, tearing the surrounding gray walls and black doors and smashing a drop of bloody yellow liquid from the hall and door. Quickly vaporize. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the explosion subsides, the nearby gray walls seem to have squirming with vitality and repair everything by themselves. It didn’t take long before it was exactly the same as before, but there was no The silvery white magic pattern on the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another gray hall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing in the air that suddenly appeared in the figure of Rhein and Lucien. With a bang, the two couldn’t help but fall down and slammed into pain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't die? Actually resisted a hydrogen bomb!" The pain made Lucien really feel that he was still alive, and there was no surprise in his heart. Use "eternal blaze", but use the most familiar and familiar name, "hydrogen bomb"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough." Rhein's hair was a little messy, but he insisted on picking up a white handkerchief to cover his mouth and coughing violently. It took a while to stop and resume talking. Ability, "The "eternal blaze" you created is really restraining undead. Although there is a shield of truth and a blockage of 'night tribute', I am also very weak, and I can't use too much power in an hour or two. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also because of the super-recovery ability of the blood king, changed other vampires, the skin burns have long been ulcerated, and can not heal for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The tribute of the night?" Lucien glanced at the red coat of Rhine, which still had deep, peaceful darkness, which seemed to be the famous blood. The legendary leather armor, because of inexplicable reasons from the four-level perfect-order legendary items fell to the third-level high-level epic leather armor, if there is no defense brought by it, Rhein and himself may be more seriously hurt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of this, Lucien looked at the shield of truth in his hand, and the black, delicate, and brightly shielded shield was covered with deep scars, and many places. It is a gasified hole that is obviously temporarily unavailable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is a shield of truth, and it has been completely vaporized in exchange for other three-level legendary items." Rheinland is alertly watching the surrounding black gates. According to previous encounters, it may also be a monster's bad taste. It will not It appears in the grey hall out of thin air, but meets the target person as the door opens. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien caressing the uneven surface: "Mainly because its defense principle is different from others, this can survive."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a silent addition in the heart, and we can survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eternal blaze is a range-type attack, spell triggers, etc. may not be able to flash to the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, Lucien took a small and complicated alchemy cabin from the storage bag and threw it in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dark golden hut has grown so fast that it has quickly grown into a magical laboratory with a well-structured, alchemy platform. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Portable Alchemy Platform?" While regaining power, Rhein looked at the magic lab curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded: "This time I came to the world of adventure, I naturally made all kinds of preparations, such as how to deal with equipment damage." Do..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Lucien will not take the long time to find materials to repair magic items, just like the last time he was forced into the alien space. But according to their own equipment, pick up the repair materials. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no time for us to stay, monsters will come over at any time." Rhine is not as weak as it was, at least the bat wings behind it can be unfolded. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and found the necessary materials to repair the shield of truth, thrown into the portable magic laboratory, and then put the shield of the damaged truth On the alchemy platform, the repair steps and requirements were briefly introduced into the lab through the mind line. At the end: "Please, Pittsburgh."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "No problem, lord, it should be repaired after half a day." "Magic Lab" made a light and happy voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine's mouth twitched: "It turned out to be an alchemy life that was specifically assisted in refining."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pittsburgh, my brother of Taling Pinocchio, the alchemy-specific life that I and Mr. Claus jointly developed, if not very serious damage, even the legendary items can be repaired, which can save the magician a lot of time. Especially when it is time to take risks." Lucien introduced Pittsburgh, and when he mentioned Klaus, his heart was quite awkward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein put the handkerchief in his pocket and wondered: "Pittsburgh is the younger brother of Pinocchio, do they have the same surname?"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh." Lu Xien certainly does not say that he is purely a cold humor, just so named. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-small "Magic Lab" into the storage bag, Lucien looked up at the unchanged gray hall and began collecting environmental parameters Calculate the current coordinates to determine his position. At the same time, without the shield of truth, he does not re-emerge as an epic knight, but instead puts the sword of truth away, ready to greet the danger after the magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Lucien’s face changed: “This is very close to the last position left by Mr. Muskilllin. We are so deep into the 'world of the door’. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a sad coincidence, in which I can't control the direction of the night shuttle, I once hoped to go directly to the soul fireplace, the result... ..." Rhein gracefully spread his hands and expressed his apologies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are also listening to the 'voice of mystery'?" Lucien smelled the "voice of mystery" from the rhetoric of Rhein, while saying Check the black door with magic and get ready to push it open. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine finishing his own long silver hair, hehe smiled: "The really interesting show, Lucien, you have to go to Muskilllin The location of the last coordinates?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shared the calculation of the law of coordinate changes from Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
