			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he heard the words of Benedict III, Ketonia silently said: "My Majesty the Pope, I will secretly assist the 'flame of the source', so as to clean up The crime swindled by Thrad, I hope that the Holy See can send people to save the immediate members of my family in the future."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Flame of the Source" is the "night executioner" "The legendary occupation, the southern church likes to call the night watchman code, while the outside world is used to the surname with the occupation name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your confession I have already felt, I believe the Lord will be happy for this. After this time, I will let Baha'u'llah keep the night guards. Your family, when the time comes, I will re-grant you the title of the Duke, and give you the territory near the holy city of Reims." Pope Benedict III said gently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ketonia itself is a legendary third-order powerhouse, but the tree is big, and Lentat has legends such as Hathaway, Davy, and Winston. In turn, the guards are in the vicinity of the Magic Council's base camp, Allinge. It is easier to save people than to be a night watchman. He even suspects that Natasha imprisons his family's immediate members in order to seduce himself to save people. Uncertainty has already placed extremely dangerous traps, which will lead to the siege of many legendary magicians, so there must be other forces to cooperate, and wait until the other party's most vigilant stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ketonia showed a smile: "Your magnanimity is amazing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" You teamed up with the 'night executioner', I can already see the end of Lucien Evans, but he will definitely be protected by the Magic Council. You must be careful. The Lord tells us that the legendary powerhouse is alive and dead. "There is more importance." Benedict III expressed his interest in Ketonia, and then slightly sighed. "This time things don't seem to have a good harvest. You first hide in the North, I let the 'nights' Contact you." He is ready to rush back to the holy city of Lance to issue a ban on the magic radio in a short period of time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, although he has already recognized the ability of radio stations to guide thoughts, but did not think it would be so powerful, this is still a magician who surpasses ordinary people. In terms of the long-term acceptance of such edifications, the people of the popular communicator will increasingly deviate from their beliefs and fall into hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Benedict III also knows that this kind of thing can’t be banned for a long time, especially the decline of the church’s strength and the weakening of the control of the nobility, they will certainly chase this Luxury and elegant enjoyment, therefore, he only wants to control in a short period of time, take this opportunity to establish a "salvation road" for the radio stations belonging to the church, and arrange the array of sensors to monitor electromagnetic waves in major cities. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kotonia’s face was awkward: “Yes, His Majesty the Pope.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The figure disappeared, leaving only a spot of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the light, Ketonia sighed softly. If, before, the epic knights in the nobles had a great deal of autonomy over orders and tasks. This kind of thing that helps the night watcher to clear the eight-ring magician does not need to be done by himself, but now, one step is wrong, step by step is wrong...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"only in this article On the road, I opened up the light of my own..." Ketonia also turned and left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the villa on the outskirts of Aringe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Atomic Research Institute, how can Black not understand the value of neutrons, which means that the atomic internal model of the new alchemy is built on the basic framework? It is established, meaning that the magicians who are good at elements and change the cognitive world will usher in a golden age of leaps and bounds. Just like when Brooke established the classic electromagnetic system, only one hundred years later, the electromagnetic faction The small element of the original "Elemental Family" has developed into one of the four strongest factions within the current Magic Council, and there are signs of fusion of another faction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The discovery of neutrons strengthens the existence of particles, and wait until the legendary magician, high-level arcane masters modify the idea of ​​photon direction, I The spirit and soul will grow rapidly. Even if these have not yet appeared, in the case that the cognitive world is closer to reality, I will not be long before, and I hope to see the third ring." Black smiled and smiled and excited. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lavendi, Gaston and Chloe, Leahy? Carter jointly proposed the theory of random motion of molecules in liquid. After a more complete explanation of the nature of this phenomenon, the question of whether the atom actually exists is truly determined, and is no longer caught by the arcane theorists of energy essence. Some omissions and doubts, this has led to a small increase in the strength of the magical divisions such as Black. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Black, have you heard Mr. Evans' speech?" Ophelia asked with a trembling voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black also couldn’t control the emotional answer: “Listen, it’s a miracle night tonight! Two theoretical systems that change the era can be established!”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be so impulsive, although the theory of relativity is confirmed by phenomena, it only shows that the algorithm is correct, and does not mean that the process of deriving the algorithm is correct. After the review by the gentlemen of the Arcane Review Committee, of course, I personally would like to believe the essence of this gravitational interpretation.” Ophelia tried to calm herself, but she couldn’t help but express her adoration. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the excitement and excitement, Black became straightforward and vocal. He laughed and said: "I doubt if the gentlemen of the Arcane Review Committee can understand this. The paper of general relativity may require the auditors of the Great Arcane Masters to review."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too, I’m totally listening to Mr. Evans’s general explanation. I don't understand...call, I can't wait to wait for the dawn, so I can go to the institute to verify the existence of neutrons with electromagnetic cyclotron..." Ophelia still maintains basic sobriety and reason, this experiment must be verified by hand. Only then, because of her level restrictions, the family has no way to have a relatively high-end magic array and alchemy device such as electromagnetic cyclotron. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black was reminded by her, and looked at the direction of the Allinge Magic Tower with his eyes: "I think I will lose sleep... Wait until the existence of the neutron is Verification, the pillars of the arcane field have become three, the electromagnetic theory of Brooke, Mr. Evans accommodates the theory of relativity of the Speaker of the Lord, and the new alchemy system..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, but we're afraid to call Lord Evans." Ophelia laughed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black also replied with a bit of a voice: "Yes, Lord Evans!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at the top of the magic tower, Lucien, Samantha and others noticed the changes in the sky of Rantart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Elemental disorder, atomic model phantom... Is Lavendi, Donald, or Morris?" Fernando temporarily put down the paper and walked to the window. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Rentat, in the field of elements, only the three Masters are close to the cognitive world semi-cured. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien also got up and stood next to the teacher, smiling: "No matter who you are, it is the success of the parliament."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, Lucien is silently expecting to be Lavendi or Morris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's also your success, the existence of neutrons should be confirmed." Helen's voice is cold and refreshing but not indifferent, as if the winter 曰 is very warm In the case of greet falling snow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She believes that whether it is Lavendi, Donald, or Morris, it will certainly be verified several times before it will eventually accept the existence of neutrons and change Your own cognitive world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the two Arcanists are talking, Samantha and others can only express their congratulations with their eyes. The neutrons found that the establishment of the new alchemy system means With a Holm crown ring, the general theory of relativity can definitely get the Arcane Scepter Award if it is approved, but this is not important, Lucien? Evans will inevitably win the glory title of the Great Arcanist tomorrow! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Congratulations, Lord Evans." Samantha said quietly in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the celestial changes cease, Fernando said to Lucien: "Follow me to Helen's study."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Luisen nodded quietly, walked behind the two Arcanists, and waited for Helen’s study to see Oliver, who was trying to open the blockade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slightly decapitated: "Congratulations, Lucien, the new Arcanist!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Then, his face showed a relaxed smile: "Your gravitational nature explained that this panic ended, and I also sense that the Speaker of the House of Lords is trying to open the half-plane, it seems that he is obviously not voluntary, and the conversation is also There must be other problems, well, there are a few more legendary aids, maybe a day and a half will allow the blockade of the real secret to be lifted."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
