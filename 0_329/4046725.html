			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the last Friday of April 827, the 31st floor of the Allinge Magic Tower was crowded and noisy. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is probably the highest density of official magicians..." Heidi mixed in the crowd and joked about Katrina and Annick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of "Atom Control" Lucien? Evans will hold an open class on the microscopic field this morning, so most of the magicians are boiling and looking for every opportunity to come and listen, which has forced the top of the Holt School of Magic to issue a restriction: The teachers and students of the college can choose whether or not to attend classes here. The outside magicians, whether low-level, medium-level, or high-level, all decide whether they are qualified for the course according to the order of registration. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint frowned at Heidi: "What do you pull us to do? If there is a problem, ask the teacher privately."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi smirked: "I haven’t experienced the teacher standing on the podium for a long time. How can I miss this opportunity?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of her, the Arctic Institute's Arcanists mostly have part-time jobs at Holt School of Magic, giving back to the community the “treatment” they receive under the teacher. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I miss the leisure life that I used to study at the Magic School." Lei Yiya went to the big classroom with Heidi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taling Prospell temporarily opened up the magical array of space folding, so this large classroom is wide enough to sit down thousands of people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick couldn’t think of the problem in this environment, so he defended Heidi’s whimsy: “This opportunity is really hard to come by, usually the teacher is sure We will not sort out the content from the beginning, and systematically speak the whole system. This will help us to grasp the omission. You see, Mr. Gaston, Ms. Isabella, Mr. Larry, Mr. Dieppe, Mr. K, Sa Ms. Mansha, Ms. Rachel... They are all here.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He originally wanted to read the names of the magicians he knew, but It was discovered that this was a very troublesome thing, and it was more troublesome than studying the microscopic field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The right thing, Annick said is the core content I can't express." Heidi did not shyly borrow Annick's rhetoric, and then take Everyone sat in the position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katrina sighed softly: "I don't know what the teacher will say today?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The micro-field has developed to the present, she and Lei Yi Liya and others are also a bit dazzled, and feel that they need to be very desperate to catch up. If it is not the foundation laid by Lucien, let them use and understand in the mathematical direction, I am afraid I haven't been able to keep up with the top microscopic arcane divisions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is an open class for all teachers and students, and Evans certainly won't talk too deeply. It should be an overall surname analysis that is easy for everyone to understand." Ophelia stayed at the Atomic Research Institute for nearly four years. The level of arcane and magical power is soaring. But even so, she is ignorant of the microscopic field, and she urgently needs such a review of the overall surname to help her grasp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint is looking forward to the authenticity: "I don't know if the teacher will have a new theory? Why do microscopic particles have a new theory of uncertain surnames?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It shouldn't... This is the biggest mystery in the micro-domain, perhaps representing the truth of the world." Annick shook his head, "according to the teacher's consistent persistence Viewpoints, probabilistic surnames and uncertain surnames are all intrinsic surnames of microscopic particles. They are not inevitable disturbances caused by measurement. Therefore, if you find out why microscopic particles have such an essential surname, it means true understanding. The microscopic field."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi licked his mouth: "The teacher's explanation is simply deterministic about your life and death. No wonder the stars of Isabella and Ms. Samantha. The Department of the Arcane Master will come to attend an open class."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice of the conversation, the Vice-Chancellor of the Holt School of Magic, the Panel Member of the soup spectrum came in and pushed the gold-rimmed glasses on the bridge of the nose: "Quiet. <br /> <br /> & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; with the aid of amplification of magic, crowded classrooms at large is quiet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, wearing a black double-breasted long dress, Lucien, who was wearing the same color bow tie, walked in from the side door and took the top hat down and placed it on the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The time of everyone is very precious, we go directly to the topic. The research on the microscopic field should start from the wave war of light, so that we can understand other The speciality of the microscopic particles..." Lu Xi'an said calmly, starting from the classic wave experiment of light, slowly speaking that the particle name of the light was confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that the magicians are very familiar with, and it is something that is very deep, so no one can understand it, and soon it is integrated into Lucian’s lecture. Rhythm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......The discovery of cathode ray, the confirmation of electrons, the revealing of the internal structure of atoms, the confirmation of protons, the introduction of new alchemy...from light to all microscopic The wave-particle two-image surname of the particle, many experiments in the microscopic field do not conform to the reality of the previous model, the idea of ​​matrix mechanics, the interpretation of the wave function, and the debates caused by this interpretation and the surname of the wave-particle two elephants, different Arcanists, high-order The views held by the Arcanists, along with Lucy’s martyrdom, are clearly manifested in the minds of the orthodox teachers who attended the class. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not too difficult to calculate and content, let them have an overall reputation for the micro-domain, indulge in this magical field, forget the passage of time . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Evans is really just, telling different interpretations, even analyzing why there are differences, no theory at all is definitely correct, other theories are not The value is arrogant.” Dieppe’s heart nodded and nodded. He was able to achieve so many achievements so young, and Evans’s arcane attitude was absolutely no problem. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, Lucien’s overall surname is outlined, smiling and watching everyone: “This is the first part of the content, here, I want to remind Everyone, although in the previous narrative, I tried to avoid the difficult mathematical knowledge, but we must bear in mind that in the microscopic field, we can rely on only mathematical and experimental results that we can only rely on."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special emphasis on Lucien, Heidi and others at the Institute of Atomic Research are not surprised, because this is the teacher who repeatedly warned himself and others, while others have not accepted Lucien. The educated arcane masters probably understood that they nodded. They knew the important surnames of mathematics, but they did not understand why they were overemphasized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked around in a circle and said with a solemn tone: "The microscopic field is a world that we can't directly see with the naked eye. All our current observations are inevitable. The ground will have an impact on it, and there will be various phenomena of inconspicuousness. In the face of these phenomena, there will be different interpretations. Different theoretical models, under the rough view, seem to make sense."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what I want to say is that in the micro-field, in areas where our past experience cannot be copied, in the field where the method of customary surnames will be biased, all interpretations, all theoretical models, must Strictly based on mathematical theory, other than that, not called interpretation, not called conjecture, but fantasy, fantasy!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mathematics will not deceive us ..." Nesika whispered to himself, and the momentum and this sentence of Lucien left him with a mark that could never be erased. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s serious attitude made most of the arcane masters slightly alert, and they were more impressed with the important surnames in the microscopic field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I believe that everyone has doubts about the wave-granularity of the electronic image, and doubts about the probability cloud that permeates the space and is everywhere. There is doubt as to whether it can ** pass through the two gaps..." Lucien suddenly raised this issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vast majority of arcans nodded frequently, this is by far the most difficult and controversial place, but Annick and other students of Lucien are all big. Eyes, according to their understanding of the teacher, I am afraid it is not that simple! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The teacher is ready to complete the electronic double-slit interference experiment?" After a brief silence, Heidi quickly reminiscent of the teacher's busy project, which will be electronic waves. Important verification of the grain two elephants! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annick and Sprint didn’t have the interest to talk to her, looking at the podium with a gaze, and the heart was waiting for the teacher’s next sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien paused for a long time: "Sit for five minutes, then I will demonstrate the electronic double-slit interference experiment."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
