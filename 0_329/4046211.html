			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For others, there is no difference between this issue and the next issue, as long as it can be published in the journal of the Ordinary Arcane Monthly, which has good influence. In the early part of the month, Corusine submitted a paper on the Periodic Table of the Elements, in order to have enough time to submit the manuscript, so that it was seen by most arcanes in the new issue. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Lucien took a breath and tried to find the opportunity: "Mr. Woods, can you include it in this issue of the Ordinary Arcanist Monthly?" Even if it depends on the position behind?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, Evans. We have already sent notices to other arcans." Woods smiled but refused firmly. The goodwill of Lucien and the little emphasis on his future are not enough to make it cost a little more. After all, Lucien is still a first-class arcian, and has not really shown the amazing and important arcane. Magic ability. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s back was straight and kept a smile: “Mr. Woods, skipping the previous few atomic data I have not been able to correct with experiments, you I will find that the atomic weight of the latter part of the element is as wrong as I judged from the cycle name, and I have completed the latest measurement in two or three ways. The paper is accompanied by my experimental data."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods extended his right hand and turned the paper on the table to the last few pages, then shook his head: "Evans, this can't explain anything, even if you really The measurement is correct, and it can only show that your paper is closer to the truth than to the truth. The data of the atomic weight of the previous elements can definitely be your guess."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; In fact, he still does not feel that there is anything worth paying attention to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe because of something we haven't known yet, it's difficult for these elements to measure their true data using existing methods. Why is it that I am wrong? , and not for other reasons?" Although Lucien wanted to put forward the concept of isotope, but finally resisted, only vaguely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isotopes are elements with the same number of protons and different numbers of neutrons. Their surnames are similar and will be confused if they are not noticed. Lucien can't dare to "guess" in the magical parliament that still has an elementary cognition and stays in the atomic stage. This may be more dangerous than being monitored by a pale hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods smiled silently: "Evans, you are a first-class arcian, and in recent years, the minimum of these atomic weights has been retested by different methods. Level 5 Arcanist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not finish, but the meaning is not clear, normal people will choose to believe who is very clear. This is not the reason that has not yet been known to be able to fool people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Woods, I am giving up the inclusion of the next issue of the General Oralist Monthly, and I insist that my thesis is correct." Lucien quietly Looking at the papers on the desk, I got up after a while, and the black top hat was on the left chest, expressing my gratitude to Woods for her kindness. Woods is not angry. He has seen too many young people who are so reluctant to admit defeat. He stood up and said: "Evans, if you don’t come to the end, you can’t I found the journals included, and I have always opened the door to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If things are done, he will not quit halfway. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien put on his hat, picked up the paper, thank you again: "Thank you, Mr. Woods, let me stubborn again this last few days. Even if I hit it It’s my own willingness to bear the blood.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a road to Lucien, that is, taking the risk of holding a Holm crown ring Going to the Holm Royal Devils Court and elemental will seek help, anyway, has been doubted by the pale hands of their relationship with the professor! Of course, this may cause a qualitative change in the danger. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low a little taller, Lucien’s figure is more straight, with a black top hat, a long trench coat and a strong expression on his face, leaving Woods with I am deeply impressed by a determined young man! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ more than ten days ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 14th floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, an exclusive lounge of the Commission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rogerio looked at the paper in his hand and couldn’t help but smile and shook his head: "Young people are really full of challenging authority, crazy and bold. Fear."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it a bit, Rogerio can't stand it, because one of the Temirik elements is his, and he measured it in different ways, plus several high-ranking Arcanists with the same authority. The evidence of the measurement data, he never doubted that he would be wrong. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's put down the paper, Rogerio knocked on the table, thinking about how to let Lucien himself appear in front of the middle-level magicians of the elemental will, thus promoting things. So that you can observe the change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Before going to Natasha’s “The Holm Royal Bank Allinge Division – the world’s tallest bank” Lucien first returned to the Douglas Magic School, because once he took out the Holm crown ring, he would no longer have a retreat, and he might not be able to come back in a short time, so you need to explain to President Donald, K and other friends and apprentices in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, has your paper been included in the journal?" Just after returning to school, Lucien had not had time to open her mouth, Rock after lunch, Jerome and K came together. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receiving the letter of rejection from the "Elements" and "Alchemy" journals, they already knew that Lucien was delivering the paper and inquired about Lucien. In terms of research content, I saw Lu Xien’s leave today, and I all speculated that he had made a contribution, so he came and asked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien remained calm and smiled and shook his head: "Rejected by the "Organic Arcanist Monthly", and several of the original ones who wanted to deliver were rejected." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Even the "Organic Arcanist Monthly" refused? Do you want to give you the "Arcane Discussion" and "Magic Research Monthly"! Rock didn't expect them to invite Lucien to go seriously, but he refused! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jerome indicated that Roque should not say anything, and then comforted Lucien with a few words. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Lucine was ready to find a reason to explain something for a while, the silent K suddenly said: "Evans, I followed the time ago. Mr. Li met an auditor of the "Elements" journal, Ignatius. He is more kind, and I am taking you to Renttat and asking him to come out for dinner."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the invitation, there is no use, K is not sure. In the final analysis, it is still necessary to look at the quality of Lucian’s thesis. What he can help him is to eliminate the auditor’s low-level by his relationship. Arcane division's discrimination can be seriously and unbiasedly reviewed again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at K with a slight surprise, misunderstanding that his honest and honest people also know how to walk the back door, and then take a deep breath: "Thank you, K, Let's go to Rantat."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is an opportunity, try to grasp! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ After lunch, Woods took a nap and then walked into the magic tower's lab with ease, the next two hours were him. Fixed magic experiment time, no delay due to reviewing papers, practicing magic, etc. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woods opened the Alchemy Array and was ready to continue the magic experiment of yesterday. I don’t know why, he suddenly appeared in the eyes of Lucien’s stubborn and unwavering figure, and then he made a difference. Pick up a bottle of purified elements and start measuring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he insists on this, there may be nothing wrong with the experimental data attached. The atomic quantity of the correction element is also a matter of harvesting a lot of points. It is better to try." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the rules of the Magic Council, the basic data of the atomic weight of the element, the first determined or corrected magician and the next five experimentally determined magicians, will Share the citation points according to the ratio of 3:2:2:1:1:1, and give them after passing the integer, but only limited to one year. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is already rich enough, and it is difficult for any paper involving this element to contribute to Arcane points. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an experienced mid-level magician, Woods did not take too much time to determine the atomic weight of this element:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is consistent with Evans' data that the previous atomic weight has a minor error."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After using two methods Woods confirmed that the corrected atomic weight is correct. It should have been assumed that the original method was a problem. The latest method of measuring from other angles circumvents this premise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
