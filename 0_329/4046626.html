			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bloofley, what do you mean?" Oliver asked in confusion, he was familiar with the languages ​​and cultures of different countries in different regions, and could be on Lucien. The habit of making words is still powerless. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s expression is serious and sincere: “Although the creativity of this school is from the past apprenticeship, it is undoubtedly a brand new Form, not only does not have personal attachment, and still get a salary after graduation into the alchemy workshop, just slightly lower than the ordinary, the contract time is longer, so I created a brand new term for it - Brufre, It is the name of this type of school, which implies the meaning of dreams."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What opinions do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Atlant has been closing his eyes, hehe smiled: "I agree with the idea of ​​promoting a general education school and such professional schools, but there is a problem. In the past apprenticeship, just teach an apprentice This apprentice will work for the alchemy workshop for ten years without paying for accommodation and food. Now, Bruce and Buffrey require both the alchemy workshop to invest in the funds and the salary of the graduate apprentice. Don't think they will accept it willingly unless Will put pressure on the kingdom."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Mr. Atlante, the times have changed, the past one-on-one or one-to-one apprenticeships can no longer adapt The development needs of the current alchemy workshop need not be said. I believe you should understand that the apprenticeship of the parliament has been transformed into a school system."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "I will lobby several companies that I have shares, and let them invest in Quintiles to build the first Brooklyn. After two or three years, they will reduce costs and expand the market with the support of a steady stream of professional workers. At the time, other alchemy workshops are still in the dilemma of manpower shortage, and the training funds invested by the company in the early stage are recovered from the profits they create. This is a necessary cost."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien does not force anyone to look like, it is not easy for others to save money. Fortunately, he is not a young man who has just emerged in the past when he talked about environmental protection. Force, no support from the forces, they have become The decision of the Supreme Council grasp panel members, with their own power and wealth, can throw off someone else's block, the first sample to make people follow. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the actual cost is not too much, the school venue can let Natasha make a redundant monastery to make do-it, and take out some of the arcane points to issue tasks. Let the magician and the graduated apprentice go to teach, and those with excellent teaching results can enter the Atomic Research Institute or follow their own learning for a period of time. This way, it is not unattractive, and from the second year, the school will be arranged. The apprentices went to the alchemy workshop “internship” in their spare time to recover some of the investment in advance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the attitude of Lucien, Atlante and other confused magicians are relieved, he nodded slightly: "Really, the times are different." The old things should be buried in the past. I suggest that the top review team make a resolution on 'Bloofley' to encourage the alchemy workshop to invest funds but not force it. Evans, if you want to build it, you can count I have a copy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas patted the palm of his hand twice: "I agree that the Allinge Telephone and Telegraph Company affiliated to the Parliament will take the lead in investing as an example. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it is not forced, a member of the highest-ranking panel has raised their hands and agreed that the atmosphere is very harmonious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still a question. Can you let the general school become popular only by the financial support of the parliament and Holm countries? Will you find it after the apprenticeship? Going to things? You know that the current apprenticeship is almost enough to meet the needs of the alchemy workshop, and they are not pre-made as an apprentice like 'Bloofley' for an alchemy workshop if they spend A lot of money can't get a change in life. Maybe it will resent the kingdom and us, and the heart of the god of truth, completely contrary to our original intentions." Atlant is the master of trying to figure out people's hearts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "Mr. Atlante, the change of the times is a chain reaction. When there are so many alchemists, there is social wealth. The increase, with all kinds of alchemy items that are close to the city distance, the structure of the whole society will inevitably change the nature of the surname. Perhaps a job will divide a lot of finer and more professional work, and there may be things that were unimaginable in the past. Of course, the scale of the initial general education will certainly be controlled, not blindly promoted, and suitable for our own financial and social conditions."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I have no opinion. Evans, you are sober, not in a hurry." Atlante has no research on the changes in social development, but his old partner transformation master Erica is an outstanding historian, very much in favor of Lucian social division of labor. A more detailed statement, after talking to Atlante silently, let him give up the original skepticism. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will add two more sentences." Lucien found that he has more and more leadership styles. "I propose to enact regulations that regulate the alchemy workshops, and impose restrictions on overtime and child labor. You can't let the alchemy workshops." Too much crushing workers, there is a scene of hell on earth, which will allow more people to go to church. It is best to work within ten hours of daily work, child labor can be used, but labor must be distributed according to age..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the simplification and promotion of the two aspects, the current alchemy workshop is in a state of strong nowhere, the dwarf artisans and human workers can maintain a good health, so Lucy En thinks that it should be the first to standardize, to squeeze the workers in the alchemy workshop to benefit, and to form a vested interest group to curb this inevitable trend, so it will be much simpler. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the use of child labor, Lucien can only helplessly compromise, there is no good relief system at present, many orphans can find a job to survive is the most important We must not blindly pursue the ideals regardless of the actual situation, but it will harm others, too much. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This small problem I think is not suitable for discussion at the highest panel meeting." "Absolute defense" Atumman stopped Lucien from going on, "norm The alchemy workshop, the kindness of the workers is in line with the goal of the parliament to establish a new image of the magician, but we only need to make a general direction, the specific details are handed over to the committee for improvement, and we will pass the final review."<br /><br /> Oliver also interjected: "Evans, you are also a member of the highest jury. You can tell the committee to draft a regulation according to your ideas, and then show it to everyone, but the premise is not If you are wrong, you can basically pass it. You don't have to discuss specific articles with us now. Everyone's time is very valuable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien gently daggers, indicating I am still adapting to the change of identity. I am not a specific performer, but a reviewer, a decision maker, and a supervisor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I heard Oliver say this, Lucien once again recalled the matter of lobbying for pollution treatment. In order for the Panel to pass similar regulations, he was running around. Lobbying a big man, and finally having to stand in the conference room of the committee to express their opinions, accept the inquiry, and even the process of discussing and deciding them can not participate, can only passively wait for the results, and now, Oliver understates himself to order The Commission has drawn up regulations and it seems that this is a small matter that is taken for granted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is the feeling of standing on the top of all magicians..." Lucian said with a feeling in his heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the highest commentary group, the Archer of the Aringe, who is the rotation of Aringe, serves as the president of the Panel, changing for five years, and the vice president is permanent. Oliver, Atuman, and Sun Manuel, who are strong in power, good at fighting or dealing with things, are led separately in external operations or in exploring different spaces. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the norms of the alchemy workshop did not involve the loss of current interests, the other top members of the jury did not object, the issue continued to deepen, and the discussion began on the four countries of the Straits and North. The control of the coastal corridors, the construction of the three major fortresses along the Stormwind Strait, and the number of airships. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Lucien knows that there are not enough situations, quietly listening, no comments, after all, even the seemingly cumbersome airship Different from what I originally thought, although it is a bit slow, it uses a lot of materials to build a magical array or a magical array. It is called an air fortress. The general blow will not cause harm at all, and it has the advantage that the plane is hard to match. It can't be solved by ordinary bombardment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for large passenger aircraft, it is not necessary for high-level magicians. It is better to promote magic steam trains below the higher order, so that more places are connected by railroads. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconsciously, the meeting came to an end, Lucian once again said: "You, the highest honor in the current major magic fields belongs to various organizations and countries, no Parliament, this is not in line with common sense. Since the most glorious title of Arcane and Magic is the Arcanist awarded by the Parliament, the highest honor should also be the award given by the Parliament, and the development of Arcane is getting faster and faster, more and more achievements. Today, our standards should be stricter, not only must we have enough results to remain in the annals, but also have their own theoretical explanations."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the Parliament is willing to set up I am willing to take out one-third of my shareholdings each year to encourage the development of arcane and magic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After becoming a legendary magician, the material Preciousness often requires bartering, so the annuity income is actually not so important for Lucien. It is better to make up for the impact of the headshot demons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
