			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time seems to solidify in the hall of the magician management department, until other magicians come in to break this strange atmosphere, let Eric return to God, refused Just in front of the reception desk, he quickly flipped through the contents of this paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he remembers correctly, Lucien? Evans? X is the young man he knows who has been in contact with Arcane for three months! Can he write such a highly rated paper? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the level of the first-class Arcanist, a ring magician is compared with the reward of three hundred arcane points and two thousand arcane points. Such glare is extremely impactful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the page turning of the "Elements" journal, Cindy and Donna are also waking up, so hard to see why their friend Lucien Can get such a high rating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the front of the periodic table shows that Eric is shaking, and the heartbeat is fierce and the blood flow is accelerated by the law of the period full of mystery. In reviewing and appraising, he naturally believes that the content of the paper is correct – it is not just a description of the surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I can read and correct the atomic quantity error, Eric, Cindy, and Donna are full of doubts, some elements are old, and The anastomosis was measured in several ways so that the later superstitious masters of the arcans did not use the new method to make the measurements. They did have errors, but some important elements would be used by the arcane masters in the past few years. They used the experiment, how could the data go wrong? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Gaston and Mr. Avery are almost the same. Can they not make the same mistake at the same time?" Faced with such confusion The thing, the lively Cindy, seems to be quiet and confused. "If you think about the previous cycle name, think it has a discussion of the surname, and the reward points are at most one or two."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working at the Magic Council headquarters for nearly two years, Cindy has seen the results of many papers and can barely guess the standard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dona followed and nodded: "The review of the elementary journal of "Elements" is not possible for the Arcanist to publish it without experimental verification, and still The first one!”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric took up the doubts and continued to turn it down, and soon saw the experimental report attached by Lucien, the atomic quantity correction data inside. Shocked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is still no evidence to determine the surname..." The voice just fell, and Eric’s eyes widened again because he saw the title of the next paper: "according to the discovery of a new element of the periodic table and determination", author: Woods, four arcanist, Ring magician. - The papers that Laven thinks are equally important, and the order is best ranked by the time of publication. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While looking at the paper, Eric turned his hand to the front with a slight trembling, directly comparing the contents of the Lucian paper, fearing references in Woods's papers. it's wrong. Looking at it, he was as drunk and his face was red and his forehead was violent, which was a magical prophecy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Lavin’s discovery of new elements and the determination of atomic weight by Lazarus and other arcaneists, the indisputable facts completely shattered all unrecognized ideas. It has steadily opened a new door to the field of elemental magic, and has also raised doubts about the reasons for the errors in the atomic weight data of the previous elements. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The paper turned back to the periodic table of elements, and Eric looked at the arrangement of the apparent change of the surname of the period, and could not speak for a long time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cindy’s magic apprentices are much more shocked than the official arcane masters. They still can’t understand the great significance of this periodic table, just by that Precise "prophecy" and neat cycle changes are scared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The cycle of the element's cycle name looks really magical, and like the Brooke equation has the ultimate simplicity of symmetry deep and mysterious beauty." Cindy could not help but put it It is comparable to the Brooke equation with the title of "God's Poetry". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dona also praised: "It seems that there is God, oh, there is something we can't understand, and it's all about it. Otherwise, how can the element be presented in such a cycle?" Changes in the law of surnames?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church forces in the Kingdom of Holm have been suppressed by the Magic Council, but they still have a lot of influence among ordinary people, like Donna. Cindy, a girl from the general public and the farmer's family, was more or less influenced by the beliefs of the surrounding people before being selected to enter the magic school. Only after they saw the magical magic, the faith has long been weak, not so much as to believe in God, but to seek spiritual comfort and tranquility. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most high-level arcans never thought about getting enough Arcane points advanced from the audit committee's assessment awards. The main source of their points is quoted, which causes their arcane level to be generally lower than the magic. Level, only the authority can be equal to the level of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, the level of the arcane level like Mr. Evans is far higher than the level of magic. The parliament created the arcane level for three hundred years. Eight people, nearly half of them are the current Arcane Master and the legendary magician." Cindy is eager to recall the legendary story he has heard. Some of her did not dare to call Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a low level, because a paper is valued, the arcane level is occasionally higher than the magic level, but it is much higher than that of an abnormal person. When they arrived, there were two great arcans, a legendary magician, one sick and the other, and two died in battle. The two later lost their brilliance and became like other arcans. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric light gray eyes turn, once again looked at the spread of the paper: "Four Arcans, I can't think of Evans to Aringe only two For many months, the arcane level has surpassed me." It took him 30 years to become a third-level arcian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he closed the "Elements" journal, revealing a suspected smile: "This time Evans is famous throughout the Magic Council. Even if you don't add X as a difference, mention To Lucien Evans will also directly think of him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............ "Arcane" journal headquarters, editor Drummond face gloomy Throwing the "Elements" journal in his hand on the desk, this level of the paper is not published in his own period, which is simply insulting the reputation of the most authoritative and influential journals in the magic world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drummond is a high-level Arcanist with a level of Arcane level 7 and is the authority of the force field, the magic of the star system, if not the choice As the editor-in-chief of the "Arcane" journal, he is absolutely qualified to enter the Arcane Review Committee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time his anger burned the soul, although mainly because the two members of the Arcane Review Committee made mistakes during the first review, they failed to The author's draft of this paper is not the fault of his own journal, but when they met with Gaston and Avery, who had re-evaluated the matter yesterday, they even laughed at themselves and said that the author of the paper personally came to the journal of "Arcane". Was smashed out! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drewmond’s black eyes chilledly look around the auditors. The words spit out one by one: “Who did the audit? If not, Why not submit it to me and don't submit it to a special Arcanist?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the most authoritative journal, "Arcane" and most of the high-level Olympics The master has a good relationship. If you can't judge whether it has enough value to be published in the "Arcane" journal, in addition to the reference evaluation results, it will be submitted to the corresponding field of high-level arcane masters, even the legendary magician, the great arcian Do a third review to minimize the loss of valuable papers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping by the icy eyes of Drummond, the auditors are a bit embarrassed, but not too scared, several times a year because of the review Mistakes and loss of valuable papers occur, at most, a few words are thrown, deducting rewards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not my review." One of the auditors was the first to answer, and the rest of the arcans also said, "I have not reviewed it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drewmund pulled his lips and smiled at them coldly: "Who did it review?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reception desk outside the "Arcane" journal, Gavin looked at the "Elements" journal in front of him, his face was pale and ugly as undead, and his eyes had no focal length. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi next to him shook his head with some sympathy: "Why didn't you let him directly follow the process to the corresponding mailbox, let the Baili responsible for assigning the paper I gave it to the auditors, and as I just told him the reason."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do you not understand, in the "Arcane" journal This kind of place filled with middle-level arcans, we must strictly follow the prescribed authority, absolutely must not exceed. The things outside the scope of work, the more we do, the more wrong, do not make mistakes without doing anything." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gavin stunned and looked up at Heidi, who has a public name. She usually seems to have a big brain. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The Rantat Aristocratic District stands a magnificent magical tower filled with the style of the Tria Palace, which reads "The Holm Royal Devils Court" "The golden word." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
