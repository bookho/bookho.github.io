			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October in October is like a fruit on the cake, sweet but slightly cold, and the surrounding area is dyed with a golden color. Together with the Lava trees floating in the city, they woven together a poetic picture, and with the melodious music that can be heard faintly, everything looks so peaceful and beautiful, worthy of the title of "the capital of music" . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only the Melzer Black Forest is always dominated by black..." On the banks of the Belém River, Natasha looks at the Black Forest on the other side. It is said with emotion that the long purple hair is blown by the autumn wind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Black Forest has left her memories of many hardships, pains and gains, whether it’s the intense knight training of a girl’s period or the encounters in it, It is an unforgettable experience in her life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Black fir, a tree unique to the black mountains, suspected of being smothered by a certain alien space..." A pair of scholars' tone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha couldn’t help but be laughed at by his correct answer: "Why does it mean that black is not meaningful to me all the year round, What makes sense is that I used to be chased by the Kobolds. I ran into the tree fruit so much that I couldn’t stand the pain. The poisoned numbness fell on the ground and couldn’t move. The abdominal injury could only be escaped by someone. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She understands that Lucien’s answer is to deliberately distract his attention and return himself to the "Knight" from the "musician", so that he can happily carry out "Al. Take a day trip." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have been chased by the Kobolds? I feel that with your fighting talent, even if you don't stimulate your blood, you can still crush the Kobold." Lucien asked with interest, in his mind, Natasha was a "female goddess" from an early age. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha’s mouth screamed: “I can easily get the ten or so kobolds. The problem is that there are hundreds of kobolds and one at that time. You can only cast spells!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What the hell are you doing, let the tribal Kobolds fight you together?" Lucien laughed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha snorted and raised his right arm: "I can’t remember!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You don't always say that you remember very well..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone will have a mistake, in short, can't remember!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two slowly walked on the banks of the clear Belé River, enjoying the familiar river wind, recalling the past with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Natasha stopped and pointed to the remote bank of rubbish in front of her, smirking and looking at Lucien: "Is this what you are harvesting?" Where is the first bucket of gold in life?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, thank you, Princess Royal Highness, for losing a veil of nightingale, so that I succeeded in taking the lead from the poor. One step." Looking at the garbage dump, Lucien was still quite touched in the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few ragged poor people who are striving for stinking and looking for valuable things. There is a big waisted man on the embankment next to him. They supervised them with both hands, even the golden moon. He only wore a thin brown coat. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha sighed slightly: "This is still controlled by the gangs.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" After the Aaron gang, Aalto seems to have a new gang. Lucien was not surprised, only emotion, in the actual situation of Aalto, the birth of a new gang is only a matter of time.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gangster beater noticed the river On the road, there is a man and a woman who are looking at themselves and the poor people who are looking for rubbish. They originally wanted to warn them not to take care of their own business, but they found that they were dressed like aristocrats, so they did not dare to be reckless, turned their heads and pretended to appreciate the river. Quietly watching the other party's actions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien and Natasha did nothing, continue to bathe in the river wind and go to the gates of the market area This makes the gangsters feel a long sigh of relief.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiar and noisy market area, the slang of Alto accent, and the clothing style that is quite different from Lentart, is the most intuitive shock to Lucien and Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The market area has not changed at all, as if we have never left the same..." Natasha often goes outside the city from this gate. The manor is often wearing a veil to find interesting things, so it is no stranger to the market area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded and took a deep breath, mixed with barbecue, spice, dye, smoke, wine and various The familiar smell of odor made him seem to have returned to the original, in the market area tough to discuss life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I used to carry goods here, when I was not strong enough, a pack of goods could hold me down." Pointing at some small shops on the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smiles and listens, follows him in the market area, pointing to a shop from time to time:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"This grocery store has a history of 50 years. When I first came, my grandfather was still entertaining guests. Now it looks like a grandson..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...···The boss recognized me when I bought the ancient lyre, almost fainted..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien is also full of memories of the market area: "...On this street, John and I will beat the Aaron gangster's thugs..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; That is the beginning of my initial recognition and true integration of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pedestrian looked at the two men and women who walked in the market area, and pointed out from time to time, it was inevitable that it was strange, but Lucien and How could Natasha care about their gaze? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking along, the two crossed the market area and entered the administrative district, the pedestrians began to decrease, the streets gradually became quiet, only one street musician The bard is playing different music to create a sea of ​​music, and there is a feeling of sublimation of the soul in the walk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha listened carefully, and then laughed for a while: "G major string serenade ······"Moonlight"... The second movement of the Kingdom... "Sorrow" ······ Dedication, "Dedicated to Silvia"... I can't think of you leaving Aalto for so long, your music is still played regularly. The more tracks a street artist and a bard play, the more popular it is. The classic music is classic whenever it is...···”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "There are also your marches..." The Lava trees on both sides are covered with golden leaves. Lucien listens with his heart and distinguishes different tunes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha smugly sang a melody, then sighed slightly! Once compared to before, the frequency of your tracks has been greatly reduced. They are all the latest outstanding music. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two are concerned about Aalto's musical development and are no strangers to the outstanding ones.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is a good thing, things are constantly evolving, always sticking to the past. A little improvement or not, can only show that Aalto's music has died. Fortunately, what we have heard is not the case." "Lu Xien doesn't mind the authenticity.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha didn't answer for the time being, but took Lucien to stop outside the restaurant and listen to the door. Street musicians play "Sorrow" on the piano, which is recognized as a very difficult work. And he plays very freely, so the Aalto people who know the music stop to listen.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His early repression, depression, pain, and tragic atmosphere created very well, so when the last movement pops up with a dazzling, high-pitched note with dazzling movements, it can bring up the surrounding audience. Emotions.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪啪啪, after the end of the piano performance, there was a warm applause around.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young pianist seemed to be unpredictable about his popularity, and sat behind the piano for a long time without responding.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good, not a pale performance, with emotional resonance." Natasha gently applauded. Then she took out a coin and prepared to throw it to the street performer like other listeners. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, her movement was stopped by Lucien, and she laughed: "Would you like to give him 'Queen Gold Coin,?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the expulsion of the Southern Church, the Kingdom of Holm is also re-casting coins, which is different from the common currency. The Queen's gold coin is equivalent to the Jintale, but the Queen's head is engraved on it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha said with a smile: "Hah, didn't notice. Do you have Jintal?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his head, took the Queen's gold coin, rubbed it with his thumb, and then the Queen's gold coin became Jintal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young performer came back and thanked the audience for the hospitality. Suddenly, he saw a golden coin falling in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jintal?" He suddenly stopped, too big? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentle voice rang in his ear: "Playing very well, integrating your feelings and understanding into the music, let this piece of music bring It’s very rare to have a distinct personal style, but there are still some problems with your playing and understanding of music.······”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Question?" The performer has not yet returned to God, and then heard Lucian's words of explanation and analysis, each of which is in his heart, because most of this is a place that he has always felt awkward for a long time. Part of it is that I feel very satisfied, but I can only find the wrong experience after listening to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a while, he really woke up and found that the gentleman who guided himself and his wife had gone a long way, leaving only two side by side The back of the line. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to catch up and thank, but the restaurant owner is still staring at himself, can only sing: "Thank you!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a noble gentleman, no, it must be a musician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not look back, raised his hand and signaled that he had received it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You really like being a teacher." Natasha smiled and looked at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "I don't like being a teacher, but a kind of gratitude. If I didn't meet Victor's teacher, I didn't get his exception teaching. I certainly won't have any later achievements. Therefore, when I meet people who need guidance, I will give some guidance. Maybe their life will be worse. Oh, I am returning to society."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Returning to the World······· Natasha thought of the joke of “revenge society”, with a smile like a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So listening to the walk, the two quickly came to the Alto Musicians Association and saw the unique "Bounce Flame" building, which was light But the complex asymmetrical beauty is famous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It still looks like this, it hasn't changed..." Lucien and Natasha sent a similar sigh at the same time, but Natasha soon Shaking his head and looking around: "I don't know if it's good or bad. The place I passed before shows that in the few years I left Aalto, it has hardly changed, like it has solidified in time. And Lentat, maybe this morning is the same, and in the afternoon it is just another 'face.'<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rentart, in a period of great development, Rantat, which has carried out numerous infrastructure projects, has been undergoing earth-shaking changes throughout the city, as Lucian expected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Without mentioning the lives of ordinary people, such Aalto may be more suitable for the current musical style..." Lucien said without guilt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Also, Rantart’s current appearance always feels inconsistent with the current symphony style, and it should be another music..." Tasha nodded seriously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Different cultures, different eras, will certainly give birth to different music..." Lu Xien said sincerely, my heart is belly Maybe one day Lentart will develop rock music...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
