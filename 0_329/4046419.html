			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blue is innocent, the sea is wide, and at first glance, it makes people feel open-minded. Lucien slowly reduces the flying height and gives himself a "high stealth." "The surgery", the Taoist fisherman's altar is near the bottom of the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you fly down, the stronger the smell in the sea breeze, even with a bit of stench, Lucien’s “healthy belt” stress Hair, flow invisible power, and exclude the feeling of pollution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushing on the blue sky, silently igniting a lot of dead gray, dark, dark green bubbles, they swell to a certain extent and then rupture themselves, will Surrounded by the same color, full of evil and chaotic taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pollutioned seas, similar to the dark mountains, are cracked throughout the space, but smaller, more singular, only connected to the endless abyss. Long years of chaos and evil Pollution, the creatures in this sea area have undergone demonic changes, which is quite dangerous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information about polluted waters quickly emerged in Lucien’s mind, it has Far from the Sorar Islands and the Pearl Islands, it is really the depth of the endless ocean. Even though Lucien used the high-level flight of the ordinary passenger plane to fly, it took several days to arrive here. Of course, the road Sean was looking for a rest on the island at night to avoid excessive fatigue and break the sun scepter by the way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the distance from the land, there are no precious minerals and specialties nearby, and the Magic Council has not paid attention to this sea area until Lucien passes through the stormy strait At that time, when the fishermen robbed the sea bream, they learned about the existence of the polluted sea area and harvested the map to go here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, Lucien’s magic level was only a ring, there was no plan to venture, and the intelligence was submitted to the Magic Council for an Arcane Point reward. I forgot this matter, and when I accepted the mission of Rheinland, I used the right of the members of the Arcane Audit Committee to read the relevant information and found that the Commission had completed a preliminary investigation into the incidents of polluted seas and fishermen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the information on the 'polluted seas' was not taken seriously, it only gave me an arcane point, but the last benefit was myself. Well, the committee The efficiency is really good, the benefits of the organization are not only the material resources, magic knowledge and security..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien feels back about Information on the sacred fishermen's altar in the polluted waters:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... 寇 鱼 , 智慧 智慧 智慧 智慧 智慧 智慧 智慧 智慧 智慧 智慧 智慧 智慧 安 安 安 安 安 安 安 拥有 拥有 拥有 拥有 拥有 拥有 拥有The talent of the sea, the strong ability of the sea under the melee, widely existed in the stormy straits and endless oceans, has been developed from the primitive tribe into a national form, with the altar as the core of the gathering... the royal family is generally located in the ocean 5,000 kilometers northeast of the Soral Islands Heart Festival..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."The God of the Seas" Ambola rumors have fallen asleep in ancient times, never responding to prayers, until recently For thousands of years, the authority of the priests has been basically taken by the royal family, only for The symbol of faith and honor, in this regard, the priests of the squadrons are very dissatisfied, can not be effective, can not make effective resistance ..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "...In early May 816, a sacred fisherman's altar in a polluted sea, suddenly secretly claimed to have the god of the ocean god Ambola, asking the fishermen to collect a large amount of materials to open the altar. The hidden ruins, awaken Ambola, and restore the majesty of theocracy... In view of the involvement of the 'God,' the event is submitted to the highest review..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... In January 817, the fishermen in the polluted waters collected resources and began to open the relics. The royal master, Brooke, and the silver moon scholar Chelsea Holt, were close to the 'bystander'... When the relics were opened, the prince of the fisherman led Many powerful rushers arrived and seized control of the remains, and they presided over the waking ceremony..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The ceremonies failed, failed to wake up Ambola, Lord Brooke, etc. People have not found the 'corpse' of Ambola, but the remains The opening also brought about the resistance of the sea god altar to the pollution of the sea, so that the strong priests still retain a little hope that the awakening has been successful, but many years of sleep have caused the god of the sea to fail to restore all power, so If it does not come, as long as the long-term sacrifice continues, one day, the god of the sea will restore the ancient glory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because of the interference of the squid There are only two high-priest priests in the polluted seas, two seven-level marine warriors, a 'blue escort' group of about 100 people, and thousands of devout fishermen in the entire sea. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another advantage is that the fishermen of the shoal are very large, and the creatures that are polluted by the endless abyss are quite dangerous. Every day they go out to prey and need high-ranking powers. In many cases, there is only one high-order left in the altar. Keeping the guard, this is the right thing for Lucien, as long as he seizes the opportunity, he can sway and take it away with ease. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Wayne was worried that with the opening of the ruins and the failure of the waking ceremony, the arrangement of the Rhine would be invalid, but Rhein said that there was no problem, but it would enhance him. The magical array, but he finally frowned slightly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Safety is the priority, when you put the bloody ball into the altar, you must hold the 'pale justice' After all, it is connected with the endless abyss. When you start the magical array, you may be amazed by some crazy evil guys. Although they can't directly reach the main world, they can still be 'contaminated' through partial strength. After that, there is a good defense effect, but since you have taken the pale justice, you must choose the most powerful one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both positive and negative In terms of certainty, Lucien also came up with the idea of ​​choosing to directly sneak into the opportunity after observation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waves were almost photographed on Lucien’s body, and the smell of blood and stench was strong. A flounder suddenly jumped out and bite at Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This flounder is different from normal, the whole body is dark, the two rows of teeth are sharp, and there are four pairs of baby-like arms on the body, with a blue glow, as if a nightmare The monster inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the creatures of the devil, you can see the invisible by nature! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien returned from his thoughts and turned his eyes to it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil's flounder has been broken down into countless light spots of different colors, returning to the pure elemental appearance, and quickly blending with the surrounding. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In early May 816, I got the god of Ambola, that is not the case that Maskillin's big cross-frame has not collapsed for a long time. Is it really related to the world of the dead..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convergence in doubt, Lucien blessed himself with "water breathing", "underwater action" and other magic And some spells that cover up the breath and traces, gently put into the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea is crowded in all directions, swaying, dreamy and fascinating, and Lusien swiftly heads for a sea cave in accordance with the instructions of the information and maps People are not deep-sea creatures. They live in places such as reefs, rock walls, and seaweed gathering places that are dozens of meters below the sea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grotesque fish swims from Lucien with a sinister feeling, and from time to time they can see their chaos, half an hour later, Lucien saw the caves guarded by the monsters of two fish heads. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three days later, Lucy confirmed the law of the fisherman's activity Well, I stunned a fisherman who was preying on the ground, and changed into the appearance of it. He dragged a seven-day demon sea snake, and entered the altar cave where the invisible and high invisibility were ineffective. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;啪, just turned the corner, Lucien threw the sea snake into an empty nest, slightly changing the appearance of the "fish man", carrying "Frost long sword", turned into a residual image, hiding and hiding, "carefully and concealed" to the direction of the altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The god of the ocean, Ambola's altar is decorated with a large number of sea stones, crystal clear, unusual dreams, and under the altar, there is a whole body fat The gray fisherman wrapped in it, its scales have lost their luster, showing a pale pale. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, above the altar, the tall and majestic fisherman’s statue lit up with a light blue glow, reflecting the “strange fish man” that quickly came close . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there a stranger who sneaked in? Isn't the royal family still dying, still thinking about the secrets of the god of the sea?" The fisherman priest Blanchett took a strong Resentful and secret. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the sneak fishermen are on the verge of the altar, Blanchett has ordered more than a dozen "dark blue guards" around:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When he enters this cave, he will catch him with the magic array. I will carefully question what the royal family wants to do!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;</div>
