			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha stopped in front of Felice and smiled humorously: "Don't welcome me? I was originally a guest at Silvia, I happened to know She is going to come to your rite of worship, so when I think that the old count is still alive, I often go to the villa and the 'Bern' manor. Oh, Felice, you were so short, young and desperate to follow me. Alfred's brother, Uncle Samuel and Harrington go hunting, but they always fall, can't catch up, can only wow, cry, a decade has passed, you are already so tall, grow up (sincere - Ren). Alfred's brother and Uncle Samuel will be very pleased to see this scene in the Kingdom of Heaven."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfred is a tile The eldest son of Olympus, Natasha’s brother, also became the genius of the five-level knight in his twenties. Samuel is the current brother of Hein and the brother of Urban, who once became the most famous and well-known. Returned to the successor of the title, they all died in a battle with the heresy of the heresy nearly ten years ago. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only intend to come together to make a lively, satisfying curiosity, Natasha, after seeing Felice, it is the youthful past that reminds me of the memory, thinking After ten years of hard work, I finally became a real warrior from a little girl, and my loved ones continued to be called by the Lord. I also gradually drifted away from my former partners, and I couldn’t help but feel a little sad and instigated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairy was in a huge disappointment, frustration, sadness and anger, but forced to hold the smile to welcome the guests, shocked at the arrival of Natasha, When I heard her warm words with emotions, I couldn’t control myself, and my tears came out: "Of course, you are welcome, you are very welcome, Natasha sister, no, Princess Royal Highness."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She subconsciously shouted the name of a child. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha gave Felice a hug: "It doesn't matter, just call me Natasha's sister. When I was young, I was always filled with the best memories of my life. Happy, Felice, congratulations on becoming a real lady.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere is warm and faintly sentimental, making people calm, and Lucien Understand why even if the Earl of Hain is so disgusted, Urban can still be a clerk in the Aalto City Hall, there are still many small aristocrats, and Felice can still be the most like the Earl of Yvette. The beloved daughter became a good friend. Alfred and Natasha should have a good relationship with Samuel, Urban, Harrington and Felice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha let go of Felice and watched her tears of excitement, joy and sentiment, and smiled slightly: "Well, Felice does not cry." Today is your rite of passage. Tears are not suitable for decorating your beautiful faces. Be happy, be happy, understand? I will preside over your adulthood." As a great knight, she knows Haien with a glimpse of her eyes. The count did not come, but also understand the reasons. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I will be happy to hold a banquet party." Felice tried to control her tears, crying and laughing, and having a future woman. Dagong, now the Earl of Violet, presided over the rite of rite for himself, is that the Earl of Hein can compare? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha saw her look and tried to ease the atmosphere with humorous words: "I didn't bring a gift, I don't mind, Felice." ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How come, you can come is the best oyster gift." Felice once again embraced Natasha, she arrived in time, The warm embrace and soft comfort are so beautiful, full of the feeling of a big sister or brother. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha and other films were released by themselves, only to point to the road inside the road: "But my music consultant will definitely bring you good The joyful music makes you forget the troubles and immerse yourself in the happiness of the adulthood."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She whispered in her heart: "Bastard, just because you are curious The serenade, I will come over, and I will fall into such an emotion and almost cry. How can a great, strong knight shed tears, so I will give you pressure..."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the last "Silver Point", the strangeness between Natasha and Lucien has disappeared a lot, plus Natasha’s humorous, direct, and loved person’s surname, and Lucien was not afraid of the "normal" response of the market, and the two became more and more friends. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasa mentioned in public, all eyes are condensed on Lucien, because many of the musicians themselves are nobles or nobles. Sponsored, so most people already know that Lucien will play a new serenade to congratulate Felice's oysters, so he talks softly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Welcome to you, Your Royal Highness, Ms. Camille, Ms. Silvia." Uber's face seemed to bloom with a flower, and he indicated that Feili would not be excited, and he greeted Natasha. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hall, Silvia came directly to the circle where musicians gathered, and Natasha reluctantly greeted the nobles, regardless of their Whether the title is high or low, regardless of their strength or weakness, as long as they have the status of aristocrats, as their lord, the most basic etiquette is still necessary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silvia goes over here, the more the face is faint, the whole person is more shy and beautiful, she is the first time with Natasha The way to attend the banquet, in the face of many acquaintances is inevitably this reaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher, good evening, you are really early." Silvia said hello to Christopher, she is the "living music legend" Disciple. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher gently sighs, no demanding anything, the music industry is more acceptable in this regard, he only said with a simple concern: "Sylvia, think about the future, well, you don't want to adapt the piano? There are several 'authorities' of the piano. You can talk more."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;His "authority" refers to Victor, Rhein and Lucien, who appreciate the piano with a new fingering, while Silvia was previously limited to the fine harpsichord instruments that are only suitable for indoor use. It can only be played in the piano room or the salon, so even if a lot of elegant and quiet music is created, there has never been a concert in the Hall of the Holy Ghost. The appearance of the piano has made her see the hope and intends to change some of the music. Get fit for the piano and prepare for the future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter Natasha told Lucien, so at this time Lucien had no doubts, and seriously and very seriously communicated with Silvia to adapt the piano. The problem of the song and the fingering of the piano made her ease the feeling of shame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julian and other musicians from the court of Tria were forgotten by Lucien. They wanted to interject several times, but they knew very little about the piano. I can't join the exchange, others are not enthusiastic about them, and they are not treated as musical genius, because here is Aalto, because they are not famous in Aalto. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This attitude made Julian three feel the arrogance of the outsiders in the Aalto music industry and felt insulted. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKantz looked at their expression changes and smiled with satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Because Natasha came to host Felice’s rite of passage, many nobles rushed over after being notified, let’s make the original eight The banquet started at half past eight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hay Earl is sinking, since he is sick, it will be loaded to the end, anyway, for his big aristocracy, as long as it is not blasphemy, treason and rebellion, etc. The crime, that is, the sin of the sin, can also lead a luxurious and noble life in his territory, at most, away from the political stage of the Principality and deprived of the control of the non-direct Knights, but Harrington is because of a well-known reason I came to the banquet. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rite of passage is not complicated, Natasha took a flaming flower from Felice’s mother and put it with the coat of arms of the Haien family. Wear it on Felice's left chest and then give a short message. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next. She reached out and invited Felice, and the opening dance of the banquet was the last of the rites. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the festive and happy melody, the two beautiful women danced, Natasha is a five-level knight, regardless of strength, agility or coordination, far more than Fei Li Silk, took her out of the best dance in life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the opening dance, Felice gasps aside, Natasha is waiting for it, because according to the process, the following will be Lucien The serenade style piano pieces are gone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all people’s curiosity and expectation, Felice’s mother walked over the hall to announce the show. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time, Julian followed, and he smiled with a polite and apologetic smile: "His Royal Highness Princess, respected lady, beautiful Philip Miss Silk, and ladies and gentlemen, I am very sorry to come here. I am Julian from the court of Tria. Today, without the invitation of Miss Felice, I followed Mr. Griffith. It’s too risky and too rude to come to her oyster banquet, so I want to send a serenade I created, expressing my sorry and congratulations.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
