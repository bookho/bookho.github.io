			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s cognitive world is still changing dramatically, the most obvious being that the edges of the space begin to bend, not square, but Like an elliptical sphere, it seems like a layer of distorted space barrier. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, whether it is the two main stars of destiny, or other illusory stars, their gravitational pull causes the light near themselves to begin to bend. The surrounding space is faintly transparent, and it is also shrinking rapidly. At first glance, it will definitely create an illusion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hole-like fate of the main star is more and more horrible. When it rotates to the front, the whole cognitive world's wind, fire, water, elements, electronics and other symbols They all flowed uncontrollably to it, and the chaos reached the extreme. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feather pen in Lucien’s hand keeps on, according to the previous discussion and the gravitational field equation, several prophecies and evidences are given:<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"From the perspective of the space curvature caused by the solar mass, the excess precession of the morning star near the point can be calculated, which is basically consistent with the observation..."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting from the time-expansion effect caused by the gravitational field, and subtracting the slower time caused by the speed of the artificial planet, you can get the artificial planet faster than the ground... This is the actual production The adjustment values ​​match..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The light will deflect in the gravitational field, and the angle of deflection is near the sun..."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gravitational redshift of the spectral line..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After writing these, the thick papers are painted with a full stop. Part of it was the direct revision of the drafts accumulated by Lucien in previous years. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien half-closed eyes, sensing the changes in the cognitive world stars, they are gradually integrated with those special and complex symbols, it seems to construct Two very complicated and very magical spell models, based on these two spell models, all the magic symbols and modules around are twisted into a mysterious pattern, as if you have a glance, the soul and spirit will I was completely sucked in and became very tired and confused. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This feeling, Lucien once had it, that is the first time I saw the book of Stars and Elements, I saw the "Elemental Dominator" and The "prophet" two legendary occupations have a splitting headache. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The new legendary profession..." Lucien not only did not have joy, but frowned. Cognitive world semi-cure once completed, will definitely do it later Although the scope of the changes is not a big problem, it is very difficult to rebuild the foundation. Maybe it involves the process of fragmentation and solidification, and my own plan has always been based on quantum mechanics rather than general relativity! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the legendary magicians can't have the troubles of Lucien before they are promoted. At their level, the composition of the cognitive world is about the same as the future. It has been finalized, semi-curing is the last and most difficult step, and if Lucien does not have the strength of the eight rings, semi-cured may fail due to lack of mental strength. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, after semi-curing, there is still a problem for the Archmage, that is, the need for a legendary career that matches the world of his own cognition, the more The easier it is to promote, and the construction of the basic legendary magic is also a step that requires a lot of mental and mathematical foundations. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, every big arcian who created the theory of changing the age is more likely to be advanced than the average Master, and is less hindered - their legend Occupation is directly generated in the cognitive world by “real world feedback”, and the matching degree is close to 100%. Similarly, the basic legendary magic has also been formed, until the semi-cured cognitive world merges with the soul and opens up the semi-planet. It can be automatically engraved in the soul, but it requires a lot of mental power to assist. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien thought about it, slammed up, walked to the electromagnetic cyclotron, and placed a piece of metal material that had been prepared for a long time in a magical array. In the middle, and a piece of paraffin board is placed behind the material board. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Lucien knows that the semi-curing of the world has not yet been completed, turning on the cyclotron and bombarding the metal plate with helium nuclei. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the magic array detection device captured the proton trajectory behind the paraffin board and recorded its range and various data. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the data came out, Lucien did not take the quill, nor did he use the auxiliary calculation matrix, and started the mental arithmetic directly with the powerful soul, the conservation of momentum and the conservation of energy. The ray that the proton hits gradually reveals its true colors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass is approximately equal to the proton and cannot be captured in the electromagnetic field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the neutron that the magicians have been searching for since the publication of the New Alchemy! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to be directly discovered due to the electrical surname, not affected by electric and magnetic fields, more dependent on similar indirect methods! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real sound of the sound in the road to the west side of the road, the semi-cure is close to the end of the cognitive world, and the violent reaction again, the atomic nucleus finally Showing his true appearance, protons and neutrons are tightly combined under some undiscovered power. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unspeakable, transcendental world’s vast starry sky is “falling” in Lucian’s induction, interacting with the cognitive world, forming a A complex and difficult three-dimensional symbol, the "atomic fission" and "atomic fusion" spell models that are not lacking are quickly completed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sky Radio Station". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha and others looked out of the window with a little surprise, and it was the act of the Archmage to semi-cure the cognitive world based on gravity at this time. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illusory black horror that seems to be able to swallow everything slowly dissipates, the wind converges slowly, the rainstorm gets smaller and smaller, and the change of the sky tends to stop. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know which one you know the world is semi-cured? You must interview him tomorrow!" Samantha said with a smile, although she had previously recognized The world has not wavered, but confidence has been hit hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a semi-cure cognitive master of the world, as long as the legendary occupation matches more than 50 percent, relying on years of accumulation and legendary magic The analysis, at least 60% of the possibility of promotion to the legend, so she changed the name to call you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another arcuist is delighted and relaxed: "And it seems that this gravitational theory is closer to the essence than the speaker, anyway, I have never been at any The magic record has seen the last horrible black that devours everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha just wanted to answer him, a loud bang from the outside, and deafening, The whole Aringe was trembled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When looking out the window, Samantha saw the night become like an abyss, countless electromagnetic waves directly in the sky in the form of visible light, a curse that is difficult to describe It has a green shape, and in their center there is a tumbling fireball that radiates a horrible energy storm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fireball vacated and slowly turned into a mushroom cloud rising, but compared with the "Eternal Blazing" mushroom cloud that Samantha saw that day, the head appeared A lot smaller, black gas and flames entangle each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this?" The arcanes present were amazed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The louder explosion than before was suddenly emanating, and Samantha felt squeaky in his ears and could no longer hear other voices. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the explosion, a round of the sun rises from the outside, dispelling the darkness and curse, incandescent and dazzling! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is..." Black rushed from the sofa to the window. If he remembered correctly, it was the day he was locked through the lock of Allinge. The "eternal blaze" scene! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only difference is that it was a real image at the time, now it is a virtual scene! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the tall towers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The astrologer who is talking to Lavindi’s mouth, Annois’s mouth is slightly open, it’s hard to close, and it’s completely unimaginable to look at the scene in front of him. How did the gravitational-based cognitive world semi-curing process become based on “new alchemy”? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a phenomenon that has never happened before in "History of Magic"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annonis, how does Alinge have two loud noises?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Seems to see that the sun rises in Aringe, is there a mushroom cloud?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, hello! Annonis?"<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven's voice kept ringing, but Annonis looked out and forgot to answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 33rd floor of the Allinge Magic Tower, Fernando saw a mushroom cloud with a strong curse, and his eyes rounded up: "It is Lucien." This kid!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said where he went!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only yourself Douglas, Hathaway, and Lucien know the legendary magic. Even the other Masters are semi-cure cognitive worlds by "new alchemy". Because they are not the founders of the system, there is no real world feedback, and this legend cannot be built. The model of magic, so even if there is a similar change in the sky, it will not be so clear and complete! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lusien? Evans?" Helen looked at Fernando with a slight surprise. "He has such a deep research on gravity? And how does the cognitive world cure?" There will be two stages?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando "Gently cut teeth": "How do I know! He must have hidden a lot of papers!"<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allinge’s distant sky, Ketonia looked at the familiar “eternal blazing yang” mushroom cloud, very puzzled: “There are several masters who are semi-cured in the cognitive world. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pope Benedict III shook his head and was surprised and puzzled: "I thought this was the harvest of Fernando and Hathaway when they were promoted to the peak of the legend. It seems It seems that there are others..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary magician’s promotion to the peak is a process of fully integrating the cognitive world with the soul, marking the semi-cure to the limit, so it will Causes the change of the sky, and the scope is greater, but this can hide in its own plane or other differences The space is complete, do not let the enemy know. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cognitive world, the starry sky of destiny is semi-cured by the influence of gravity The wind and fire water is also semi-cured under the initial changes brought about by the internal structure of the elements. There is a violent conflict between the two, which makes Lu Xi's cognitive world shake! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, the discovery of neutrons is a little worse." Lucien pressed his own disordered soul and gritted his teeth again to open the electromagnetic cyclotron. But this time, the metal plate and the paraffin board placed in the magic array were taken out and replaced with a crystal clear single crystal. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cyclotron, the electrons are stepped up by the energy, and the "whistling" is launched. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! Bang! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien once again had the illusion of bombarding a shell, and it was more violent than just now, it seems that a magnificent palace is in such a madness. The explosion suddenly collapsed! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, Lucien’s mood suddenly became tense, as if the simplest and deepest mystery was about to be revealed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronics bombarded on a single crystal and showed a beautiful and dreamy pattern through the alchemy device, it is so shocking and unbelievable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this scene, Lucien closed his eyes and his face was full of exclamation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a classic diffraction image. The electrons as the elementary particles in this case exhibit a diffraction image that only the wave has! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
