			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest Hertos opened his mouth and gave an angry griffin while pointing the golden scepter in his hand to the "Sacred Gate". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pale stone texture above a golden line quickly highlights, forming a strange beetle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the "Sacred Gate" burst into a light, like a small sun, stabbing the high priest's eyes with tears, black eyes, short-sightedness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this dazzling light, the gates of the saints slowly open backwards, the rolling black gas is suppressed, and the "waves" quickly subsides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The movement of the gates of the saints makes Lucien, who is preparing to vaporize the form, alert, is it that the priests found the wrongness in the palace? Or is it simply because of the oppression of Prince Dgula? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the reason, Lucien has no doubt that the priests can see through the resident illusion that they left behind, and their existence is no longer a secret! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting a nine-level scroll jump? Lucien was carrying a pale justice, and still holding the trigger scroll from teacher Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the brain made a quick decision, Lucien’s gaze subconsciously swam inside the palace, and suddenly saw the golden dragonfly of the Sphinx Oh, I suddenly felt a move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems unnecessary to waste this precious scroll? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door of the Holy One slowly opened, and the dazzling light came in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took a nine-level reel’s left hand and pulled out another thing from the storage bag. It was engraved with a cross and surrounded by sun rays. It is the amulet left by Maskillin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Finks has regained its sleep, it seems that it is no longer so dangerous to hide into the gaps of the dead world! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm and soft as if the "spirit" of the warm sun shines throughout the road to Sean, the coldness of the Finks Palace is rolling like a snake. The rich atmosphere of the dead spirit came from the direction of "Golden Dragonfly". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light black gap erected above the raft, just like a sword hanging from the top of Finks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took the pale justice, the shackles and the jump reels, dragging the heavy steps and rushing past the gaps two or three steps. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of the saints are completely open, the black air is completely calm, and the god priest, Hertos, holding the golden scepter, walks in, and the spirit completes the entire hall. Shrouded, but nothing is empty! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The damn sorcerer!" The horror of the Hortos lion screamed, causing the mausoleum to tremble slightly, leaving the Sphinx in the camp outside to squat again. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no one, but he does feel the breath of strangers, so subconsciously think that the sneak has escaped, this is so angry. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the golden scepter, Hertos made a strange roar, one eye became dazzling like the sun, and the other was as if it was a silver moon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this strange eyes, scenes begin to emerge, and there is a picture of a hooded mysterious man walking through the black air, and he lifts up The long sword, the vague scene of the golden scorpion, has a strange event that he finally flew forward and the space began to distort. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine-ring spells, retrospective vision! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is difficult to get rich details in the case of interference from many external forces, the picture is blurred and very simple, but it does not prevent Hertos from recognizing the ancestors of the ancestors. The damn man, and the main purpose of his coming in. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to stop the great king Finks from resurrecting! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Lord Hertos, what about the torn sneak?" The high priest took the courage to ask. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high priest was terrified and terrified: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The power of the 'Great King' is such a bug that he can imagine?" Hertos straight Looking at the golden cockroach, "I can still feel the 'King of the Great' watching us and feeling the power of his vastness."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hertos lifted the scepter and began to predict the recourse with the rest of the atmosphere and the palace arrangement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the flashing sun, the golden scepter of Hertos suddenly dimmed, and he was terrified: "Is he not in this world? No, faint The covenant can feel it, but it is so vague that it can hardly capture the trajectory!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world in his mouth refers to the main material world plus all known differences space. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............After jumping over the thick curtain of the gap in the Necromancer, Lucien felt the familiarity without the slightest anger, and the splendid world was only left. Under the black and white gray of death. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a mausoleum palace without other colors, the general shape is the same as the outside world, as if it were the home of Finks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray "golden" is tied with a reddish-brown line like a spider silk that extends to every node of the palace. Above. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reddish-brown is very dim, but compared to the pale black ash around it, it is so vivid that Lucien can’t ignore it at all, but in the gray There was also a bloody rust-colored ball of light floating on it, which beat like a heart, and the color was equally clear, giving Lucien a very strange feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close your eyes, Lucien found that his mental power field did not even have this ball of light! When the eyes look at it, it is so erratic, as if it does not exist here, can not be touched, can not be found, can not really approach! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still a lot of things that keep changing in this ball of light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is this light ball? Those lines seem to be drawing the power of Finks?" Lucien curiously and stunned, trying very hard Resist the urge to study here, who knows if the priests will find the cracks in the dead spirits, who knows if the shackles will attract the attention of the high-level souls, who knows if there will be high-level undead Come to the inspection, you must leave immediately! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to stop the recovery of Finks and destroy the layout of the Rhine, Lucien gave up the idea of ​​collecting a reddish-brown line and gave up The idea of ​​using magic to stimulate the rust-colored light ball, letting the pale justice, lifting the magic of increasing power, superimposed a layer of defense on itself, pushing the door of the gray saint. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is definitely no ** level undead here, because the priests and the top priests can build their own mausoleum! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the gate, there are also two sphinxes, but they are full of bandaged gray "underworld guards." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have four long legs, silent screams, and coldly attacking Lucian. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien calmly touched the shackles of the shackles that had been worn on the chest, and a sacred aura of light immediately spread out like a wave. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this invisible warmth, the two "underworld guards" are stiff in place, and then as if they have been washed by tens of thousands of years, they have become countless decaying dust. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six-level magic, not dead! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s feet slammed toward the solidified mausoleum, and the week’s undead dying halo. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Induction of the change near the gates of the Holy One, sensing the light that is incompatible with the breath of the self, the boiled within the mausoleum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the solidified picture of black and white ash, a squad with a squad guards trembles toward Lucien with a dense black beetle that covers the walls and aisles. Come. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two distinct "waves" slammed together, the mausoleum swayed slightly, and then the invisible light passed through the solidified black and gray waves . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the spacious passage that was purified, Lucien quickly passed through a gray corridor and was on the verge of exit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a tall, underworld guard with twinkling eyes, holding a giant sword, with a halo of death, rushed from the corner to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not evade, and in his hands and swords, he was smashed by the layers of defense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A huge sacred pillar of light falls inexplicably, and the underworld guards who dragged out the shadows are completely wrapped in it. A little black rises and evaporates quickly. The light column disappeared, leaving only a deep pothole in the original place. The bottom and the surrounding area are all traces of gasification. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight-level magic, Yang Yan burst! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catch the opportunity, Lucien ran out of the mausoleum and saw the everlasting gray sky and the messy desert around the dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The hidden array and the reddish-brown lines seem to be drawing the power of Finks, and Mr. Rhein’s arrangement is also like stealing this power for himself. Use."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who was originally arranged?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a quick sweep, With the knowledge of the magical array, Lucian probably judged a possibility, "But what is the rust-colored ball of light?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know Why, this light ball always lingers in the mind of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t delay, picking the bloodline of one of the most common undead creatures in the dead world, Lucien inspired the deformed mask and began looking for another exit for the dead. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The Gusta Empire, the Marienburg Province, the castle of the Viscount of Noor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Noor closed the door, opened the defensive trap, and then walked into the secret room of his study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the secret room, a beautiful female surname with different ages is dressed in a variety of costumes, lying there quietly, ruddy, like a sleep. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Viscount Nur looked at them fiercely, like admiring a piece of art, then extending his right hand and stroking a 13-year-old girl The face, I feel the cold slack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will never understand that only the body is the most beautiful existence, and the smart female surname will always betray, will be frustrated, will be unreasonable, only The body is perfect! The cold touch and the loose muscles are the art that they can't imagine for a lifetime.” Viscount Nuer's eyes snorted hotly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was transformed into a bloody family by a vampire count, and gradually had a disgusting hobby - a corpse, or a dead body that could not be thought of, could not move So, he was strongly despised by other vampires and had to rely on his inherited identity to hide in human society and enjoy his life. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he noticed a wave of unreachable fluctuations, and then he was horrified to find himself stiff, only to see the doorway through the opposite mirror A mysterious man in a black robe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You...what...do...what?" The stiff throat can only be a word. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nur is very scared, knowing that he is fixed by the three rings of the dead body, and the effect is so good, it must be a high-level magician! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien disgustedly said: "It was just to borrow some blood and let you sleep for a while, but now it seems that you can only say..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let your head be used."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the gap, the roadside Looking for the vampires who lived in isolation or mixed in human society with the help of Rhein, because Prince De Gula chased the whereabouts of Rhein and became the best choice for other vampires to return to the Black Plateau. Who can doubt that one has identity? The vampire with an acquaintance is Rheinland, especially he just left! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An invisible light drowned Nuer and a corpse behind him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............the sacred Heilz Empire, the most magnificent city in the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing in the corner, looking at the ancient wall built in ancient times to guard against the invasion of giants, the direct member of the gorse family, Borak? Fan? Anjou’s eyes were dark and his face was low, as if he had a heavy heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Borak, let's go." I don't know when I came over with an inconspicuous thin black man. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolak returned to God, glanced at him and nodded slightly: "Giz, I hope this will be rewarded."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Master Borak doesn't have to worry, the old duke can live for a long time." Giz smiled at the big "customer" who was depressed and anxious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the oldest giants of the sacred Heerz Empire, the Gorse family is still a strong aristocratic class with two golden knights, controlling one Belong to his own "Ginkah Knights". And because of the former first heir, the old duke's only child died young, and Borak with good bloodlines became a strong contender for the heir, but unfortunately he was unable to stimulate the blood, and was succeeded by another heir, the third-level Knight Alten. Occupy the absolute upper hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the arrogant appearance of Alten’s high-spirited arrogance, the aristocratic girl and the young woman who are lingering in bed between themselves and the aristocratic children around them. After Alten broke into the big knight and he could not find his direction, he changed his attitude and became cold and perfunctory. Borak couldn't help but hold his fist tightly and felt guilty and humiliating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must break through to the Cavaliers, I must be the Duke of the Gorse, I must let those who abandoned me and despise me regret it! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the serious flaws in the family's internal pharmacy, after a long struggle, Borak finally chose to go to the Black Market in Antilles to find magical magical items. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Gisz’s leadership, the two quickly entered a seemingly ordinary villa with a wide basement, which is the largest underground in Antwerp. black market. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Picking up one thing and shaking his head down, Borak is getting more and more disappointed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he saw a white-haired old man coming face to face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Young people, I saw your destiny from the crystal ball, want to know?" The old man in black robes, who looked very mysterious, smiled slightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolak pupil shrinks sharply, looking at the crystal ball in the hands of the old man, the magician can appear in the black market brightly? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't believe that fate is destined, everything is the gift of the Lord." Borak will be convinced that this kind of magician directly found, there must be! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black robe old man doesn't mind: "It doesn't matter, fate is always changeable. If you are truly desperate, don't forget to come to me for divination."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, the black robe old man left. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolak shook his head and continued to search, this is his ninth time to the black market - some paranoid he thinks nine is the best number, once After this time, the possibility of finding magical magic aids will become smaller and smaller. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually, he was disappointed and his heart slowly sank. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there no hope to defeat Alten? Borak was frustrated as if the whole person had faded in color, leaving only the back of black and white. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master Borak, when the astrologer was not saying that you were desperate, could you find him divination?" Giz certainly hopes that his big client will become gold. The Duke of Sparrows. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolak has been silent for a long time, and finally made up his mind to go to the position where the black robe is sitting: "Please help me to divination."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
