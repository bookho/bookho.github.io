			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...an unimaginable ghost..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to previous notes, These two lines of dark gray text are extremely heavy and very scribbled, as if they are full of surprises from the words. .<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What monster can scare a legendary magician like this? And since there is time, why don't he leave? They should have mastered it here. The law of coordinate changes..." Lucien's expression did not change at all, but his heart was analyzing various anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic notebook can be used for many years without any rot in the case of unattended storage. It can open up a unique secret room in the gray hall as a laboratory. Lucien is sure that the writer is a legendary magician, and such a character will not be scared into this way even if he encounters a kind of god. At most, he is desperate and sorrowful, and he is not afraid to be afraid, like a A child who was scared by ghosts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of ghost is this? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vagueness, Lucien felt that the secrets caused by this message made him familiar, and he could read through the memory, but there was no experience of getting the number. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhein holding a puppet arm seems to be adoring the jewels: "This way of making a substitute puppet is unique. As far as I know, only McLaugh Dezhi understands that this should be his relic."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added a tone to the "relics." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"McLeader, the king of alchemy in the ancient magical empire, the third-order legendary magician?" Lucian repeated it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Vicken and Ador, MacLeod is one of the legendary magicians who explored the world of the dead, such as Maskillin. They finally came to the "missing" here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why Lucien used the notation, not the exact number, because Viken did not record every member, Ador also only knows the more famous The rest can only be guessed by inference, and the legendary magicians of the "missing" of the ancient magical empire are obviously not all due to the exploration of the dead world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "From the information I understand, it is probably him." Rheinland's fingers rubbed the light green puppet arms painted with quirky patterns. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and said: "You are an observer, and your judgment is more accurate than mine."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Rheinhehe laughed, as if playing the piano, let the finger tap on the puppet: "This substitute puppet is a rare surname, and it looks like it is not damaged, but MacLeod Deliberately disassembled it and divided it into several parts. If you find them, you should be able to reassemble them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deliberately disassembled? Perhaps after recombination, You can also get important information left by MacLeod." Lucien is thoughtful, this is a way to avoid prophecy in the star system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know how many doors, how many gray halls, we don't know the specific coordinates of MacLeod's different parts of the puppet, it costs thousands of dollars. It may not be found in the year." Rhein smiled and handed the puppet over. "I don't have much use for it. You can take it for reference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien I was interested in the special refining method of the "replacement puppet" in the magic notebook, and this is something that can't be used because of the incompleteness, so I did not politely reach out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The right hand five fingers are placed on the puppet, a little hard, but the silk does not move, the right hand of the rhinestone arm holding the puppet is very tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked up at the questioningly in confusion, not to say to himself? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rhine looked at Lucien’s stunned expression, his mouth curled up, humorously said: “Do you want to take it without saying a word?”<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While talking, Lucien saw his silvery bright eyes become awkward, like a cold night of the dreamy silver moon, so that everyone's soul could not help but fall into it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien suddenly got tired and wanted to sleep quietly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vampire's talent charm! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did Mr. Rhein suddenly start? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unreal broken sound of the mind barrier sounded in the soul of Lucien, making him a little awake, but the eyes are like the night sky with silver moonlight, let people I can't move my attention. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint "short-range teleport" glows, and the "spell trigger" automatically works when the soul is attacked. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, Rhein held the puppet's right hand and gently bounced, and the faint black ripples spread along the puppet to Lucien's hand, swaying the magic. Offset, let Lucien not escape by teleport. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Spell Sequence" and "Spell Sequencer" have effects in succession, but they are all offset by the strange means of Rhein. His red mouth is open and the two are pointed. The pointed teeth stick out and the gentleman bites Luthian:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It’s rude to say thank you."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucien’s eyes became clear, the moonlight bloomed, and the Rhine’s teeth suddenly bite into the illusory ripples, which made his expression slightly solidified, and at the same time, he felt the puppets light. Lucien’s right hand has been released. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s faint coolness is constantly being uploaded from the left hand, the Ring of Congas, which has a strong ability to weaken illusions. Effects such as spell triggers have earned time for Lucien! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not Mr. Rhein!" Lucien held the shield of truth in his left hand and pulled out the silver-gray sword in his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this, Lucien even worried that the Rhine would attack himself for other reasons, and he never suspected that he was a fake, whether it was breath or blood. The source of the sensor, the magic check effect, no doubt that he is the observer of the silver eye count, but just after the Rhine used the odd means to counter the magic trigger, spell sequencing and other magic, Lucien noticed a trace of anomalies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rhine" violently retracted his hand, jumping at an extremely fast speed, flashing the attack of the sword of Lucien Truth, hehe smiled: "The same memory The appearance is the same, the blood is the same, the body is the same, why am I not Rhein? Isn't this a meaningful thing for a smart creature?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are the unimaginable Ghost, devil." Lucien's shield of truth, in front of it, blocked the sudden "flash" attack of the "Rhine", his five fingers open, the manicured nails are more icy than the metal sword, slamming On the shield. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;吱嘎, the teeth are sour and squirming, Lu Xien’s sword is pulled out, and the silver-gray sword light slams the wall of the chamber. There was a gap. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rhine" seems to have no reaction, but Jianguang and his body are only phantom broken, then he flashes from the sky, the eagle jumps, the fingers are sharp, behind The bat wings spread out, obscuring the dome. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"His speed is no worse than the projection of the Lord of Hell, the vampire is really a race known for agility and speed, but the attacking power seems to be insufficient, only the legend The second-order look is simply not enough to break the shield of truth.” Lucien calmly analyzed the situation. After the speed of the “Rhine” began, he was in all directions, and the field of willingness to transform Lucien’s spiritual field could not be discerned. True and false can only be resisted by the shield of truth, and cannot be countered with the sword of truth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dangdang, there was a silver-gray sword on the ashes of the wall, making a crisp and pleasing sound, creating a deep crack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at these cracks, Lucien suddenly had a chance to move: "The Chamber is not big enough, but it is very strong..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hell Ball!" Lucien slammed the mantra, and a sun-bright ball of light flew out from the "Robe of the Great Arcanist" and hit the "Rhein", unsurprisingly He escaped and ran into the wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rumble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound wave swept the entire chamber like a substance, the green acid made the air start to corrode, and the silver lightning turned the room into a thunderstorm forest, burning The flames burned everything, surrounded by real hell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
