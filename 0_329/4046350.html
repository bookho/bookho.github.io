			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magician Management. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric looked at Lucien across the desk, and the old-fashioned face showed a helpless smile: "Evans, are you submitting papers again?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His last paper was only about a month away from today, and caused discussions among five great arcans, and there was no small storm in the Magic Council. And now there is another paper submitted? This speed is terrible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be aware that, except for the essays that lie to one or two points, most arcists can’t guarantee the rhythm of a high-level paper in a month. The cycle of surgery and magic research can be in years, and every paper completed by Lucien is more or less sensational. It is definitely not the kind of arcane master who satisfies the number of papers and neglects the quality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Mr. Eric, who took on the previous paper, I completed the explanation of the formula in the meaning of 'Arcane.'" En pushed the paper in his hand to Eric, folded his hands and folded his arms, and his smile was dull. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric’s eyes became amazed: “Evans, did you complete the explanation of the formula? The five Arcanists could not accurately analyze from all angles. That formula?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." Lucien answered with conciseness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric opened his mouth and said after several attempts: "This time, the discussion about your formula is everywhere in the parliament headquarters, as long as a few When the Arcane Master meets, the topic will be concentrated on it, and the letters from my other field's magician friends are also full of relevant content. But no arcane master has found the direction."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone is in the middle of confusion, why this formula is so suitable for the data of blackbody radiation, but there is no actual arcane meaning, we are not ignoring anything, or still hiding something The laws that were discovered, perhaps as the Arcanists speculated, needed to abandon the conventional ideas and make assumptions about subversion, and then they could find a way. I don’t think Evans spent a month, it’s not sounding. The completion of the analysis of the formula is one of the most outstanding geniuses of this generation of arcane masters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After seeing this issue of "Arcane", he Also try to explore the meaning behind the formula, but unfortunately no clue Then have a general impression after turn our attention to the top of arcane magic and analytical research itself, at most, the face of other arcanist discussed as a hot topic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also the attitude of most arcane masters on this matter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is actually an arcane division who has found a direction, such as my classmate Chloe, but I will explain it earlier than him." Lucien laughs. Corrected one sentence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s because we know the different arcane divisions, Eric replied silently in his heart, and then the curious look of the old-fashioned serious face: "Evans, are you making subversive assumptions as the Arcanists speculated?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of course, a very subversive assumption, but It is also limited to the assumptions above, without any experimentation and magic confirmation." Lucien deliberately emphasized. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric did not ask too much. It is the taboo of the Magic Council to inquire about the specific content of the other paper before the audit results come out, although Lucine is standing behind the storm, He does not mind or worry about this kind of thing, but at least it is a polite question. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Subversion of surname hypothesis? Unconfirmed hypothesis?" Eric repeated doubtfully several times, leaving a deep impression, and then the road Sean’s paper was placed in a small cage and the bell rang. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The Magic Tower study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magic candle in front of Chloe has burned out, and the clear light of the morning shines through the window, dispelling the darkness of the room. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was not affected, like a stone carving quietly looking at the paper on the desk, the brow wrinkled very deep, why according to Evans, the formula is still Can't solve it? What do you think is bad about something important? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doubts are difficult to get rid of, so Chloe combines with the content of Lucien to re-introduction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jingle jingle bells sounded one after another, and the complex magic array illuminates the milky white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the light subsides, a document appears in the center of the magic circle, and the arms grow abruptly on both sides, picking them up one by one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of metal texture is cold and mechanically:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Death? Turn Tina Ms. Dimos, Mr. Hagard.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......“Elements? Mr. Avery, Ms. Locklini.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......"Hot?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When assigned to this paper, the mechanical sound has a noticeable pause. Then read the name of the paper: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;""The distribution of energy in the blackbody spectrum?""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp After a few seconds of pause, the sound of metal texture continued to sound: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Transfer to Mr. Chloe, Ms. Sonya."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the paper was copied into three copies, one was retained, and the two were put into the corresponding different magical arrays, and were again submerged by the milky white light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............in the study. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the content of Lucien’s story as a reference, Chloe’s deduction was very rapid, and within a few hours, the whole formula’s face gradually appeared in him. In front of the eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you want to make the formula, you must make a hypothesis." Chloe's thin face can not help but reveal the fear, the forehead drops The sweat of the beans came out. "This, contrary to the energy equipartition theorem!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy equipartition theorem is another outstanding result of Chloe. It is to perfect the theory of the great Arcanist Brooke. From the perspective of his newly established thermodynamic molecular motion theory, the concept of probability and entropy can be introduced into the formula, but the hypothesis of the continuous surname of the energy equipartition theorem is obtained. It’s just a slap in the face! It seems that the body is divided into two halves, one side is an angel, and the other is a devil! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ear creaked, and Chloe felt confused in front of his eyes and shook his head: "Impossible, impossible! There must be another explanation!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his initial substantive meditation environment, the innumerable black spots that are chaotic and disorderly are like boiling water, and they become more and more chaotic. More and more disordered. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, there must be something wrong, you can definitely get an explanation from somewhere else!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; Chloe screamed in his heart, frantically suggesting himself, and finally calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment, the sound of knocking on the window came and awakened Chloe. He hurriedly turned his head and looked at it, saw a gas servant indistinguishable from the surrounding air, holding several papers floating outside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opened the protective magic array, the gas servant flew in: "Master, this is an unreviewed paper handed over to the office, I brought it to you, you see Who is it to review?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Chloe is in Aringe, there is no mention of focusing on arcane or analytical magic, so gas servants do not Dare to distribute papers to the disciples of Chloe, the auditors of the "Hot" and "Ice and Snow" journals. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chloe wiped his forehead and sweat, and his voice was slightly weak: "Show me first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the paper, he saw a topic that he had thought for several days: "The distribution of energy in the blackbody spectrum." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first paper is this? ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chloe's breathing suddenly became rushed, nervous and trembled to open the bag, extract the paper, and unexpectedly saw the familiar name at the beginning of the paper: Road Sean? Evans? X. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the formula is to be established, it must be assumed that the emission and absorption of energy are discontinuous, but one copy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hypothesis that I just dared to think about in my heart suddenly looked up and quickly enlarged, filling the entire pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... It must be assumed that the emission and absorption of energy is discontinuous, but one copy."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...It must be assumed that the emission and absorption of energy are discontinuous..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This line of words is like the curse of the devil, how The lingering, Chloe's eyes are sluggish, shaking his head and whispering: "It must be assumed that energy is discontinuous, discontinuous..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cognitive world, The black dots slammed into the air, quickly reaching the chaos of the chaos, the disorderly extreme, the whole world became chaotic! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pang, when the meditation environment is completely chaotic, Chloe’s head suddenly blasts, and the paper in front, the books around it, and the tables and chairs beside him A little bit of dark red jam, milky white cheese. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chloe stunned awkwardly, his hands touched his head directly, and after confirming that it still existed, he was shocked to look around. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still in the study, there is still a draft full of handwriting in front of it, which is a deduction of the content of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is it that the over-exertion of the last night caused the deep exhaustion of the soul, so I fell asleep unconsciously? And I also made an extremely terrifying nightmare!" When I think of that nightmare, Chloe has a lingering fear, and no one wants to recollect the feeling of cognizing the collapse of the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But, how is the deduction of the dream so clear?" Chloe suddenly remembered, his hands trembled again, but with an "experience" he looked Adapted a lot, so carefully look at your own draft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while, Chloe whispered to himself: "Do you really want to make that assumption... it’s just a hypothesis..."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey, knocking on the window, Chloe saw his gas servant coming like a dream. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intensively took a few breaths and lifted the defensive magical array. Chloe took the papers from the gas servant and saw nothing unexpectedly: "The distribution of energy in the blackbody spectrum." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit quietly for half an hour, Chloe opened the paper, although it can be assigned to disciples and cooperative arcanes review, but he still wants to see Confirmed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the formula is to be established, it must be assumed that the emission and absorption of energy are discontinuous, but one copy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chloe closed his eyes and leaned against the back of the chair. The disordered movement of the cognitive world became more and more chaotic, but this was a "re-emergence" of the impact, and he was prepared. A lot of violent disorder has reached chaos. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is just a hypothesis...this is just a hypothesis..." Chloe’s voice is faint and weak, nose, eyes, mouth, ears, etc. Dark red blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it is prepared, this violates his world-based cognition or makes his meditation environment shake sharply and hurts the soul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fortunately for the time being just a hypothesis..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the window, wearing a red magic robes The master sighed softly, and Affris, who was quietly on one side, sneaked into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All high-level arcans, what he is most worried about is this disciple, starting with his theory, but getting the hypothesis of violating his other theory, Very dangerous for the cognitive world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recovered for three hours, Chloe’s vertigo only slightly receded. Looking at the paper on the table, he showed a little fear in his eyes, like a face For a terrible enemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
