			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did I have been stupid, even a few small Druids of the 3rd and 4th level can be messed up and destroyed in front of them?"<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electric flashing thunderous roars reverberate on the 33rd floor. The legendary magicians and masters of the highest scoring group are subconsciously leaning back, their brows are wrinkled, no one wants Enjoy the storm that dominates your screams, although it is only for Douglas Speaker, not yourself. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas’s expression is unchanged, and kindly, very accustomed to calmly screaming in the face of the storm’s roar: “Fernando, you and Hathaway, Vicente’s mission is With Malfurion, break the mystery of natural magic as soon as possible. If there is any need to discuss, I can interrupt the current experiment at any time, I believe that Brooke, Oliver and Helen are very happy."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient magicians who founded the Magic Council with him gradually eliminated a lot with the development of the Arcane. There are only five remaining in the highest panel. The other six Arcanists are even more of Douglas's juniors, and even two of them are more or less his students, so only he has the qualification to call the names of the rest of the Supreme Council instead of his last name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle-aged gentleman with wig, gold-rimmed glasses, black double-breasted long dress, black-haired black, and aristocratic middle-aged Man Oliver? Constantine, the lips are black, like Helen, the beautiful snow and ice elf? Paris nodded slightly, no matter how big their differences were, how many competitions there were in the dark, and they expressed their willingness to help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can crack the mystery of natural magic, it means going further and breaking the "God's Secret" of the Church of Truth, once the "evil" magician You can get the "gift of the gods" and display the magic. Most of the pastors, bishops, and paladins of the church will surely shake their minds completely, or be swallowed up by the Holy Light, or lose all the power of magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a crucial thing for the Magic Council! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, Fernando, do you think the church will quietly watch us crack after discovering this? You think those against the spirit in Stroop Forest After sending out the natural hateful sentiment, will not quietly inform the church?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language logic step by step, Douglas, although the tone is gentle, but the storm dominates Fernando Can't speak, the superpower who has stood for hundreds of years has his own aggressive side. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To face the destruction of the church, and to crack the mystery of natural magic as soon as possible, the pressure on you is so great, so I don't want to see you for these little guys. Distraction, it is best to eliminate hidden dangers in advance."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this is the case, the other members of the Supreme Council understand that the Lord’s concern is actually the church’s madness. The main topic of today's meeting is definitely how to guard against them, and the little devils who deal with the chaos are just aperitifs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry, Speaker Douglas, I am reckless. Although Feile Bell has been very restrained, this kind of thing is not something he wants to restrain and can restrain." Fernando readily acknowledged his mistake. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposite of his round table is a middle-aged pale man in a black cloak, skinny as if the skin is directly wrapped around the bones, and the dark red is beating in both eyes. flame. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s whispered: “Beyond arcane and magic problems, you’re always thinking too little about the old metamorphosis. I think you should separate those druids directly. Out, marginalization. In order to prevent them from perceiving or making excuses, they can give them an arcane division who has a great reputation but actually has little energy to invest in this research."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp By Vicente calling out his nickname, the storm dominated Fernando but did not seem to care completely: "So Vicente will never dare to argue with me about mathematical problems, basic problems of arcane..."<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The soul of the dead dominates you, what level of fame is needed to make these Druids think that the research team they entered is one of the core groups?" The legendary magician Klaus asked in a cooperative manner. One sentence, let Vicente not be stunned by Fernando. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicette looked at Hathaway, who sat quietly like a statue, and said uncomfortably: "I think an immortal throne winner, one The Holm Crown Award winner is enough. Felipe has been conducting his own experiments recently and can only take time to look at it, without the energy to participate in the study, and the element will be the Lucerne Evans actually the Arcane and Magic Water. The guidelines did not reach the level of breaking the mystery of the magic or completing the requirements of Malfurion. Ms. Florenza arranged for him to come in and just study. With the two of them taking the lead, the research team was very convincing to the Druids. ."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good proposal, I think we can achieve the goal. Teacher, what do you think?" In the rumor, because the essence of the spirit is wave or particle and Douglas is not allowed, Brooke is a student of Douglas, but their attitude is cold, it seems to be as Rumors say. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before Douglas nodded, Hathaway suddenly spoke, and the gray-gray eyes looked at all members of the Supreme Council: "One person leads a group and thinks of those The druids to be chaotic are separated."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas nodded lightly: "The proposal of Hathaway is very good, can't let them hold the group, must first split If you don't have any opinions, then we will start to discuss how to prevent the church."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Douglas Magic School, Lucien's Garden Villa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This did not see you in a few days, our familiar rookie teacher Lucien Evans turned out to be the Holm Crown Award winner, and The youngest winner!” Roque yelled around Lucien. “How do you feel now? Our big man, the fastest ever, has never been a regular Arcane level. ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at Rock's appearance, Lucien felt that he had the talent to become a journalist, and then smiled slightly: "I am no different from before. It’s just that the eyes of others have changed. I think if I take Rock's project from the previous project, I might be able to swindle the funds.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exaggeration Rocke shifted his attention and sighed: "There is a reputation for having a good position. I see that some of the intermediate-level Arcanists' research projects are not as good as I thought, but I can apply for the funds. Lucien, do you have any? I will give you some inspiration when I apply for a research project, or wait for me to become a middle class. I will be your assistant!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrecognized Rock's gibberish, familiar teachers like Jerome and Verne continue to look incredulously Road to Sean, looking at the Holm crown ring worn on his right hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a long time, Vernier said: "I can work with a Holm Crown Award winner for so long, and we will have something to show off later." Story. But I really can't believe that you have been suspended from class some time ago, and you are still learning the basics of the Arcane. You suddenly got the highest honor in the field of elemental magic, which is more amazing than my sudden becoming a high-level magician." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pause, she seems to think of something and laughed: "In Holm popular men send a lady ring to propose, and such a beautiful to make people enchanted Strong, to the ring that makes the enemy fear, plus the young, beautiful and elegant Lucian you, I think no one can resist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "When it comes to suspension, Beyat once again jointly complained to Lucien, and you think that you always go out on time, and don't take the responsibility of teaching apprentices at all, asking you to be expelled from school. As a result, their complaints. Just sent to President Donald, the "Element" of that issue The publication was published, haha, when they saw the papers, their faces were quite wonderful, just like the beautiful skirts of different colors of women kept changing. Yesterday, after you got the news of the Holm Crown Award, it was said that Yate also broke the beloved Camelot white glazed porcelain cup."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If Lucien your research is to hit the results of their cognition Better..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock was very happy and slightly regretted to share with Bayside the fact that Beyat was hit by their arrogance, and Lucy When I came back today, I met a few teachers who were dissatisfied with myself, but they were far away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, who is the letter you are holding to? It’s a thick one." Silently intimate Jerome is keenly aware of the road. Sean holds a thick letter in his hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien shook his left hand: "To a friend in the distance." When I packed up the books and books, Lucien spent more than an hour giving it to Na. Tasha wrote a letter, mainly to share the experience of the journey, the feelings of music, and the use of the timid chorus to express himself safely and get the Holm crown ring, some of which was transferred by Tona Tasha to John. In the end, Natasha helped to look after Joel. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So thick? Hey, Lucien, are you writing to your little lover? She must be beautiful and gentle, or how would you Turning a blind eye to these beautiful women.” Married woman Vernia joked, “When will she receive her from Allinge, you are already a level 4 arcane master, a magician, and qualified enough. ”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
