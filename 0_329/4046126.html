			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wind, no vibration, no raindrops, gray stars can't see the stars, lock all the solid silence of the world, but in the big cross frame The bloody red liquid under the cover seems to be vibrating and swaying like a vitality, and the dark red color contrasts with the black, white and gray background of the whole world, even though Lucien is so good at keeping calm and The dedicated magician is involuntarily guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien carefully looked at the big cross-shaped star frame, and the book "Stars and Elements" in the Soul Library turned to the corresponding position for comparison: "It's not like the use of the magic tower to protect the magic tower. It seems to concentrate on what most of the power is sealing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of this possibility, the road Sean once again carefully watched the shaking red blood liquid for a few seconds, then corrected the position of the magic garden position based on the position indicated by the reflection of the nine stars. After getting accurate results, he turned and walked down the lake without hesitation. The side road runs to the edge of the Black Forest in the west, where there is a recent magic garden. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a lot of curiosity about what seals, but I understand that fans who are not officially capable are close to the legendary level. Lock seals are simply looking for death, can not be confused by greed, can not confuse the main purpose. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faint gray-white afterimage flashed, and the moonlight bloodline recovered a lot of self-healing ability. Lu Xien quickly left the lakeside path and entered "The veritable" Black Forest. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremely quiet, can't see any living thing, even the leaves are not shaking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this depressing woods, Lucien was counting distance, and after ten minutes he saw a huge building covered in dark shadows. From time to time, the ray of light was drawn and fell to the direction of Lake Elsinore. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slowed down, his right hand clasped the "vigilant" sword, the closer he was to the magic garden, the more he dared not relax, although the "big cross star frame" Most of the power of the locks comes from the earth, the sun and the nine stars, but the magical garden that forms the self-circulation is also a useful supplement. It is impossible to prevent the magic traps or magic arrays that others have to break into. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black "bat brain pituitary" appeared in Lu Xien's left hand, silent spells read, invisible fluctuations spread with Lu Xien as the center, wait Reflected after the obstacle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tall black firs are formed in the mind of Lucien, and the scene within a few hundred meters is gradually clear, but the ultrasonic detection can only return to the approximate Shapes, many strange things that are still and motionless, make it impossible to judge what it is. As for the living creatures, there is no such thing as alive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While checking the magic traps, Lucien was careful to move forward, and when he was close to a strange thing he had just discovered, he found it to be a weird black. Big stone, not something dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly relieved, Lucien continued to move forward. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is another strange thing in front of it, it may be a stone..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bypassing the thick Some of the bushes, with a dark vision, Lucien immediately saw the strange thing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a tombstone carved out of stone, showing a dark black in the world of locks and a layer of faint ash, behind it is A small tomb. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tombstone is engraved with a white line: "The noble and brave David? Mr. Xie Trang, who became a small town in Bonn because he had executed many heretics. The mayor, but died because he fell in love with someone. Well, although he fell in love with a man, a man with strong strength."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the face of this black humor epitaph, Lucien’s mouth was slightly twitching. If he remembered it correctly, he once saw this tombstone when he sneaked into the town of Bonn, but it was located in the town’s cemetery instead of the Black Forest: “Is the cemetery moved here in the world of locks?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The graveyard behind the tomb is filled with many black cross tombstones without graves, in black and white gray background Against the backdrop, it is particularly gloomy and cold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this will delay a few minutes, it is much safer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just turned and clenched the "vigilance" of Lucien once again, the feeling of erect hair, cold and infiltrating, so he did not hesitate to slash the sword Behind me. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if hitting a decaying wood-like touch and a huge force at the same time, through the vigilance, Lucien’s arm numb, tumbling forward The body is rapidly moonlit. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hitting a tombstone on the edge of the cemetery, Lucien jumped up and jumped down and took the opportunity to turn around. The corner of his eye saw the pale text on the black cross tombstone. :<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I used to be fat, but I finally got thin."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughing In the black, cold soil behind the epitaph, suddenly a rotten palm was stretched out, and then a humanoid body with a rotten flesh, white bones, and stench was sitting up with the dirt. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien turned to see the same undead creature, David? Mr. Shetrien’s tomb door has been opened! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien turned into a residual image, guarding the sword to slash forward, chasing Lu Xien’s undead creatures quickly, instinctively flashing to the side Long sword, rushing toward Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long sword has spare time, just took an arc and just stopped in front of him. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the silent collision, the vigilant sword trembled rapidly, and the power of the undead creature surpassed Lucien, and smelled the stench and rotten smell. Lucien is suffering from aching pain, a hot forehead, and a slight paralysis of the body! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ghoul!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien from this undead creature sharp teeth and fight The feature recognizes its type, which is much more reluctant than the ordinary one. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this weirdly locked world, it is more than a formal knight, speed and agility are not much worse than Lucien, power is better than a little. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul has an undead creature name, and the whole body is covered with a corpse aura and negative energy. As long as it is hit by it, the whole person will be paralyzed and unable to move. And transfected with the epidemic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if killed by it, it will become a new ghoul after a day. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After recognizing the type of undead, Lucien began to fight, not in front of the first ghoul, and the second ghoul The strength seems to be weaker than the first one, speed and agility can not keep up, can only be anxiously chasing the afterimage of Lu Xien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with a gnome without a sense of spirit, Lucien gradually gained the upper hand and watched the sword from time to time on it, although every time it was like a blow In the middle of a thick piece of wood, it can't be completely cut off, but it also makes the rotted muscles of the ghoul fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Lucien is preparing for the "Sulphur Fire Wall" magic, trying to quickly remove the ghoul. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ghoul is getting more and more crazy, suddenly screaming silently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scream did not cause any harm to Lucien, but Lucien saw a rotten arm in the cemetery suddenly protruding out, with black The cross constitutes a peculiar landscape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So many undead?? Is it as powerful as this one?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucien screamed at the opportunity to scream, and in front of it a cloth with a white flame, sulphur smell pungent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Lucien’s head did not return and fled to the place where he came, so many undead creatures could not be solved by themselves, if there is another similar Ghoul, I am afraid I don’t even know how to die. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sword chopped to block his second ghoul, Lucien just fled but smelled a strong rancid disgusting taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
