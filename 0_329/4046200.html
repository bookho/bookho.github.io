			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the warm sun illuminates Allinge, and a carriage follows a secluded road towards a broad building in a dark green forest. Things. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, when you report, I will take you to Jerome and Rock, and then you can exchange books recorded from the library. "Lazard, who still has a black double-breasted long dress, glanced at the desolate forest in the window. "But you have to remember that you can't privately exchange new magic created or improved by others unless it has passed. A hundred years period."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The learning of arcane and magical knowledge is hard to detect by others, and it is also the acquiescence of the parliament, but this new magic is only for you. Being discovered and used, and not having a record of learning at the 'Magic Exchange Hall' or its inventors, is a very serious crime, either paying a hundred times the money for its exchange price, or will be put into the banned prison ten Years, and high-level magicians use hypnosis to erase this memory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien Ning focus: "I know."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time Lucien’s strategy for the Magic Council is very Appreciation, in the theory of arcane and magic, the author's papers and books will have arcane points and arcane points rewards when they pass the review, but there will be no income from the Arcane points in the future. The scores of the books, so the authors of the books in the library actually hope that their books will be exchanged free of charge, which will increase their possibility of being cited. For the magicians to communicate privately, as long as the Magic Council acquiesced, no one will take care of it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the new magic directly means strength, not for the arcane points and the subsequent rich arcane points, no magician is willing to hand over, must be strictly protected . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, in fact, there are a lot of unique magic inside the major organizations that have not been submitted to the Arcane Review Committee, such as our 'Elemental Will' and Holm Royal The Magic Court has a legendary magic 'elemental decomposition' of the great Arcanian Lord Hathaway. As long as you join the 'Elemental Will', you can redeem and try to analyze this magic after you become a nine-ring magician, and lay down for the advanced legend. A solid foundation.” Lazar did not miss any opportunity to promote the benefits of joining the elements. Of course, this was because he regarded Lucien as his friend and was more optimistic about his future. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien’s expression is not too good: “When I have a formal Arcane level, I will consider it.”<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, due to Natasha’s relationship with the “professor” in the dark, Lucien is inclined to join the will of the element, so that even if the professor’s identity is exposed later, there will be big organizations and big brothers for themselves. Supporting the waist, but since Lu Xien has crossed this world of souls, how can he not be interested in similar knowledge? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if you really want to join the will of the element, Lucien will join in the attitude of being valued, not like those originally recruited by the 'Pale Hand'. Wilfrid is the same as the Necromancer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thing made Lucien a fresh memory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar understands the reason why Lucien has no smile, no more to say, hehe smiled: "Lu Xien, you are still heartbroken to buy materials Money?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well.” Lucien’s expression was ugly, and the seventeen purified elements took up two high-quality seas. Meteorite, now there is only one high-quality sea bream stone, two Jintale, an arcane point and ether, goblin hair and other miscellaneous materials, and officially entered the 'civilian' class inside the magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazar took a pat on the shoulder and comforted: "You should be glad that there are the remaining forty-eight elements of purification in the magic school. When you apply for an experiment." It can be 90% cheaper than the outside. And if it is your turn to guide the apprentices to do the magic experiment of familiar element surnames, then a copper fair does not need flowers. Oh, the magic school also provides small garden villas for teachers. Living, you have to save the cost of renting a house, how good work."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is true." Lucien is only slightly depressed, it is not enough. In fact, it is still relatively calm. At the same time, the Douglas School of Magic has been returned to the "Organic Arcanist Monthly" as a contact point and submitted to the "Magician Management Department". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carriage slowly stops in front of the black iron gate that is filled with the spires of the ancient magical empire, a black, magical, black and shiny statue Come over and open the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien, a white shirt, brown vest and double-breasted black long dress, sat at the desk. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the opposite side of Lucien, is a bald-headed bald old man, wearing a black inlaid silver-white ancient magician robe, except for the blue eyes In addition, the appearance is very ordinary, not fat or thin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am the principal of Douglas Magic School, Donald. Welcome Evans to join us." The bald old man smiled and nodded, finishing a document in his hand. The chest wears the badge of the four-level Arcanist and the five-ring magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien stood up, politely took off his black top hat and held it in his chest, whispering: "Hello, President Donald, you can Call me Lu Xien directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, fortunately, another Evans in our school likes others to call him K, or Mr. K, or else I shout Lucine’s words, I’m afraid everyone doesn’t know who to refer to.” Donald found a document and handed it to Lucien. “This is a course offered by our school. Let’s take a look.”<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took the file and looked at it carefully. It has "Universal Language", "Ancient Magic Empire Language", "Abyss", "Hell Word", "Magic Pharmacy (Primary) ), "Elemental Basis", "Electromagnetic Foundation", "Death Foundation", "Magic Structure (Primary)", "Alchemy Foundation"... "Magic Array Introduction", "Magic Analysis", "Summon Common Sense" ... "Introduction to some national customs", "magic history", "music class". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Music lessons?" Other courses, Lucien can understand, but actually saw music lessons here. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donald touched his white beard and laughed: "Let the apprentices relax properly. Lucien, you come across from the Stormwind Strait. Are you good at musical instruments? Do you want to have any music lessons? Last month, a magician who was also a music teacher was dismissed because of a violation of the school rules and a close relationship with the female apprentice. We are just nervous."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, Lucien, you are a handsome young man, don't violate the school rules, it's better to be farther away from the beautiful female apprentices - they are knowledgeable, A powerful and handsome magic teacher is always full of good feelings. If there is something that makes you feel excited, let her drop out of school, so that it does not violate the school rules."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Because of the continuous consumption of money yesterday, Lucien did not put the female apprentices in mind, and subconsciously asked: "If I am a music class, can I get a little more salary?" I am not interested in the apples. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, there are two more arcane points per month." Donald nodded easily. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien replied without hesitation: "I am good at piano and violin." If you are not afraid of being tired of John, Lucien is in the Kingdom of Holm. The plan for the concert was over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A good young man, the same as the musician of the same name and the same name." Donald did not entangle here, continued: "Road Sean, you have just arrived in the parliament, you have not yet laid the foundations of arcane and magic, so I will arrange for you to teach the three courses of 'Ancient Magic Empire Language', 'Magic Creatures' and 'Hell Words', two classes a week. A total of ten lessons, what do you have?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Hell and Abyss are involved in magical contracts, summoning rituals, etc., the magicians of the ancient magical empire They are very good at it, and there is also a corresponding introduction in "The Book of Astrology and Elements". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No comments, but can I pick a class?" Lucien tried to ask if they could continue to teach Annick, they would be fine. Several apprentices were guided by their own talents, and there was also a sense of satisfaction. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, anyway, I have to reschedule the teachers in these courses." Donald had no objection, letting Lucien choose two formal magic apprentice classes, inside In the "Thorn Tree" class where new apprentices such as Annick are located, the music class is also the class that serves concurrently. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arranged in the course of the road and the room in the garden villa, Donald hands with his hands, against his chin, very serious: "Lu Xien, There is one thing, I think I need to tell you first."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" President Donald, please speak." Lucien answered sincerely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
