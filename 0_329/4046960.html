			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is high and low, fluttering, people can not find the specific location of Sharp, and in the hotel, one after another, the flash disappears, it is just Fernando and other magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Try to escape, see Lake Ramallag in the land of thousands of lakes!" Douglas's figure just emerged in the corner, Fernando's soul connection is alert and He extended his tacit understanding and told him where he had met after the loss. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not his fear of the "blue gift" Sharp, in the presence of the nine-ring Archmage Douglas, he believes that it is possible to kill each other after joining forces, after all, Douglas Knowing that "time stop" is the leader among the Archmage, and he himself will have many high-order magical spells. Although he can't compete with the Golden Knight, he can influence, interfere, weaken and limit each other. The battle of the same order presented a one-sided situation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, here is Renttat, under the care of many strong people, the movement is slightly larger, it will be noticed, besieged, if Nexel One of the two in the palace or the Glorious Cathedral, and he and others have no possibility of surviving - "Sword of Truth" Williamson? Hofenberger accepted the invitation of the church and went to the front line of Aalto. The guard of Nexel Palace is the "heart of time" Ketonia, which is the name that makes the legendary magician tremble! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since his birth, young, strong, energetic, he followed Williams? Hofenberger, killing one powerful magician, sea, elf, vampire, devil and demon, paved his own path to the epic field with their bones, and then killed The legendary magician "Lord of Shadows" Osiris, the dark epic knight "faceless", stepping on their heads, promoted the legendary second-order, the name of the glory, the timid! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the battles was his promotion to the Epic Knight less than a decade ago, in a routine hunt, he and the Sylvanas before the Magic Empire" The Governor of Holm District, "The Lord of Shadows", met with Osiris. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a powerful magician who has lived for at least four thousand years. It was so close to the legendary third-order, but unfortunately it never failed. He left the "magic holy place" of Antilles, succeeding the missing "disaster king" Viken to become the "Holm area governor", mastered this part of the territory, and then in the "Twilight War", was "sword of truth" Huo Fenberger teamed up with a Saint-class cardinal to raid, suffered heavy losses and mysteriously disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the stormy strait territory of the Sylvanas Magic Empire - "Great Holm Area" fell into a situation where the dragons have no heads, several qualifications and strengths The poor legendary wizards did not obey anyone, and even did not unite with the legendary wizards of the Arthurian Empire. Under the separation of the Church of Truth and the Knights of the Nobles, one after another fell, and achieved the glory of the "Sword of Truth". Let him be one of the only nine legendary third-order epic knights. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows that in the "Great Holm area" fell apart, after the new generation of noble knights grew up, "the Lord of Shadows" Osiris "lived" again Come back, met the "heart of time" Ketonia. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that battle, Yu Bo destroyed most of the witnesses, leaving only a few people. According to them, the "Heart of Time" destroyed the "shadow" After the death of the Lord, he said with great enthusiasm: "You are old, even the soul and the spell are 'corrupted'..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also Unraveling some of the magician's doubts, in normal terms, the Master can suppress the same-level knights, even if they have special blood, they are mostly flat or almost, never heard of which epic knight can be in the single-on-one battle. Killing the legendary magician, initially, the magicians suspected that the "Lord of Shadows" had not completely recovered from the fatal wounds caused by the Saint-Chutric Cardinal and the "Sword of Truth", and the strength fell sharply. Now, they are again There is a strong reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, "The Lord of Shadows" Osiris is too old to approach the limits of his life, the souls are beginning to decay, mental power and magical strength Naturally reduced greatly! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this made the magicians’ self-esteem a little better, they soon had to face up to the problem that not only the “Lord of Shadows” was old, Even the magical empire seems to be old and decaying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these hundreds of years of war, one young and another cardinal or epic knight was born, and many of them were similar to The leader of the Heart of Time, such as the "ruling angel" Rudolph, for example, became the cardinal in front of the Pope, and among the three magical empire, the newly promoted legendary magician is rare and nothing. The five-year-old "young man" reveals a marked aging decay. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even many veteran magicians lamented: "The old will eventually be replaced by young ones. This is an irreversible fate. In front of young, energetic and energetic truth churches and nobles, magicians and magic empire are like An old body that has long decayed, and it fell down with a poke."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know why, these ideas flashed in the heart of Douglas, let him rise Inexplicable sorrow, then, he controlled the fluctuations of emotions, intending to use the "shadow" to jump out of Sharp's lock and help other magicians to escape. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You must first escape, don't worry about them!" Old Green suddenly flew up, floating in the air, blocking the drop of water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a dull, sluggish, irritated, dead green left eye that becomes dark and dark, seemingly hiding a bottomless pit that can absorb all life. The hole. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas understands the meaning of Old Green, and other magicians who don’t even have high rankings die, and the nine-ring Master is The hope of the renaissance of the magical empire, but he still hesitated a little, while also aware that the previous fight did not attract the attention of nearby churches. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midair, Sharp’s voice came with a slap in the water: “I’m blocking the neighborhood’s before I’m out, no one is aware, I have something to say to you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, his figure suddenly appeared in the lobby of the small hotel, and he walked into the bar and poured himself A glass of spirits. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas did not start, and Fernando, who had left with Old Green and the other people, looked at each other with a deep surprise, and also had a faint hope. produce. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp took the initiative to uncover this matter, not deliberately squatting at the church, is there also the idea of ​​working with trade unions? Has his idea been approved by Aalto’s "Sword of Truth"? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remember to pay for the money and house repairs." Old Green fell and returned to a state of ruin. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando stepped into the hall and said to Sharp, who was drinking alcohol: "What?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharp snorted: "I want to kill a person, and it is not easy for me to do it. It is said that your magician will accept such a commission?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who?" Douglas Pressed the hand, indicating that Fernando is not impulsive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His calm and calm attitude made Fernando take a face, resisted the irony of Sharp's timid thoughts, and listened carefully to his answer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharp took another drink and laughed again: "Alfonso, the person I want to kill is Alfonso."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alfonso? There are many people who call this name, but they mainly focus on the countries around the holy city of Reims. In Lentstadt, there are only a few answers to this name. Among them, one that makes Sharp inconvenient is only one! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cardinal Alfonso?" The old Greenwood’s eyes shone with deep light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando was also taken aback, the deputy head of the "Sword of Truth" Knights, the Golden Knight "Deep Blue Gift", actually entrusted the "evil" magician Assassination of a nine-level cardinal? This is really a weird thing! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, he is an extreme advocate of the Lord, thinking that all authority has to be attributed to the Lord, and that the nobility is also a Lamb, so we don't get along very well." Pleasant." Sharp looked at the three people with a smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Cardinal Alfonso is a ninth-level cleric, the main assistant of the "God Angel" Franz, the true Holm Diocese The giants..." Douglas also did a collection of information about Rentatt during this time, and "Angel of the Angels" Franz is one of the two pastor of the Holy Spirit who stayed in the Straits of the Straits of the Truth Church. You can add a name before the name. The third-order powerhouse of the word "圣"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Green reopened his eyes: "Alfonso will not leave Rantat basically, who can assassinate him under the protection of Franz? Unless he does not want to live ......"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
