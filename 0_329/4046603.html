			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden changes made the legendary powerhouses in midair stunned, and the battles that were temporarily separated due to the "eternal blaze" broke out. All condensed into two kinds of gods besieged Pope Benedict II, waiting for the final result. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the emotions of the two sides have very different differences. The legendary magicians are both happy and worried. The "Abyss Will" is notoriously chaotic without Reason, when the Pope is killed by Him, He will surely launch indiscriminate killing and destruction. As the headquarters of the Parliament, the loss will be very heavy. Maybe only the legendary magicians such as Douglas, Brooke and Hathaway Several arcanists can survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, the Pope and the gods will take care of Douglas, they will weigh, will consider whether it affects people on their own side, it is easier to be entangled, "Abyss "The will" has no such concerns at all. Even if the demon monarchs appear here, He will kill them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a mess that doesn't even have its own real name. It's completely unnamed..." Douglas frowned. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Abyss Will" is the code name for the Taikoo Dragons to facilitate his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If He is not defeated by the Pope, I am afraid to rely on the help of Silvermoon. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yinyue Aitna is notoriously nosy, and he observes the world as if he is a true god, and rarely intervenes in anything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute, I have to go up..." Douglas would rather face the Pope, at least he would take into account the problem of consuming his own life when he performed God. The Abyss will "play a "God-like blast" at any time, and then spend a long time recovering from the abyss - He never measures the ratio between gains and losses. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing that makes Douglas feel at ease is that Melmos was seriously injured and the king of angels was seriously injured. Hathaway was enough to hold them both and not to be The church took the hole and waited until Brooke came back and the big picture was fixed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Cardinal Mission have only fear and fear. If the Pope’s Majesty is here, it will be the first death in history. The Pope, this confidence in the church will cause an incalculable blow, and if the "Abyss Will" and the "Silver of the Silver Moon" win, it is still a problem for oneself to wait for a few to live back. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The King of Angels" Mecanthon sees the situation so developed, there is no longer the idea of ​​consuming the legend of the church, after all, if the Holy Spirit pastor and the sacred are fallen again The Cavaliers, without enough power to shake the enemy, the church will certainly fall into the end of the magical empire wall, when the dark parliament, the northern church, the magic parliament will be like a bloody tiger shark Until now, no matter what your plan is, you must attach to the behemoth of the church. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Focus on the transmission array, return to Lance, I use the 'Guardian of God' to temporarily resist."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The voice of Mecanthron sounded in the hearts of every Cardinal member, letting their worries disappear, and began to quietly go to the ultra-large transmission. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what the Pope’s Majesty is, as long as he does not lose the Lord’s care, the Holy See will come over! And the attitude of the king of angels is proof! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sky in the northeast of the city, "The Night Walker" Winston is also separated from the "heart of time" Ketonia, both looking at the "falling silver moon" "And the deep black chaos of the ruined ball" hit the Pope in an unstoppable, inescapable gesture. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His Creton, you see, the result is already doomed..." Winston could not persuade him to persuade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ketonia seems to be a lot old and looking at the sky and falling into a sad silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing that the two gods’ full-strike blows are about to hit the pope, the heights are suddenly changing, and the pope slams a layer of majestic, sacred The milky white light makes the surrounding space and time solidify, so that "silver moon" and "chaos" can only move slowly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope Benedict II has a flat and sincere smile on his face, with the peace of mind and dedication, lifting the Platinum Scepter, singing like a sacred singer: Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s an instant, and it’s eternal.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It’s the creator and the master.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every prayer will sound, and his body will be much bleak, and in the city of Rentatt, in the major cities of the Kingdom of Holm, in the major cities of the Kingdom of Burrian... All the clergy, believers in the holy city of Lans Once again, I was moved to the inexplicable, all joyfully and timidly, and followed the prayers:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are one, also 10,000."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is an instant, and it is eternal."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope His Majesty used the 'God Drops' again..." The supporters of the popes such as Melmos, Anasta, and Maria had grief and pain on their faces, and they knew this. The cost of God's fall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the strength of the Pope’s subordinates, he will not be killed by the “Silver Moon” and the “Abyss” after being seriously injured by God. However, in order to inflict and expel these two gods, he chose "God Drop"...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clearly visible seven-story Heaven Mountain projection appeared in Behind Pope Benedict II, the Holy Spirit and the Angels on the first to fifth floors sang beautiful and ethereal sacred lyrics, playing with ethereal and mellow melody, a little light fluttering from them, gathering together into a super-extraordinary light toward the sixth The layer and the seventh layer rush. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six blazing angels on the sixth floor, all with their hands crossed to the ground, the wings covered the whole body, seemingly praying. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the Holy Light poured into the highest level, pilgrimage to the boundless, unspeakable light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pope Benedict II looks at "Silver Moon" and "Abyss", solemnly: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "This is the most just trial, from the supreme Lord, and both immortality and evil will be purified."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indescribable holy light burst in the heavenly mountain projection The silver moon and the abyss are bright and bright, and one reveals the deepest, deepest and most chaotic darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All colors and sounds are instantly deprived, and the mighty peaks of Douglas and other legendary peaks can only sense one meter away from the mental field. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a tragic horror to the extreme mourning sounded, the feeling of loss of everyone suddenly returned. Hathaway and others saw that there were several deep cracks in the unnamed meatballs. Countless hands, feet, eyes, and heads were blasting, like flying back into the deep red door. Then, the crimson door was devastated and disappeared without a trace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, a round of silver moon rises again, but it is much more dimmed than it was just now, and it is gradually covered up by the sun. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath rushed toward the city of Rentt, the silver-gray pupil of Hathaway shrunk slightly, whispering:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Elements bless."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold, silver, white, black, countless spots condensed into a semi-spherical ball to cover the city stand up. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The magnetic field collapses."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the singularity of Qingyao, the shield of the elements There is another layer of dark black twisted space, the burst of suction swallows most of the aftermath, and the rest is blocked by the “Elements of Blessing”. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full-fledged god-dropping attack has smashed both types of gods? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this result is expected, such a terrible force still makes Douglas, Melmos and others continue to stare upwards. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sky, Pope Benedict II still holds the Platinum Scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope is okay?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legendary magicians witnessed the joy that Brooke came back from being wiped out by heavy pressure. How many "God Drops" can Benedict II use? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a gust of wind blew, Benedict II’s clothes turned into a little bit of shards, and then the hands, feet, torso, and head were all shattered. Light spots, falling and falling, disappeared in the air. Under the sun, they reflect all kinds of splendor, making people feel both dreamy and shocking. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ethereal voice of the holy voice and the melody of the music sounded as if the god of truth was guiding the returning spokesperson to the mountain of heaven. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope’s Majesty the Lord is called..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mermos mutter Self-talking, this is the first pope to die directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope has fallen..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas instantly woke up and once again exhibited a wide range of souls Line, commanding other legendary magicians: "Break them!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magic Council originally had no appetite, because the great arcans such as Douglas were sober. Knowing the strength gap between myself and the Southern Church, I never thought about fighting the church with you from start to finish. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their goals have not changed, that is, to destroy two or three cardinal members with the "eternal blaze" that is prepared in advance and not known to the church, to reverse the Contrasting the strength of the draw, and then through this shock and the darkness of the parliament, and the scruples of the Pope's display of the gods, let the nobles fall to their side, forcing the church to take the initiative to end the war and evacuate the storm across the strait. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, it’s a war! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation has developed to the present, even the pope has fallen on the battlefield, and Douglas naturally changed the goal accordingly, that is, the cardinal group that killed the church to the greatest extent. Members, bite a bit of flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kitonia in the northeast of the city saw the pope fall, his face changed again and again Just when Winston wanted to persuade again, he suddenly broke out the most violent attack, and Winston couldn’t breathe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Winston’s pressure was steep, and Ketonia in front of him had already flown away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It seems that he still does not believe that surrender will have good results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And he wanders Outside, Her Majesty will have scruples when dealing with members of his family. After all, a legendary strongman who is shameless and desperate to do assassination and destruction is too difficult to guard against... This is a balance... "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, Lord Ketonia, you are almost eight hundred years old, even if you have the power of time, how long can you live? At that time..." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The normal epic knight is a life of more than five hundred years old. If it breaks through the legendary third order, it will probably grow by about 100 years old. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding gravity changes again, making it difficult for others to act, Mel When Morton understood Douglas's thoughts, there was no sorrow in his heart. At this time, only five or six cardinal members entered the "guardian of the gods" and were about to enter the transmission array. Others still had a paragraph. Distance, including yourself and the back of Anasta, Maria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the remnants of Platinum’s scepter in the sky were free to fall, and a beautiful trajectory passed through Douglas’s gravitational field, Brook’s electromagnetic field, and Going below. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black hair has already had a white spot, Anasta’s eyes have become deep, as if the blue water is not visible to the end, he inexplicably extends his right hand, just right I caught the Platinum Scepter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven-story paradise mountain reappears, and the light shrouds Anasta. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred songs and songs also surround him, transforming the surroundings into sacred and difficult to invade. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
