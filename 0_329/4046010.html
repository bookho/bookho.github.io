Well, it’s all thanks to everyone’s reward yesterday, so that I can squeeze with the gods. Thank you. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.......................................................................................... ......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of such a horrible scene, Lucian really has a feeling of shaking hands and feet, what is going on, what should be done, what should not be done When the thoughts got confused and reacted to the surface, Lucien was scared to stay there and completely unresponsive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holy emblem, etc., I also have the holy emblem of truth!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flustered road Sean thought of his greatest reliance, subconsciously concentrated, want to read the mantra, and stimulate a circle of magical "Shield of Light", no matter how, protecting yourself is the most important. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha!" At this moment, the thunderous snoring sounded in Lucien’s ear, letting Lucien’s back tighten, the cold hair was vertical, and the confusion was confused. A stagnation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lighting." Gary's calm voice was introduced into Lucien's ear, just snoring, and Lucien, Correa, and Howson The person who wakes up in the confusion is Gary. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary’s calm and calm attitude infected Lucian, and he quickly recovered his minimum response. He didn’t think much, Captained the Holy Emblem and whispered Weird syllables: "Gaya."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A group of spherical white light appeared in front of Lucien and others, dispelling the deep darkness. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Lucien saw a black mouse, their size was normal, their eyes were red, they were gathered in a secret room on the ground, on the wall, humanoid strange plants On the top, dense, let Lucien can not help but scalp tight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the white light appeared, these mice were like seeing a natural enemy, howling, tidal, and coming to Lucien, Gary and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dispersal of the red-eyed mice, the appearance of the secret room is displayed in the eyes of Lucien and others, a desk in the corner, three flashes A whimsical book, a flat, wide, strange table in the center, with a lot of strange patterns on it, red, blue, green, and inexplicable with the pattern around the cross of the "Truth of Truth" Similar, and on these patterns, there are things like small stoves, small pots, glass bottles and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it’s Lucien or Gary, it’s too late to look carefully, because the crazy mice, with stench and surprise, have already flown in front of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent Hausen, the sharp Correa, was awakened by Gary, skillfully holding a sword and a shield, leaning against Gary, left and right. Formed a simple battle. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are mice, not grotesque other monsters. Lucien, who was calmly infected by Gary, has eased the tension, but the number of mice is too large. Too much weird, or let Lucien couldn't help but feel guilty. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-eyed mouse at the head jumped up and rushed toward Lucien, his mouth open, revealing two long, pointed teeth. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien, who held the shining sword with one hand, was busy cutting the radiant sword toward the red-eyed mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightsaber that the magical summons out, sharply far better than the general knight's sword, but the road to the sword is flustered, but wrongly judged The speed and surprise of the red-eyed mouse jumping, the lightsaber can only slide past it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The place where the red-eyed mouse and the lightsaber rubbed, the black fur quickly coked and spread to the flesh, but at this time, the red-eyed mouse had already rushed to Lucien. The red pupil with shimmering indifference is so clear that the rotten smell in the mouth is faintly audible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sword is swaying, the red-eyed mouse is close at hand, Lu Xien suddenly panicked, both wanting to swing the sword back, but also want to directly extend the left hand to resist Under the contradiction, almost even the shining sword fell to the ground. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the red-eyed mouse is about to bite into his chest, Lucien is at a loss, and there is no way. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't panic, if you don't have time to resist, you will avoid the key, there is healing magic." Gary's low voice came. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correa's sharp voice sounded at the same time: "Retreat to the back, lean against us, do you have a rookie standing alone in front of you to find death?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a situation, no matter whether Gary, Correa, Hausen and others have any negative impressions on Lucien, they understand that he is holding the holy emblem. The power of Xiaoshi, even when other changes occur, is the key to turning things around. No one knows, after the red-eyed mouse, there are monsters or magic traps. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hiding the bite of the red-eyed mouse, Lucien quietly sighed and sighed again, calmed down again, and he was more experienced than Gary. After training and even high-ranking knights with rich combat experience, in the face of dangerous scenes, when faced with sudden changes, they are too young, too green, too futuristic, not everyone is born to fight, Or someone who is in danger of being able to remain calm and indifferent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first real battle of life, I can have the old hand of Gary to guide and help. It is a great luck, and I will face the battle later. And valuable experience when it is dangerous. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Lucien did not panic, while slashing the lightsaber forward, slowly moving backwards and stepping back to Gary and others. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The red-eyed mouse that has been bitten has more than one, but dozens, and behind them are the mice that come from all over the place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lightsaber is bright and sharp, the sword is worn, and there is still a faint light and shadow. Lucien’s sword is cut according to Gary’s guidance. In order to defend the main, give full play to the characteristics of the shining sword, and evade Lucine never learned any defects of swordsmanship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brilliance of this sword seems to form a pale white barrier in front of Lucien, the mice that bite the mouse, directly hit the light Above the sword, it was divided into two halves of the earth without any force. The viscera and the broken skin were black and heavy, falling heavily on the ground, without a little blood flowing out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the light sword, through the remaining light and shadow, the fur on the body also began to dry, focus, slow, or fall In front of Lucien, he was either cut by Gary and Correa on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, kid, it’s not bad, this sword killed more than a dozen monster mice directly." Correa whistled, also I don't know if he is complimenting or ironic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien himself did not like it, he was able to kill so many red-eyed mice with a sword, completely because of the mighty sword of Glory and the guidance of Gary. "I feel that the power of the Glorious Sword has begun to drain."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this killing of the red-eyed mouse, Lucien felt that she had adapted to this scene. It is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary cooperates with Lucien’s slashing sword, keeps smashing out, stabbing a long sword, and repelling the mouse that slipped through the net: “Don’t be nervous, The rest of the power is enough to kill these monsters."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being killed, the red-eyed mice flew again, this time the black pressure seems to be There are hundreds of them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is becoming more and more skilled, although he is slightly scared, worried that he can't completely block the hundreds of mice, but still fully believe in Gary and Branch. Rhea, I believe they can help them block the mice on both sides. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sword of Glory slanted from top to bottom, drawing a beautiful light and shadow in the air, oh, I don’t know how many red-eyed mice hit the sword. When I hit Lucien, the pressure on my hand doubled. As an ordinary person who had not been trained by the Cavaliers, I almost couldn’t hold the sword of glory. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many mice, even if the front of the shining sword is like raining, many half and half of the bodies are falling, but there are still dozens of breakthroughs in Lucien. Blocked, through the wall of light and shadow drawn by the shining sword. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are so many mice, Gary and Correa can not intercept the sword if they can swing five or six swords in one second!" It’s too late to get out again, thinking only with inner worries: “Perhaps the high-ranking knight attendants trained by the church will have some power similar to the magical skills.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The fierce two small shields slammed out, dozens of impact sounds merged into a creaking sound, and the red-eyed mice were directly shot and flew out, landed on the ground, pumping and pumping, and soon died completely. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correa smiled: "A good knight, not only a long sword, but also good at using shields."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Lucien breathed a sigh of relief, he continued to wield a shining sword against the attacks of the red-eyed mice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was repeated failure, and the red-eyed mice seemed to be aware of the wrong, so some of them no longer flew, ran directly from the ground, and some climbed up. The wall is ready to come from the top of the four people. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation becomes precarious. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me the head." Hausen, who has been silent and tall and strong, suddenly said. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien swayed the shining sword from the top to the bottom, blocking the mouse in the air and the ground, and asked: "To use the Holy Light Shield'?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary shook his head: "wait again."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four people Like a small boat in the stormy waves, it swayed in the red-eyed mouse that fell in the sky and fluttered in the air, and seemed to be washed away at any time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Howson’s blockade was missing, a red-eyed mouse landed on Correa’s shoulder, and Correa’s sword and shield were against the front. I was too late to guard, and I was directly biting my neck, giving a sigh of relief, shaking my shoulders and shaking the red-eyed mouse out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correa hates and says: "The wounds are numb, they appear to have a certain poisonous surname."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I am stimulating therapeutic magic." Lucien said as he sang the holy emblem with his left hand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gary stopped the road: "No hurry, Correa can hold it. It seems that there is no way to completely block it, wait a few more bites, then stimulate the treatment." The magic. "There are too many mice, and the healing of the gods is saved." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice did not fall, he also snorted, was bitten between a pair of boots and knee pads by a red-eyed mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this experience, Gary, Correa, and Howson have changed some fighting styles. Although the mouse can bite, the teeth are not sharp enough to bite. Broken armor, so they relaxed a little in places with protection of the chain armor and knee pads, and they were fully prepared to prevent other places, and the situation improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Lucien, wearing a linen jacket and trousers of the same color, without a little protection, was immediately bitten by a red-eyed mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feeling of hemp and itching rises from the ankle, and it quickly spreads up. Lucian almost stands unsteadily, and at the same time, his mouth is dry and he wants to drink. water. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are much worse than us, first use the shield of the Holy Light, and then use the healing theology." Gary distinguishes the situation, at this time the red-eyed mouse has died Almost half. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s a matter of yourself, Lucien has no delays, concentrates on it, and rubs the holy emblem:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Smen."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eccentric mysterious mantra sounded, and a pale white light shield appeared on Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien inspired a post-God surgery, the spirit can not concentrate, so one step forward, relying on the light shield and the shining sword to block all the red-eyed mice on the front . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mice who escaped the sword of glory, and the former servant attacked the shield of the light, but the light shimmers, the shield of the light does not shake a little, give Gary and Correa calmly killed and beat the mouse. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After two or three seconds, Lucien’s spirit recovered, and he once again rubbed the holy emblem, and recited the mantra of the mouth: “Gurzen.”<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white light shot from the cross of the sacred emblem, fell on the foot of Lucien, and the feeling of itching disappeared immediately. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
