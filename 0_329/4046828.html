			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning month (January), the weather in the north of Holm is still cold, the snow is flying, the knife-like breeze is roaring. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Song of the Silver Moon Alliance" in the magic tower of the Allinge Division, warm as spring, let a magician who came in feels from The inner comfort - although they have the effect of "bearing elemental damage" and "defending the cold", but the cold wind is still uncomfortable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, Julie, Happy New Year, is the "Arcane" coming today?" At the beginning of the new year, the Arcanists can come to the cold wind. It’s only this aspect of the division’s magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The female apprentice Julie who is in charge of reception is not known because of the contrast between the inside and outside, or other reasons, the cheeks are red and authentic: "Arcane and Magic are still Didn't arrive."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When finished, her eyes were bright and her voice was low: "Several gentlemen, have you heard about the Universe Observatory?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What Universe Observatory?" These arcane masters replied slyly, and they waited for the New Year to be out of date. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July’s voice grew louder and excitedly said: “The first two days came from the Institute of Atomic Research, and Lord Evans built a cosmic observatory in the stars. So that the arcane masters with insufficient magical power can also study the unknown mysteries of cosmic rays and vast stars."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" An intermediate arcane The teacher can't control his emotions, and the sound seems to be echoed in the hall like a sonic spell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you really go to the starry sky study?" The tone of another arcane master was full of doubt and unbelievable. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julie nodded hard: "Ms. Heidi and others have already gone!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The loud-hearted arcane man believed that Julie would not lie to herself in this kind of thing, so she looked up and stared at the ceiling in a daze, as if she could see the vast expanse of the sky through it and the layers of magic towers. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starry Sky······" His tone is like a sigh, because most arcane masters are full of awe and yearning for the universe. Throughout his life, he is unlikely to have a chance. Who knows, there is such a thing now. The great development of arcane really brings one miracle after another! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Arcanist’s voice was nervous and urgently asked: “Can we apply for the 'Cosmic Observatory, is it? Or the Arcanist of the Atomic Research Institute Is it qualified?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;July has not answered yet, the entrance to the Magic Tower sounds a clear and steady male voice: “Of course, Lord Evans clearly answers the Magic Research Council. , 'Essence Observatory, every time you open it. You can give the Arcane Institute two places for the Arctic Master. However, you must advance your own experimental plan and pass a rigorous review. You can't let the arcane that is simply going to feel the stars. The division wasted the resources of the parliament."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arcane masters in the hall turned around and excitedly asked: "Really, Mr. Yurisian?" Some honestly salute: "Happy New Year, Mr. Yurisian."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s the seven-ring Ulysian who walked into the magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you don't believe me, you can go to the Magic Research Committee yourself." Yuris Ann smiled humorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the Arcanists have come back, some people are worried: "Our experimental plans are closely related to their own arcane research. · Will this leak out to inspire others?”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is very euphemistic, but the actual meaning is very clear, worried about being submitted from the experimental plan I saw the direction and foundation of my research, so I completed similar experiments ahead of time and snatched the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Reassure, all the experimental plans are backed up like papers, reviewed by members of the Magic Research Council, and don't worry about being stolen." Ulysian He smiled and answered that he was one of the best high-level magicians in the "Golden Moon Song League". He had a strong ability to work, so he entered the committee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yuris Ann smiled and said: "I don't know, this kind of thing is not so fast, but what is certain is that some legendary magicians and masters think that the observatory is unnecessary, they are not able to Research, some people think that it is not appropriate to build too many, this is a great pressure on the parliament's 'resource reserve'. In the Evian Observatory's 'Cosmic Observatory, you can't blindly promote it before it shows its own value."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, although there is a Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord of the Elements, Lord of the Storm, and other legendary magicians to support the 'Cosmic Observatory, · Estimated in a short time is the Tower. "Create another one."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Other lord's concerns are very reasonable. After all, no one knows. 'Cosmic Observatory, useful, rashly not a parliamentary style. "An arcane master agreed to the location.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as they were preparing to say goodbye to Ulysse, the reception desk in front of Julie suddenly sounded a toot. sound. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey?" Julie connected the wired phone. "Ah, "Arcane" and "Magic" have been sent?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arcane men who are ready to leave have stopped and patiently waited for ten minutes, then bought the "Arcane" and "Magic" journals from Julie. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This period of "Arcane" is really thick." An arcane teacher said a little doubt to his companion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysian did not go to his office to receive his own share, but looked at the journals on the reception desk that had not been sold. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quantum field theory? Lord Brooke, the storm dominates the Lord, and a series of papers by Lord Evans?" Some arcans quickly browsed through the catalogue and found out The keyword "quantum field theory". As soon as he heard his words, other arcans were even more surprised and confused: "Quantum self-sacrifice, field theory also knows, but what do they mean when they are together? Is that what you guess in your heart?"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theory of quantum field theory is complex and difficult, full of dizzying calculations. These arcians once again realize the sorrow of meeting general relativity and matrix mechanics, and some simply Skip the intermediate derivation process and familiarize yourself with the conclusions. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The essence of electromagnetic force?" An arcane teacher blurted out in amazement, and his voice was filled with sorrow and shock, as the four basic forces were One of the two most studied, the electromagnetic force has always been the basic composition of the world in the hearts of these songs of the Silver League, the closest to the real "things", when did the essence of electromagnetic force be given? Is this straight from jumping to running? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Among the four basic forces currently proposed, the strong interaction force (currently referred to as the nuclear force), although clear, may lack further research and even basic characteristics. They have not yet been mastered, let alone the theory of forming. The weak interaction force is only the conjecture put forward by Fernando. It has not been proved by other experiments. I don’t know when it is clear. Therefore, the essence of gravity is general relativity. After the initial interpretation, the essence of "electromagnetic force" is full of symbolic meaning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All along, the arcane masters who are good at electromagnetics have a lot of conjectures about the nature of electromagnetic force, but there has never been a complete and shaped theory, and today’s "Arcane" A series of papers seem to indicate a certain possibility of brain congestion! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ulysse is slowly reading the paper. The basis of the previous one is what he is good at, so there is no difficulty, but after hearing this exclamation, he also Turned to the back, looking at the essence of the electromagnetic force. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Electromagnetic force is an interaction realized by a series of reactions that exchange photons between charged objects? Virtual photons..." is quiet in the hall. I don't know how long it took, Yuris Ann said to himself, this conclusion has complete theoretical support, with a mathematical description of these simple or complex processes, whether correct or not, this is only since the discovery of electromagnetic force. One of the breakthroughs behind the Brooke equation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other arcane masters can only read and understand the conclusions. But even so, their eyes are full of shock and joy: "This is the electromagnetic force." "?<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can truly clear the electromagnetic force, then you will be able to gain unimaginable help from magicians who are good at electromagnetics! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" Three of you raised the problem of quantum field theory, because the infinity brought about by divergence should be solved?" An arcane master turned to the back, The original quantum field theory is still not perfect. There are still many problems to be solved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
