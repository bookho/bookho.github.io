			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Egret" area. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing through a low, dilapidated house, Buck took Heidi to a secluded and disrepaired place, where it was full of weeds, even It is daytime and horrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Here is occupied by a small number of tramps, but they have to run for life during the day, so they can't see the figure." Buck pointed at the crumbling wall. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing a few mud houses that would collapse at any time, Heidi saw the location of the crime on the photo, the sewage flowed, the fly flies, and the foul smells. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The tramps have no idea of ​​maintaining their own cleanliness, and the sewer entrance is nearby. They are still littering everywhere." Buck sighed, even if It is his detective who runs around and can't help but frown here, let alone the Arcanian of the atomic research institute of Ms. Heidi! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Heidi’s own areas of expertise are not in this respect, the arrangement of the Magic Council’s mandatory tasks has left her with no risky exercise, compared to the Ogre, Giant. The old nest of the monsters and other monsters, here is simply clean and refreshing like the garden of the noble lady, so I walked to the corner without frowning, and displayed a prophecy and a necromantic magic to detect clues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After a heavy rain yesterday, many traces were destroyed..." Heidi confirmed his guess from the magic feedback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck looked at her expectantly: "Yes, we are also faced with such distress, so we are looking for help from the Parliament. Do you have any means?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not use the full name of "Magic Council" to show that he is the standard pro-magic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the scene of the serious murder, Heidi did not swear, nor laughed and played, but took the bloody carcass of the victim very solemnly and displayed it. The five-ring magic of the star system is "like positioning". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass of flesh in her hand suddenly melted, falling on the ground, dragged by mysterious power, pointing to the distance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original can only locate living creatures. After improvement, as long as it does not exceed a certain time range, it can also be used to trace the 'trace' of the deceased, as long as The murderer also carries the internal organs, 'it' will lead us to the past." Heidi's left hand seems to have a layer of blood squirming. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck stunned to see this magical magic, once again firmly convinced his son to go to the general school to accept the basic magic education. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, replaced with Heidi to lead Buck, the two shuttled in the "Egret District", tracking the murderer's behavior. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, after a break, Heidi’s blood suddenly stopped boiling and twisted, like losing the last trace of vitality and fading away. , emitting rancid smell. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ms. What happened?" Buck asked worriedly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi looked around, and the baby’s face was very serious: “The connection between 'the same kind’ was deliberately cut off, and this must have enough Magic, magic or knight strength can be done."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What?" Buck was surprised that this serial murder against civilians would have a formal magician. What is the aristocratic knight involved? What are they doing? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi wrinkled his nose: "I asked before, why the murderer did not destroy the body, now it seems that they are not capable, but have something else. Purpose."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Other purposes?" Although Buck knows a lot of secret files, he still lacks "common sense" compared to Heidi, a senior magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi looked around and said casually: "In general, this strange situation is related to evil martial arts or cults, they are using ' "The internal organs", pay attention to the original body still exists..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then I submit the conclusion of your woman." Buck wants to back down, spread involved The kind of thing is that this policeman who only has the high-ranking knight's attendant strength can't bear it, let the knights at the top of the police department handle it, or go to the high-level magician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi's heart is quite excited. It is rare to have the opportunity to encounter evil magic rituals or cultists. He is eager to take out the magic crystal ball. It seems to be solemn and authentic: "I am not sure, I will confirm it again."<br />< Brt/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Rentt, she is not too worried about encountering enemies that she can’t deal with. The battles that exceed a certain intensity will be discovered by the Lord’s Palace, the Lord’s Headquarters. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transparent crystal ball becomes dark under the magical power, and then a little starlight illuminates, forming a light band with pointing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Going to the other side of the Egret area..." Heidi got feedback from astrology, but nothing happened. "Let's see it in the past."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck slightly distressed, but did not dare to refute, can only follow Heidi behind. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ms. Heidi belongs to a high-level magician and a legendary student. There must be no shortage of powerful items, even if they encounter evil magicians or cultists. Nothing..." With this thought, his heart gradually calmed down. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, he saw Heidi’s hand holding a silver badge with the symbol of the element, which seems to be the miniature of the periodic table. ——As the basic thing in the field of elements, even civilians know it. Many people even engrave it on their own door and think that it has the magical power to defend against evil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi snorted: "A medium for magical rituals."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Magic Ritual ......" According to Buck's shallow magical common sense, isn't this something that should be prepared in advance for a long time? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the conversation, along the path, the two came to the corner of the slum, where people came and went, it was quite lively. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it is a cultist, there must be a large number of people, which is consistent with more than one person, so we ask who often has a large number of strangers coming in, or regular The night is noisy, you should be able to find some clues." Buck gave advice to Heidi based on his own experience. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi smiled and said: "Then trouble Barker to detect you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In front of the low house, stood a wrinkled old woman, she was drying the washed clothes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hello, madam, I am a senior police detective from the Kingdom Police Department, I want to ask you a few questions." Buck politely lit up Document. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman was slightly sluggish and flustered: "Mr. Detective, you just ask."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp This kind of performance is generally seen when the poor people who have never seen the world encounter police detectives, so Buck nodded in secret: "You should be familiar with this street? Are there people who often have a lot of strangers? Or do you have a random name in the evening, so that everyone can't sleep?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman thought for a moment: "No, no notice, I rarely go to the street other Place."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck's good documents: "Do you know who knows this street?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Mr. Moro of the Black Brotherhood." The old woman whispered, seemingly equally afraid of Mr. Moro. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck nodded: "That took us to find him."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No, don't Mr. Detective, you are looking for someone else." The old woman waved her hand in a panic. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Barker compromise? Under his harsh statement, the old woman closed her door and took him and Heidi to the depths of this street. go with. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the low-rise houses on both sides of the street, women wash their clothes, men cut wood, and children look at strangers curiously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s really lively." Buck sighed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi frowned slightly, looked around and didn’t speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, while helping to knock on the door. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi suddenly said: "Today, we don’t visit Mr. Moro for the time being, we are in a hurry."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "What?" Buck was incomprehensible, and his heart suddenly sounded Heidi's voice. "Exit first, I will come by myself, otherwise I may not be able to take care of you."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;"Why?" Buck became nervous. Is this the legendary connection? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi didn’t smile with a smile: “The poor people in the slums need to work hard for more than ten hours a day to live, so during the day, there will only be Children and a small number of women, now, how many men are at home, what do they rely on to support themselves and their families?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buckton is sweating, I have been transferred to serve as a senior police detective. I have never had a grassroots experience in the past. Those ordinary police detectives who have changed their hands may have discovered problems, so he cooperated with Heidi: "Yes, I suddenly remembered us. There is also an urgent matter to return to the police station and come back to visit Mr. Moro tomorrow."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, have found problems, still want to go?" Two-story building There was a cold, hoarse voice, and the door was blown away by the wind, and the heavy bloody smell overflowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spacious hall, the organs of the heart, intestines, spleen, etc. are messy and strangely placed, not only bloody, but also rhythmic and bulging . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The surrounding men, women, and children all stood up, their mouths were completely split, revealing the entire pair of teeth, the tongue was full of barbs, and the eyes became scarlet and cold. It exudes a sinful and numb scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old woman standing next to it suddenly became dry, like a balloon being punctured, then swollen quickly, her eyes flushed, and a dull male voice : "I still want to go?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hand, and Buckton felt the real blackness condense at his fingertips, the horrible death of the pressure He was paralyzed and unable to move. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Death is a finger?" In the spiritual connection, Buck heard Heidi's voice. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black gas condenses, death is like acupuncture, Buck thinks numbly: "Will you die?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; At this time, he felt his body illusory, then became solid and appeared on the other side of the street. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This?" He was surprised to come back and found that Heidi had escaped with a magical attack. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, "Douglas's Spelling Absorbing Wall" highlights the red rays of the "split monsters". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not a high-level, how can you trigger?" The hoarse male voice blurted out in surprise, his old woman’s body could not bear the power The body collapsed and the meat and bones separated. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, many organs in the hall began to wriggle and gather together to form a quirky human form. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi snorted: "I am not a high-level player, but whoever can only use high-order triggers, this pre-stored spell is triggered according to specific circumstances. Magic, just in my research field, is a comprehensive application of the storage part, the control part, the arithmetic part, the information acquisition input part and the magic output part. I can't simplify everything, but I can simplify several of these modules with the help of items... maybe later, The five rings are high-level magicians!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She doesn't look worried at all, but her left hand keeps pressing on the silver badge, it seems to be one Set of complex caster gestures. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organ patched monster is angry and said: "I don't understand, but you don't want to live! Can you use other high-level magic?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is about to finish his body, and those "cracked monsters" are blocking the streets densely, and the magical power that rises in the dark interferes with the flight. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling the attention of the pair of red-eyed eyes, Buck scared his legs slightly, and he could only pin his hopes on Heidi. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
