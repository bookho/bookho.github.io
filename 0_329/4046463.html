			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the window is a rapidly retreating lush field and lush forest, underneath is a smooth "steel monster", in front of a delicate and delicious black pepper steak, Louise It’s a dream like a dream. After a long and difficult trek to reach the Kingdom of Holm, everything I saw was so shocking and shocking, so incredible! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apprentices can perform magic on the street without worrying about church interference; the train platform is built in the city and can be seen by ordinary people coming and going; Sharp whistle sound, can hold hundreds of people's behemoths, can run so fast, so smooth, this high-level alchemy items that only high-level magicians can enjoy can actually use a ring mage and apprentices Allen's common sense and fun are different from the ancient magical empire described in the book, which is a paradise and abyss...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If not in Padre The ordinary citizens of the Holm Kingdom that Hong Kong has seen are not only different from the style of the conservative, but no different from the people of the Vaolirit Principality. Louise will surely think that he has come to a new world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, this is the new world, and my life has opened a new page! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louise touched his waterfall-like black long hair, and he was determined to be strong and yearning. She is a common aristocratic family, and her family has secretly passed on generations of magic, so that those who can not stimulate the blood of the Cavaliers learn. In this way, it is only possible to deploy a medicinal agent that stimulates blood vessels according to the secret equation, to ensure that the family's knights are “permanently eternal” and their status is steadily improved. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the safer measures are no match for the fate of the arrangement, their family was called to participate in a recent war against the heresy of the North, most of the male surnames were killed in On the battlefield, the female surname was married to the outside, and the remarriage was remarried. Only her grandfather and her only a few years old were left. Therefore, distant relatives began to look at the title and property. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case that she could not motivate her own blood, she had to choose the inheritance of magic, and learn magic with a magician who was recruited by Grandpa. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magical world is so colorful, profound and profound that it has deeply attracted her. It can only be a life of fear, and must always cover up its own whereabouts like a mouse until She accidentally discovered that the famous musician Silvia was an apprentice known as "White Honey", which had the intention of covering up her magic apprenticeship with a fairly good musical talent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, she inherited the family heritage and secret materials, exchanged silver moon pharmacy from the teacher with secret materials, and promoted to the official mage level. In order to cover up the magician's spiritual fluctuations, she exchanged the savings of most of the heritage and musical performances with the holy water, which inspired the blood of the indulgent animals and became a new musician. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all this still can’t satisfy her, especially the fact that the teacher was killed by the night watchman when she explored the remains in the Black Forest, which often made her wake up in the middle of the night, very afraid On that day, the night watchman appeared in his room, so she worked hard to learn, desperately to create music, hope that the reputation is louder, get to know more big aristocrats, get their blessing. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My request is not excessive, just want to live quietly and study magic, but it seems that I can never be satisfied." Midnight dreams, she always This kind of lament will be issued, and at this moment, the arrival of "Professor" opened the door to a new world, let her see hope, the only regret is to say goodbye to the favorite music, bid farewell to the Aalto Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Louise?" The puzzled voice of the young wizard opposite Louise awakened Louise from his memories. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louise softly smiled and said: "Sorry, shocked by the magic steam train, recalling some things, Mr. Pan, please continue to talk about the most stupid Ariel Deadly rankings, this is both interesting and inspiring."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound is sweet and moving, the temperament is fresh and gentle with a touch of melancholy, this is the majority of women The surname magician does not have it. Their appearance is better than Louise's, or knowing the surname, or elegant, or charming, but there is little Louise's artistic temperament. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next black hair tidy upside down, Klein also smiled and said: "Mr. Pan, I really didn’t think that magic experiment, exploration and life would happen so much. Stupid things, huh, I have to work hard to avoid, to prevent similar mistakes from happening one day, and to be laughed at by the magicians after death."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the talk was the obvious group of Louise, Klein, "Flame" Zapatero and the "hanging" Ricardo who saw the city of Heidele, the apprentices of the Allinge circle did not have On the way, some died on the way, and finally there were only two magicians and two apprentices who arrived in Stourke. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Stewart only sent magicians and selected apprentices, but the hanged and the flames depended on the sage’s sentiments, disguised as his apprentices, and together Sent over. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, are you coming to Allinge?" Louise looked out the window and couldn't seem to see the shadow of the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan smiled and said: "On the cloud, you can't see it directly."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Nodded, Louise took his eyes and hesitated. He smiled and asked, "Mr. Pan, can you ask me something?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Louise Don't be so polite, call me Pan, what?" Pan quietly changed his name. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Louise did not know why he asked a little nervously: "Pan, do you know that there is a code in the parliament called 'Professor'?" Can be mounted on the purification sequence, this The code name should be more famous in Allinge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes of the sage, the hanged, and so on are instantly concentrated on Pan. The only thing they are familiar with in Parliament is the "Professor". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr. 'Professor', he was famous for boarding the purification sequence, belonging to the 'Elemental Will' organization I just mentioned, but most of the magicians I don't know his true identity, I don't know who he is." Pan shook his head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein and others were a little disappointed: "Have you guessed who?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Pan Gang wants to answer, the apprentices along the way suddenly burst into exclamation, Klein and others followed and turned to look out the window, I saw the rails floating up, the train was flying in the air, in the fields, forests and cities below. It is getting smaller and smaller, like a dense ant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is a miracle..." Klein was immersed in the church in Alto for a long time, and his mouth was a "miracle", not far away. Half of the peaks in the air, the towers of magic, the bright gardens, the dense woods, and the wide city seem to be described as "miracle." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allinge welcomes you." Pan left his hand and leaned over and bowed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Louise’s eyes whispered in confusion: “Is this Aringe...”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fill out Good advice, under the magic steam train, Pan led everyone to take the carriage to the headquarters. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While watching the street scene, from time to time marveling at all kinds of strange alchemy items, non-human races, the group quickly arrived at the Allinge Magic Tower and suffered a Losper's "noise pollution". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Alchemy life is amazing...he turned out to be like..." Louise resisted not saying the word "salty", although she was smug Prosper had a few words, but still like the country's smashing into the city. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When you upgrade to the ranks, you can refine your alchemy life with your own magic tower." Pan smiled and looked forward to a bright future, even if he knew it. The Sixth Ring is a vain dream for most low-level magicians. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Higher level..." Klein and others followed with a sigh of relief, which means that life is greatly extended, meaning all kinds of powerful means, even meaning The possibility of replacing young flesh. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan took a look at Louise’s feet and looked around at the white wolf in the silver hall: “Louise, your magical pet is really a spiritual surname, it’s better to bring it. Go to the mission area and apply for 'breeding experiments'. I believe that those who study blood, deformation, and magic pets will be happy to accept them, and you can also get precious arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp Louise didn't think that this kind of thing could be talked about in a bright and straightforward way. Sometime it was blushing: "In Aringe, these large animals will be castrated to prevent damage when they are estrus..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
