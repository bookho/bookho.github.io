			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holy City of Lans, the Great Hall of Light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the "Glory of God" Beria, "Four Wings" Shidong, "Lighting Tomorrow" Fei Libei, who are not allowed to leave the fortress, The other members of the Cardinal Bishops were all gathered together, and many legends exuded the physical repression, allowing the magnificent hall to be filled with a solid atmosphere. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope, the Magic Council has gone further and further in the field of spying on God, we can no longer hesitate, fear, and must be true in them. They were completely eliminated before they grew up.” Another giant of the referee, “The Guard of Light,” Azallo broke the scene of quietness and repression, and once again expressed his strong desire to fight against the Magic Council. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pope Benedict II took the scepter, listened quietly to his request, and then saw the Cardinal Sald, the church of Vaolirit come out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Pope, the new particle was discovered to be a subversion of theological atomic problem, and has nothing to do with the teachings of the Holy Scriptures, and for this, many times The theological conferences are actually controversial. They have no serious influence on the believers, the bottom priests, and most of the bishops and cardinals. They can only show that the past few popes have misunderstood the doctrine, without prejudice to the glory of the Lord, and the Pope will drop you. The majesty."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salde is quietly like a lake of water, seemingly clear but deep and difficult to see through, the sound is flat, not anxious, give The feeling of spring breeze. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"" His Majesty the Pope, Thrall said it makes sense. Since the transformation of theology by His Majesty the Pope, it has not been adjusted according to the results of the Magic Council's exploration of the world. Modifications? There have been many such incidents in the past. Most of the clergy have become accustomed to our approaching to the Lord. Why are we going to be reckless and unprepared in this situation? Just because of the losses caused by our own radical conservatives?” Another cardinal, “The Angel of the Wind,” Estella, followed Saarde’s opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the speech of both of them, many cardinals are secretive in the heart, two old foxes! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, several popes have been adjusting theology based on the latest theory of arcane, similar to the new particle, which has been found in the first two or three hundred years. It will be faced once in a few decades, and the impact will not be too great. It should be used to it beforehand. There is no need to make a big move and let other enemies who are in sight of it sneak into the air. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gradual decline of the majesty of the pope in the clergy is due to the repeated transformation of theology! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discovery of new particles is a devastating glory for the gods, but a great blow to the image of the pope. Isn’t it the only spokesperson who claims to be the god on earth? Is it not possible to communicate with the Lord and convey the will of the Lord? Why explain the wrong teachings again and again? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of the performance of Sald and Estila’s swearing words, many cardinals have bowed their heads, no rebuttal, and can stand in the Great Hall of Light. No one is stupid than anyone else. What you say depends only on what position you stand on, what you want to get, not what it actually is. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weakening of the patriarchal image of the Pope’s majesty, who has the greatest benefit? There is no doubt that the Cardinal Mission! Just like the church in the north! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are a lot of members of the cardinal group standing on the side of the pope, so they have stood up and said that they did not start the war before because they were focused on the church in the north, so they let The strength of the Magic Council has swelled and it is no longer possible to make previous mistakes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the dispute reached a peak, the Pope lifted the scepter and said in a majestic manner: "Things have already happened. What needs to be done now is to adjust theological content as soon as possible so that it is absolutely great." Some clergy will not be bothered by this. At the same time, strengthen the oppression of the Magic Council, strengthen the shift of the center of gravity, and give them a heavy blow when the opportunity arises."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Neither blindly started the war, nor did it stand out from the crowd. The Pope compromised the views of both sides. However, this also surprised the Pope's supporters. In the history of the church, the number of wars actually fighting to maintain the glory of the Lord is not too much. The Pope's conquests to maintain their authority are everywhere, such as a few A hundred years of church war between the North and the South. Can he be patient with Benedict II? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement of the decision, the Pope’s mouth hangs a faint smile, and I have a deep look at Sald and Estila. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pope Benedict II gently squeezed the jaw: "This matter is handed over to Philippe Bell for their completion."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a slight look at the Pope’s look The eyes of Thrad stood up again: "His Majesty, we must pay attention to the situation of the priests in the Kingdom of Holm, and the emergence of this radical retro-styled Andrade is by no means an accident, fully demonstrating the interior of the Holm parish clerics There have been similar trends of thought, and failure to deal with them in time may have serious consequences."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This incident allowed Valen Hill and Baha'u'llah to solve They are all members of the Cardinal Mission, and they have the ability to deal with devout faith.” Benedict II is calm enough to suspect that he will never be angry, anxious, and so on. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valen Hill is one of the leaders of the monks and is the representative of the most honest believers. Bahá'u'llah is the referee giant, titled "Judge", both Of course, the candidates who deal with similar events, even if they are not in the Holm parish, will be transferred to them. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............The Kingdom of Holm, the Glorious Cathedral. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filibel received the command of the Holy City Lance and the revised theological content. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Delete the section of the atomic holy surname, adding the content that the Lord created many elementary particles to form the world, emphasizing that the Lord is the first cause, the first promoter, After creating the world, human beings and all things, it does not directly affect the functioning of the world, but guides the world's development and the elimination of evil through miracles and trials." Philip Belle calmly revisited the theology to Bahá'u'lláh. , Warren Hill, Shi Dong, three cardinal members listen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallen Hill maintains the sad face of the monk: "Has the glory of the Lord been degraded to this point?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church faces the aggressiveness of the Magic Council, not just a dull response, but through a variety of theological conferences, exploring the direction of theological changes, once the impact of new particles, can be from the previous theology New explanations were found in the conference materials, and the fastest time weakened the impact. Because these theological contents themselves were proposed by saints, cardinals, cardinals, and bishops and priests with theological potential, they were easily accepted by the clergy and later went wrong. It also allows the pope to get rid of most of the relationship. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of this revision was put forward at several previous theological conferences. The members of the Cardinal Mission are aware that Wallen Hill is quite opposed to this. I think that the authority of the Lord has been weakened a lot, and I still have to watch it become part of formal theology. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;——This doctrine believes that everything is full of causal connections, and the original cause is the Lord, called the first cause, and the laws of the world are explored to the end. There will always be a beginning, a driving force, and the Lord is the first promoter. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After reading the document, the "four-winged knight" Shidong was slightly disappointed and angry: "Continue to wait for the opportunity? We don't do anything? Once We must be patient with the provocation of the Magic Council. Are we still the guards of the Lord?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if they now think it is a serious loss caused by radical conservatives It has nothing to do with the subjective will of the Magic Council, but does not prevent them from believing that discovering new particles is a provocation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairbell showed a smile: "This information was caused by accidental leakage, which caused our clergy to be damaged. In turn, it also shows that the Magic Council has not yet Being prepared should still be at the stage of transforming the magician's atomic position. Therefore, since the cardinal and bishops who are totally unacceptable within this fact have either been swallowed up by the Holy Light or shaken the trust of doctrine and theology, it is difficult to Going forward, why don't we directly spread the experiment of new particles, know that many middle and high-level magicians have a firmer position on atomism than our bishops."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor, the general pastor, etc. are still at the stage of learning theology, and the impact is not too great. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, anyway, our losses will not be more, and it will be a very good thing to cause a serious blow to the Magic Council." Baha'u'llah agrees Philip Bell's opinion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it’s too weird, weird, and funny to have the priests and bishops “spread” the new arcane theory to the magician? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it reversed? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
