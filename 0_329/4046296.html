			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frantz’s body is not healthy, and there are often inspirational expressions, creative passions, and illnesses, so he understands the road well. Sean Road: "Mr. Evans, I understand your current status, I will accompany you to complete the song."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then his thin face A sincere smile: "After hearing the melody of the song popped up with the piano and learning that it is just a chorus of the fourth movement of the symphony, I can already imagine its beauty, sacredness, majesty and shock, and this is the first Introducing a vocal chorus in a symphony is a revolution in creating a surname!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be able to contribute to such a great musical creation to help Evans Mr. You complete it, it is my glory, the memory that I can relive after I am old."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to modify the long poems to conform to this world lingua franca Rhythmic beauty, in order to get rid of the words that may be blasphemy, in order to be different in words Under conditions of the original melody wedge bonding, and Franz Lucien had the good musician writing poetry and songs repeatedly discuss the amendment, both sides spent a lot of energy to complete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Franz is a person who loves music wholeheartedly and worships Lucien very much, so after learning all the ideas and hearing the melody of the chorus, Do not hesitate to praise. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cough and cough, thank you Franz for your cooperation during this time, our work is nearing completion, and the next step is through the practice of lead singers and choirs. Look at what else is there. Do you think the difficulty is too high?" Lucien deliberately coughed and cried, then asked with a mentally excited attitude. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French shook his head firmly: "The difficulty is really big, but modifying some of the paragraphs makes them easy and loses the original perfection. I want to be excellent." The band and the singer can do this."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think so too." Lucien and Franz smiled. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, the door of the piano room was gently ringed, then the handle slowly rotated, and the person quietly pushed open the door - he seemed afraid of bothering Discuss and practice with people inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lusien, Franz, are you not discussing?" The person who came in was Victor, the piano room on the fourth floor of the Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled and replied: "Victor teacher, we have just finished."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I It’s time to come, first of all, to congratulate Lucien for completing this symphony that I can’t wait to appreciate, and then to introduce you to a friend.” Victor pointed to the young man who came in with him, “The famous singer’s law. Mr. Brini, who is also the lead singer of the Golden Cathedral choir.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of the song "Ode to Joy", Lucien asked Victor to help him find An excellent singer and a great choir or choir. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fabrini is about twenty years old, his eyes are blue, his blondes are bright, his hair is beautiful, like an angel who serves the god of truth, but with most men Different, his face painted with a touch of makeup, lips rosy, gorgeous clothes, giving a strange enchanting feeling. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hello, Mr. Evans. I have always liked your music and I don't think there will be a chance to work with you." Fabrini's voice is pure and soft. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien is not surprised by Fabrini's appearance and temperament, because most of the outstanding singers are singers, and he is still golden The lead singer of the cathedral, then smiled: "I am very glad to meet you, Mr. Fabriini, I hope that our next cooperation is enjoyable."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Fabri Nie, Lucien did not deliberately make a non-discriminatory attitude, because in terms of the current social atmosphere, the singer is very popular. A female count in the Gusta Empire madly liked their songs and once launched a war for a singer. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mr. Evans, I will go to the concert hall with a choir to wait for you. Yes, your face is not very good, pay attention to your body." Fabri The Nepalese language is soft and gentle, it seems that he usually speaks like this. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the arrival of Fabrini, Lucien "cracked" and coughed hard, seemingly coughing out the entire internal organs. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien shook his head "firmly": "It doesn't matter, Teacher Victor, just a little residual injury, will not affect the preparation of the concert, I am a knight."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;####################################################################################################### Don't worry. Wait until the evening, I will ask the doctor of Shantang to show you, don't wait for the incurable troubles after the concert."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" Ok, thank you, Victor.” Hearing the doctor who was just a good teacher, Lucien didn’t refuse, he can now control the heartbeat, blood flow rate and visceral squirming, not to mention some of the techniques Natasha taught. It can completely pretend to be a symptom of a lingering but not life-threatening condition. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............A week later, the month of flowers is near mid-term. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditorium on the fifth floor of the Aalto Musicians Association. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fabry, how many times have you been? Why do you have problems in this paragraph?" Lucien’s emotions growled a little out of control. Fabrini in the center of the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fabrini looked at the tired and irritated Lucian, very wronged to explain: "Mr. Evans, the difficulty of these paragraphs is really It’s too big, it needs to be practiced repeatedly to sing it perfectly.” There seems to be a glittering tear in his blue eyes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But we have practiced it many times!" Lucien waved his arm hard. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fabrini made a few deep breaths and resolutely resisted the "tyrant": "Not enough, Mr. Evans, or you give me more time, Either modify these paragraphs to make them simpler."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! I can't modify it, I can't stand the perfection of their destruction! Fabrini, please You work harder, I believe that you will be able to perform perfectly! Time will be delayed a few days according to your suggestion, cough and cough, hope not to be too long..." Lucien "mad" said, but immediately fell into A severe cough, bent over and squatting in front of the stage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Front on the side quickly rushed to help Lucien, Fabrini also scared a little panic and ran to Lucien, gently patted His back: "Mr. Evans, you can rest assured that I will master these paragraphs as quickly as possible."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the rehearsal is over, wear Fabrini, a black shirt with a gold silk pattern, stepped off the stage. Halfway through, he suddenly turned back inexplicably and looked at the front of the stage. It seemed that there was still a madness and anxious appearance. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe at that time, Mr. Evans had already felt something, so it seemed so urgent, so harsh, not as quiet and calm as the rumors, courtesy and gentle A few years later, when Fabriyi recalled that the concert had impressed him the most, he was a little fatalistic and wrote something like this with a little emotion. "He is showing such concentration, that kind of effort, Such madness seems to be the most splendid and most brilliant light without regret. I received the gift of the Lord, and I was fortunate to know Mr. Evans at this time and to complete the rehearsal and performance of this symphony with him. He witnessed his different aspects and his devotion to music and to the Lord."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............Lusien met in the town of Massawa The businessman, Greenton, returned to the north after leaving Aalto and went to the ancient kingdom of Syria. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the goods were all sold out and they were ready to buy the specialties of the Syracuse Kingdom to the Fortress of the Dark Mountain in the Vaurit, he bought it at the local musicians association. The previous issue of "Music Review" and "symphony guide". <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While eating a greasy breakfast, Greenton looked at the newspaper and suddenly his knife and fork cutting the mignon suddenly slammed, his eyes wide, not I dared to read it again and again, and then rejoiced and annoyed: "I didn't expect that I just left Aalto, and Mr. Evans ended his trip and returned..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May Twenty-six, the Hall of the Holy Ghost, returning to the concert... Do you want to go? From here to Aalto, it’s about sixteen days.”<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greenton It is a large city near the border between the Kingdom of Syracuse and the Principality of Vaolirit, and it is currently 15 May. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
