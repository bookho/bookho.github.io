			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is a hypothesis made specifically to explain the photoelectric effect. It does not have the universal surname that normal theory should have. It cannot be used to explain other light. The phenomenon is even completely contradictory to the diffraction image. At the same time, there is no precise experiment to confirm this theory. People have to doubt that it is always a hypothesis, a hypothesis that is rigorous, concise, and wonderful, but not in line with the real situation. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Similar hypothesis, the Arcanists have done a lot, but when it does not have a universal surname, it cannot be used to explain other phenomena, often It means that the direction of the hypothesis is wrong. I have the same opinion for this paper."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I believe that Mr. Lucian Evans himself has similar The view, understanding the contradiction between this theory and Brooke's electromagnetic system, and the contradiction between many classical optical patterns, so finally compromised to add a discourse, affirming that this is only the processing of instantaneous values, in terms of the whole situation, the wave Special "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roland is more annoyed when writing, if not for the storm to dominate, consider that Lucien is the same audit committee as himself, taking into account his honor and arcane The status of the standard, he imagined that Nesika and other people scolded Levsky for direct personal attacks on Lucien, let him be awake, do not immerse in the quantum of the absurd dreams, open your eyes and look at the stability And a perfect arcane system. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, Roland once again wrote: "And this assumption similar to the particle theory variant is still ridiculous from the perspective of energy discontinuity. Even the Arcanist who supports Particle Theory will not agree with it. Of course, Mr. Lucian Evans fully elaborated his own ideas and gave us a lot of inspiration, at least let the photoelectric effect get a 'temporary 'The perfect explanation, so my assessment result is:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A paper with considerable discussion value and only discussion value for the time being, etc. After the result, you can apply to modify the evaluation results. Currently, you are recommended to reward one Arcane score and five Arcane points. '"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final summary, Roland is very careful Oh, don't dare to be too exposed, after all, Lucien? Evans is not an arcane master who has no backstage and status. He is caught by the handle and it is easy to lose the position of the audit committee. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why this paper was passed is because there are still some supporters in particle theory, if you grasp particle theory and Brooke electromagnetic system, classic optical patterns The contradictions directly returned to these papers, and the reviewers who supported the particle theory would return all the papers that did not conform to Douglas's speed of light experiment and photoelectric effect, and Roland had to compromise to some extent, enduring disgust. A variant of particle theory—although wave theory has dominated, particle theory is still tough, and there is no failure to acknowledge it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing the results of the review, Roland took a pipe and took a sip, then sneered: "Whether you want to be seen by other arcaneists, this paper, I decided to recommend it to Drummond and let him post it on "Arcane" as an article about the semi-discussion. Lucien Evans, ready to accept criticism and attacks from thousands of arcaneists? ""<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The energy sub-hypothesis is because there is no other theoretical explanation for the time being, so there are not many arcists writing paper rebuttals, they can only be forgotten, and this The time is completely different, you dare to go directly to one of the two arcane systems, which is the enemy of most arcane masters! There are classic theories, there are experimental images, I don't believe no one speaks!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After spreading the paper, writing a letter of recommendation to Drummond and putting it away, Roland stood up and walked in the study with his hands, whispering Self-speaking: "The best way is to use the experimental results and images to refute it. It will be evidence of the surname, not left to the road. En? Evans has any opportunity to justify his weakness and powerlessness in front of all the Arcans."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Silver Moon Alliance is located in the division of Allinge, a peculiar middle-aged man is reviewing the paper. He has a lot of tattoos in the shape of an electric arc. The tiny electric current on the elliptical bald head makes him feel like a long, silvery white hair. His eyes are slightly picked up, and there are electric escaping from time to time. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Luthian? Evans finally exposed his identity as a particle theory supporter? Or does he want to promote his quantum theory? "The seven-level Arcanist and the eight-ring magician Teixeira’s mouth showed a mocking smile. "However, no matter what his purpose is, his paper is worthless in explaining the photoelectric effect. It must be Simply to explain the photoelectric effect and ignore the results of other theories, hey, he can only make it when the exact experiment can not be carried out, otherwise he would have to be exploded by the experimental image."<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teixeira wrote the written content of the self-speaking words on the paper, and finally wrote: "...It is undeniable that it has certain discussion value, which provides direction and inspiration for us to explain the photoelectric effect, suggesting rewards. There are two arcane points and six arcane points."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had no preconceptions about Lucien, but now he is standing on particle theory, quantum It is assumed that the angle attacks the electromagnetic system based on its own cognition and is full of disgust. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it wasn’t for Lucian’s many achievements, the magical power would improve, and he would doubt whether Lucien’s true arcane level was as horrible as rumors. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put down the quill, Teixeira looks at the photoelectric effect, which is the phenomenon that has recently plagued him. He looked at it and he couldn’t help but wrinkle it. Brow: "If you take the assumption of Lucien Evans, the photoelectric effect seems to have a reasonable explanation, and it is quite in line with the simple, intuitive and wonderful pursuit of the Arcane results."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why is this so? A hypothesis that is completely inconsistent with the classic image, but can explain the photoelectric effect that contradicts the fluctuation theory?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... ...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwilling to see Brooke and his students and supporters arrogant Alti尓 settled in their home town, the black minaret is the most attractive building in the entire town The people who come and go are full of awe. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the magic tower study, the expression on Altty’s face has changed from anger and disgust to appreciation and ecstasy:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haha, light quantum, light quantum, don't think that I have changed a word to describe me, I don't know you! What is the difference between this and the photon that the particle theory looks for? One copy, there is a minimum limit, not "Particles?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Quantization of light is not another elaboration of particle theory? And the introduction of frequency and the assumption of individual photon energy, photoelectric effect I got a perfect explanation. Haha, Lucien Evans is the best genius of this generation of arcane masters. I will be the most promising one in the future!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prophecy of Lucine’s previous artificial planet helped Douglas lay its own theoretical foundation, and this time the light quantum hypothesis is clearly standing in the perspective of particle theory, so Altty began to refer to him as confidant. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would like to see what the idiots who support the volatility say to overthrow this explanation? Are their classic theories and images useful in the photoelectric effect?" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alti 尓 尓 尓 尓 尓 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔 阿尔Well, let's announce it. If there is no other explanation in a year, the 50,000 Arcane points will be returned to Sin? Evans! I really want to give it to him now!"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sorting out the papers and sending them to Drummond, Alti尓 thought happily: "From the perspective of particle theory, Lucien’s previous energy hypothesis seems not so difficult. Accept, I was blinded by the experience of the past..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp;Sorcerer Management, Eric received the results of the Lucian paper. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He repeatedly witnessed Lucien’s subversion of his surname or new achievements, curiously flipping through the documents, his face became sturdy, and he was also a staunch supporter of the volatility. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the paper and looking at the descriptions of the two members, Eric wants to write something to refute Lucien’s light quantum hypothesis. Suddenly, he thought of the periodic table of things. At that time, Lucien’s paper seemed to have received a very low evaluation, but later it was confirmed by accurately predicting the discovery of new elements, and the two members admit their mistakes. Re-giving a very high rating. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are also many hypotheses based on light quantum in this paper... Is it..." The past experience buried the seeds of doubt in Eric’s heart, "still Let's discuss the problem with an exact experiment..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Roland Intentionally revealed that although there are still two or three weeks from the next issue of "Arcane" release, Lucien proposed the light quantum hypothesis, and the explanation of the photoelectric effect from the perspective of particle theory soon spread. The Arcanist exchanged this paper for reading, but most of them are like Eric. Because of Lucy’s past glory and correctness, he dared not directly write a paper rebuttal, fearing that he would throw accurate experimental results. Faces, when the impact is huge, I am afraid I will burst my head. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
