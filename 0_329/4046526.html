			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night in the mountains is extremely cold, the heat of the rainy season seems to have disappeared temporarily, and a strand of whirlwind wind blows into the cave, boasting to Lucien and Na Tasha's face brings a long-lost refreshment. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Natasha looked curiously at Lucian to unfold the special parchment paper, open the magic array, light the crystal light, and then lift the feather pen. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hasn’t seen an artisan writing a paper, but she has never heard of an arcian who can do this in such an environment and in such dangers. Writing a thesis to increase the level of materiality in the cognitive world, Lucien can always subvert people's common sense. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holding your breath, Natasha saw Lucien writing the paper and began writing the text:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "This paper is based on the principle of relative surname and the principle of constant speed of light. For this, I stipulate the following:"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;嗷呜! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the beasts screamed and screamed, and there was a shudder from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha was a little shocked and then laughed at herself: "The night falls, and it’s time for beasts and monsters to move."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has long listened to the "voice of mystery" privately broadcasted by Sean, and has accumulated many new words and new sentences. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since self-deprecating, she reported to try to be curious and began to look at Lucien for derivation, trying to try to understand how much she can understand. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a short period of hardship, Lucien went into the wind, and a strip of style flowed out from the pen, seeing Natasha’s two beautiful silver-purple eyes After a circle of dizziness, he shook his head and looked up. He looked at Lucien's serious face, and his well-defined side face exudes an indescribable charm under the light. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha held her right hand in her left hand, her right hand subconsciously rubbed her chin, and she was very attentive. She shook her head from time to time: "Unfortunately, unfortunately..." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the lively green oasis of the eastern desert, floating like a statue The building of the heavenly palace. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The largest of the buildings is a church with a cross, and there is a simple study behind the church. In the study, Pope Benedict II, the old man Wearing a soft hat and looking at the information returned from various places, from time to time, I took a cup of white glazed porcelain and drank a cup of black tea. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, Benedict II’s right hand shook gently, and the white glazed porcelain cup quickly fell to the ground, just as it would be broken, but it was like being caught by the wind. Fly back to the hands of Benedict II. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benedict II two white eyebrows wrinkled slightly, put down the teacup, went to the window, looked at the starry night sky outside the window, the heart's instigation for a long time can not calm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where is there something big happening?" He is a kind of power-level powerhouse who can't miss the cup without a reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mood slowly calmed down, the pope took out his scepter, whispered and asked "the god." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no answer? Is it Aitna and his struggle?" Benedict II said suspiciously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The east side of the stormy sea, several houses have been set up by the sea A pointed magic tower. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the magic towers, Douglas and the temporarily unsuccessful storm dominated, Hathaway discussed recent issues, Oliver and the soul of the dead went deep into the East. The swamp of the face, killing a legendary pseudo-god. The pseudo-god itself is a black dragon close to the legend. Later, I did not know why it was worshipped by people and other Yalong races. It was gradually infected by the power of faith. It was actually promoted to the legend, claiming to be the "Dark Dragon God" and the world. There is no legendary powerhouse at present. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm dominated and didn't have a good cough and coughed. The mouth was hard and said: "Why should I worry? Lu Xien is so secret in this kid, I don't know how many experiments and research results are hidden, and it is right to not harm others." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heatheri said in a simple and concise manner: "If there is no conspiracy behind this incident, Lucien is basically not in danger."<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fully affirmed the strength and flexibility of Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If there is a conspiracy..." Fernando glared at his red eyes and gritted his teeth, surrounded by squally winds, thunder and lightning, and terrible. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happened quite coincidentally, and in the eyes of the clever figure of the Arcanist, it was natural to see some clues, with preliminary speculation. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the conversation, Douglas moved in the heart and looked out the window. He saw a round of red dragonfly rising slowly at the seaside, and Xiaguang dyed the seawater with a bright red. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a beautiful and moving landscape, and Douglas suddenly had a feeling that the sea turned into a demon, and that a large piece of red was like countless blood. Converging, it makes people feel heartbroken and fearful. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What happened?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good, not good..."< Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas in his field of stellar and force fields is no worse than prophecy in prophecy and horoscope. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fernando and Hathaway looked at the window at the same time, there was no hunch, but at the same time there was a feeling of repression and comfort. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;............<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha quietly watched Lucien writing a paper, not only Without impatience and impatience, she was quite self-satisfied. When she looked at it, she looked around in confusion. She said to herself: "How can there be an illusion of time and space change?"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The papers written by Lucien are getting more and more, combing and recognizing the research results in the past three years, and taking a crucial step in feedback. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cognitive world begins to appear like a virtual reality, and the fast-moving stars, the strange rays, the elements that split the radiation and the particle flow all have wonderful changes. As if the time of the quiet flow, not changed by everything, the river suddenly lost its reading power, absolute surname, and material, energy, and space entangled, regardless of each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silent roar rang in Lucian’s cognitive world, inexplicably shocking the storm of terror, the spatial structure and time of the entire cognitive world completely deviated from Douglas The description of absolute time and absolute space under the dual system of Brooke is closer to reality, like a complete world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The semi-substantial cognitive world that has space and time changes rapidly, and illusion seems to evolve into reality. When the derivation of the theory of relativity is approaching completion, Lucy En's cognitive world is completely substantive! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not stop, and then the previous content began to derive the formula for the quality. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn’t take long, the derivation was completed, Lucien took a deep breath, and the feather pen fell, giving the final formula:<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"E=mc^2."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang, this formula full of simplicity and classic beauty just appeared on the paper, Lucy Encognition of the elements in the world, the light spots split and aggregate, exploding the horrible energy, and shrinking the projections of other worlds to the edge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang, as soon as it seems to contain a simple formula of endless mystery, Natasha feels that it has cast a layer of ruined color and vigorous power. But she waited to look at it carefully, but there was no more feeling before. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang, a mushroom cloud rises out in the elemental change, which seems to contain an extremely complex and incomplete model. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang, Natasha inexplicable, turned and looked at the night outside the cave, in the sky, a illusory hot sun suddenly emerged, just screaming again and again The beasts and monsters are all quiet and silent, dead and silent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
