			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment when the "painful devil" disappeared, the bleak hall that was still heavily suppressed under the glory of the "Glory Crown" was like being washed by water. Restored to soft and bright. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Win!" Sophia looked at the mysterious magician in front of him, cheering and clenching his fists, and seemed to never have to worry about twisting the horrible Painful" devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, her brain is spinning fast and she begins to consider what conditions can be used to impress each other. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Lucien did not relax a bit, holding the "pale justice" in both hands, watching the aristocratic children who were still alive in the hall, and concentrated their energy. On the "Ice and Snow Medal", "silent hail" is on the verge. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of whether they are "abomination" or "greed", their sorrows and deaths have left a deep impression on Lucien, "pain" should also No exception, maybe if you are happy with victory, when it is easy to be safe, which aristocratic child's face will show a painful smile. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to common sense, the best way is to kill all the living things outside of yourself, so that "pain" does not occupy the new body. It will gradually disappear, but this is the seven most mysterious and strangest devils, and it is related to negative emotions. If you are immersed in the desire to kill for the sake of safety, then the "pain" or "indulgence" of the devil may not be occupied. It’s your own! In this way, the trouble becomes very large, and it is many times more difficult than dealing with the external "projection"! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gaze swept through each of the surviving aristocratic children and stayed on them for a moment, the coldness in their eyes made them involuntarily shudder, panic and fear to fall backwards I dare not move half a step. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking around the small half of the hall, the line of sight fell on Sophia’s face. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the heart was also stopped by the deep and indifferent eyelids, Sophia, who was already mentally prepared, quickly kept himself in the basics. Calm, a sweet and charming smile on his face, lips open, you must express the meaning of surrender and communicate, as long as the other party to open the conditions, no matter what, there is room for change. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is actually quite confident, because after thinking about it, she found that she and the mysterious magician actually have no hatred, and there is no interest in entanglement. The treasure of the Sun King can give him all The secret can be left to him to ruin, he does not look at it at all, the position of the heirs of the gorse family, he has no possibility of getting it, can not talk about the obstacles, and his attempt to kill the "Bolaq" plan has not yet begun. It has been broken and has not caused any substantial damage. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, living alive can also give him something that he can’t get in the underground palace, such as the secrets of the royal family, such as the ancient precious literature collected before, such as enough Most of the Earl's red-eyed wealth, such as his own flesh and future secret help. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organized words just came to my lips, she found that Lucien’s line of sight moved down slightly, and looked at him steadily, seeing his own battle. A large group of wet marks on the skirt was very eye-catching, and the route that moved backwards, a long water trail reflected the faint light, and there was a water stain in the soft place. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teng's a moment, Sophia's face rose red, sweet smile is more ugly than crying, I only feel that my skin is so hot that I can fry eggs, simply shame dead. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How do I..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Too shame, too shameful! I am going Dead!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He doesn't have a gentleman's demeanor, bastard! Bastard!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road Xien has time to pay attention to Sophia's mood, but she is slightly funny. She used to be sultry, confident and elegant. She lost all her cards. When she was in a desperate environment, she would be so rude. If she changed to Natasha, she would definitely not move. Fight hard to counterattack, try to grasp the glimmer of hope, although no regrets. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s really no match! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of it, Sophia has just reached twenty, and there are already five levels of strength. This kind of thing is really enviable and not available. If the blood is top, the talent is outstanding, the promotion speed can be far more than most magicians, but most of the magicians are more than most of the knights. After all, not everyone has such a top blood, not everyone has it. The talent of horror, this is only a very small group of nobles - the ancient magician is to obtain a stable inheritance of a top blood, killing hundreds of thousands of humans, and for several generations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A light green and quiet aura opened, and after the death of the "Devil," a lot of aristocratic children relaxed and felt tired and could not restrain themselves from falling asleep, leaving Sophia unaffected. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time of spiritual recovery, Lucien left a warning magic on these noble children, and once they wake up or have other changes, they can I feel it right away. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take me to the Sun King's Chamber of Secrets." No time and perhaps the "painful" devil who has not completely disappeared to play hide and seek, Lucien said to Sophia. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey...good!" Sophia first glimpsed, then stood up and stood up, dare not hesitate, "This magician, you let me Nothing to do, as long as..."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the interruption, she suddenly did not know how to organize the language. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien nodded gently, using the voice of "Bolaq": "As long as you follow my instructions, and you die without it, I have not Interest in killing you, after all, we have no hatred in the past, now you will not snatch the 'treasure' with me, I will not stay in the empire in the future, right?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "Yes, it is easy to communicate with the wise magician!" Sophia ecstatically praised from the heart. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien laughed twice, as long as you can really finish my command and survive. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the road to the "dominant humans" Ralph took the lead to the Chamber of Secrets, Sophia dragged the sleepy Claire followed, Lucien Not falling slowly at the end, carefully sensing the aristocratic children behind him and Sophia, Claire, and Ralph in front of them, maybe they will suddenly become a "painful" devil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the Chamber, Ralph squatted down and pressed a gray wall tile slightly, then took out the silver dagger and cut his wrist. Let the blood pour in the corresponding ground stone bricks. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the more drops of blood, Ralph put his arms on the stone bricks, a faint milky white light flowing from the surface of his body into the stone Inside the brick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone bricks gradually bloomed with a splendid glitz, sucking the accumulated blood into it, silently condensing a door with a strange pattern on the wall. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After losing half of his vitality, the whole person looked languid and swayed, but under the control of Lucien, he still opened the door with difficulty. Take the lead in the second floor. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that there is no problem with Ralph, Lucien has searched it again with a peeping eye, and then took Sophia and Claire into the energy gate. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a spacious quaint hall behind the door, with a mural on the wall, the ground is covered with a magical array, and a line of lines gathers Above the center of the wonderful altar. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This altar is different from the sun altar in the inner layer of the palace, cast in dark and dark red, and inlaid with the mysterious pattern of the devil's horn On the sky above the altar, the ceiling hangs down a similar altar that is inverted, filled with a burning sun and a holy sun. On this altar, there is a magic wand with a huge sun stone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien slightly swept through the complex magical array and the altar, initially judging that they had the effect of imprisonment and extraction, and then guarded against Sophia and Relf Wait, watch the murals carefully. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more you look, the more surprised Lucine is, because the front part of the mural is very similar to the "Vicken's Special Summoning Ceremony": a man with hatred and hate The inexplicable ritual of drawing puppets, throwing puppets, burning puppets, summoned a devil with a shape that is inconsistent, and only two special sharp corners can judge its identity. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the murals make Lucien horrified, when this disgusting man is possessed by the devil, gaining powerful power and killing all the disgusted A magic circle that suddenly appeared around him, completely banned him, and then a middle-aged man wearing a magic crown appeared in the mural. He took a complicated gesture and extracted the devil projection from the man. ! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then this middle-aged man, like Tanos, opened the altar and dissipated the devil's projection and integrated it into himself! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
