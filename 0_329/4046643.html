			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Really not." Lucien admitted frankly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather Wei was silent for a while and seemed to be organizing the language: "I think the comments you gave are too high and will cause the arcaneists to rush and break away." The actual fantasy, although applying the electronically fluctuating surname to the new alchemy model, does allow some of the imposed quantization conditions to be naturally derived, but evaluates a hypothesis without any experiment and indication, and does not use the serious and realistic "There is a culture of the wind."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said something messy, but Lucien still barely understood, because the electrons can be regarded as waves can solve the current new alchemy Part of the problem, her assumptions about Dieppe are not as conservative and stubborn as I expected, and I have already made some psychological preparations. After all, for her, the perfection of the new alchemy is more important, and it is her future direction. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, she uses "fluctuated surnames" to describe electrons, not "electrons are waves," apparently attributed the problem to the special surnames of certain particles. Just as particle theory supporters interpret light quantum diffraction and interference images—although these conjectures are full of contradictions, none of them have been valued, but they do not prevent Hathaway from referring to similar ideas. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she really wants to refute is the comment given by Lucien, who thinks it’s too high, knowing that any bold assumptions that were previously unbelievable are due to certain problems and The discovery of vulnerabilities has related associations. For example, Lucien's optical quantum hypothesis is based on the fact that fluctuations cannot explain the photoelectric effect. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time Dieppe’s hypothesis is purely a product of broad ideas, pushing the wave-particles of the light to all microscopic particles. Is it true that the particles have to ask a question mark, and there is no indication that this is not its unique surname, how can it be rashly and blindly promoted in the particle world? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important thing is that this hypothesis only seems to be possible to solve the problems of the new alchemy, rather than clearly explaining the photoelectric effect as the photon hypothesis, even in Before the exact experiment, it also coincides with all the current experimental results. Therefore, for this hypothesis, Hathaway thinks that Lucien should not be evaluated so high, which will make other arcans specially put forward for the theory without any problems before. The assumption of complete divergence and fantasy makes the arcane atmosphere of rigorous exploration, practical research, and careful application completely ruined. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, she feels that Lucien’s slogan on Dieppe’s hypothesis will lead to a speculative surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather's language proficiency, all the members of the highest panelists in the field are very familiar, Oliver worried that Lucien did not understand the key points, but also added: " If you evaluate Dieppe's papers without any basis, it will make other arcans feel organic, because you can blame a classic theory error without any problem finding, and then proceed from this fantasy, using mathematical methods. Get a rigorous interpretation process, and how ridiculous the final result is, they can't control it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For example, I can blame you directly without evidence. The spy of the church, with this premise, I can rely on your actions, and then through a rigorous but selective derivation to prove that you published a subversive paper to explode more magician's head, or even directly Let us kill the members of the Supreme Council and achieve the purpose of eliminating the Magic Council. Don't you think this is ridiculous? Do you want to encourage such behavior?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&  ; Lucian very seriously said: "I got some inspiration from the assumption that electrons are waves, it seems to see the dawn of solving the new alchemy problem, which gives such a high evaluation, if this assumption can solve the new alchemy The problem of surgery, on the other hand, also confirmed it."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And, since photons can have fluctuating surnames, why can't electrons? Neutrons can't? Protons can't? In the microscopic field, this is a relatively hypothetical assumption, not a pure fantasy."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the arcane discussion, Lucien has The person who insists on himself cannot admit that he is too reckless because of the accusations of the two Arcanists. He admits that Dieppe’s paper is too bold and too practical, and the professional surname and authority surname that makes comments on himself are not Fair, unfair to Dieppe’s efforts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if you haven’t done the experiment, you will have the same persistence. If you can give this comment, you will have something to offer, but if it’s true, Being pointed out by a loophole, or having a rebuttal of experimental results, is not a stubborn person. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hathaway looked at the soul of the dead and said: "Whether you admit it, the photoelectric effect and the Brooke scattering experiment are there, clearly indicating everything."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" But I think that scattering experiments and so on may also have explanations for fluctuations, such as..." Oliver said his own ideas and built special waves that can represent the particle's surname. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas frowned: "There is no experiment or theory to support your idea."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp ;&nbsp; "This is not a direction." Brooke succinctly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a time, due to the dispute between volatility and particle theory, the entire highest comment The group meeting rooms became very noisy, and gradually, as the level of quarrels deepened, they even experienced emotional fluctuations. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Build your special composite wave first, let's talk about it, Oliver." When Klaus spoke, there seemed to be countless spots on the back, which made up the difference. The illusion of alchemy, there are demons, some people, there are floating cities, there are alchemy fortresses, there are magic steam trains...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oliver shakes his fingers: "Whether you How to look at it, this is also a way to explain the photoelectric effect and the Brooke scattering experiment. Moreover, before discussing my problem, you should revisit the particle theory, perhaps there are never any particles, they are all special reflections of the wave." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenes of destruction around him disappeared, and the conference room was dyed with a layer of scent. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the particles are waves, are the elements made up of these microscopic particles a wave? Are the life of these elements a wave? More precisely, we are Isn't it a wave?” Vicente did not agree with Oliver on this inference. He is the authority of the human body and the soul. Is it hard to believe that the body is a wave? How can a body with a real sense of touch be a wave? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black tombstone of Anning Yongmian seems to have grown one after another on the conference room carpet, and the silent death envelopes everything. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver waved his hand and signaled that he said this sentence was not rigorous enough. He said: "To be honest, although I appreciate the assumption of Dieppe, I also want to give He unveiled the high praise of the corner of the world, but at least so far, I still don't believe that the electronic will be a wave."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said while using magic, Directly constructed a scene of electronic movement in the cloud room, the pale mist of the droplet constitutes a wonderful electronic trajectory, full of dreams and shocking taste. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Electronics with such a clear particle trajectory, I am not so bold to believe that it is a wave, but since Lucien agrees with Dieppe’s hypothesis, Doesn't it also mean that he agrees that volatility is the essence of light?" While speaking, Oliver turned his attention to Lucien. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is taking the advice of Lucien to attack his own theory of light quantum. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I said, maybe the electrons can show fluctuating surnames in special circumstances, such as being tied around the nucleus." Hathaway stood at this time. Lucine’s camp. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen is a rare legendary magician who does not recognize the world's projections. She has been quietly listening to the arguments of wavers and supporters of particle theory. At this point, I couldn’t help but interject: "In fact, after the light quantum hypothesis was confirmed, I was very confused. Why does light have both a fluctuating surname and a particle surname? Will it be as high as Evans said? Look at this issue at a level?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It can be explained from the perspective of volatility..." Oliver once again emphasized his opinion, and he could become a great arcian, and ultimately adhere to. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing that the two sides are going to start a "candid and friendly conversation," Douglas quickly gestured to signal that they were quiet, and the visions in the conference room suddenly disappeared from the hellish scene. Changed back to the real world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The confrontation between volatility and particle theory has been going on for a long time, there is no need to delay today's time, since Lucien insists that his comments are no problem, they are not The results of the paper review, it seems that there is no need to discuss it again?" Douglas looked around everyone. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, is the electron a wave or a particle?" Vicente added coldly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather, Helen, and others also looked at Lucien, quite curious about his true arcane position. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the frequent occurrence of the vision, Lucien has been quietly watching this situation that is different from any scene, which is only possible when the highest panel is in a meeting. A unique landscape that appears. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, they heard their problems and felt the eyes of everyone. Lucien did not refuse to answer, but looked at the abnormal teacher with slight concern. Seriously ask: "What is a wave? What is a particle?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;En? The members present were at least the Arctic Arcticians. They didn't expect Lucien to ask the most basic concepts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lu Xien, this is not the time of the lecture, although your nickname is a professor." Oliver consciously and humorously. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vicente has only two dark red flames in his eyes, and only the thin skin with bones on his face makes it hard to see his True emotions: "The definition of waves and particles is mentioned in the basics of arcane books. Everyone's time is precious. If you don't want to answer, keep silent."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp "The wave is a phenomenon, originally defined from the various fluctuations in nature, and used in the study of arcane, the specific definition is..." Hathaway did not care about Vicente, the wave and particles The definition of the talk about it. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien smiled: "It can be clearly seen that the definition of waves and particles comes from us and comes from our real world that can be directly observed. Summary of experience."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's the problem?" Brooke crossed his fingers and crossed his knees, seemingly speculative. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas, the prophet Begner, and Hathaway seem to think of something, each with a thought-provoking expression, the difference is that Hathaway looks almost unchanged, if It’s hard to notice without looking at it, and the storm dominates Fernando’s silence. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien did not answer directly, but looked at the crowd: "If you don't feel wasted time, I want to tell a story first."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No problem." Oliver has always been tolerant of the story. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has spoken, and other members of the top panel will naturally not object to this trivial matter, and they believe that Lucien is definitely not telling stories indiscriminately to persuade everyone, certainly Have their own intentions, and then, the previous quarrels and doubts are based on the Arcane, not specifically for Lucien, can explain the problem clearly, what is the relationship between a story? It’s okay to talk about ten! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past, there was a king who got a dead dragon and was very happy to put it outside the palace as a symbol of his heroism. Every passer-by aristocrat and civilian can see it.” Lucian’s voice said gently, “One day, a group of blind people who didn’t know the dragon in the past heard about it, and it’s so funny what the dragon looks like. So I went to the palace and touched the body of the dragon."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing a group of blind people wanting to figure out the dragon by "touching" this action Look, Oliver, Klaus and other relatively cheerful members of the highest panel of judges all smiled, others guessed the results. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien continued to preach: "A blind person with the help of soldiers, touched the wings of the dragon, and immediately happy: "The dragon is a horror Big bat!'"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" 'No, the dragon is a big lizard!' Another blind person who touched the dragon scales shouted loudly, nothing Before dropping his eyes, he once caught a lizard and touched its scales."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest contributor when hearing the words of the first blind person Most of the members showed their expressions, but after the second blind person’s answer appeared, they all became dignified, and those who had speculation and psychological preparations such as Douglas and Hathaway nodded lightly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The rest of the blind people's answers, I don't want to talk more, I just want to ask, is the dragon a big bat or a big lizard?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucien smiled and said: "So, for me, light, electronics, etc. are neither waves nor particles. The only thing that can be confirmed is that they belong to matter. Of course, I prefer to use particles to call it."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not a wave, not a particle?" Oliver frowned slightly. "Do you want to say that they are actually something else?"<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked around the conference room: "We can't directly see the electromagnetic waves including visible light, nor can we directly see the particles in the microscopic field. Our research in these fields is like blind people. Therefore, we can only rely on observable phenomena, and we cannot blindly impose definitions and concepts of past experience summaries on them."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With light as an example, When we don't pre-load it with the concept of waves or particles, we can describe it like this. This material exhibits obvious fluctuating surnames, also has obvious particle surnames, frequency in what range, speed in various media. How much is it, as for having these What is the substance of matter? It is not the point. It can be defined as anything. As for why it shows the volatility or particle name, the volatility and the particle name are combined in it. The content of further research must be based on experimental results and real phenomena."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The reason we are arguing is to mechanically rigidly define the concepts and definitions of the past." Applied in the microscopic field, it is applied in the closest place to the real world. I once said that our experience will deceive us. This is one of the manifestations, and such deception is not only reflected in research, but also in our relationship with others. In the interaction."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, Lucien once again looked around the members of the highest-profile panel with different expressions, solemnly:<br />< Br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only by learning to temporarily abandon the original concept and firmly based on current phenomena and experimental results, we can 'see' the truth of the world in this microscopic world."<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the words of Lucien, there was a strange silence in the conference room, and each of them did not think the same. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is no original concept to study the micro world, experimental results and phenomena need to be processed and constructed into systems." Oliver agrees, but more Is questioning. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien simply said: "Mathematical tools."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know what it is, How do you know what mathematical tools you need to use?" Vicente did not agree. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The results of the experiments that can be directly observed can be applied to the previous concepts and definitions. If they are not directly observed, they can not be derived, but they can be derived from the experimental results. Putting forward guesses and assumptions, and then confirming them through rigorous experiments." Lucien explained his own point of view. This is due to the influence of strange things such as real world magic, soul, feedback, and the study of quantum theory. View. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So guessing that electrons are waves? But there is no rigorous experimental confirmation." Vicente continued, after a big lap, the topic returned. initial. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas gently nodded: "I think Lucien said that there is some truth. We see the same thing because the light is reflected into our eyes, zooming in. Magic is also based on the same optical principle, but light reacts with electrons, causing it to 'jump', which changes its state, so at least so far, we can hardly think of ways to directly observe the micro world, only by each The results of the experiments are summarized, from hypotheses or interpretations in induction, and when hypotheses or interpretations, too many original concepts cannot be substituted, which will bind our minds and blind our hearts."<br /><br / >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But no matter what, directly guessing that the electron is a wave is too far from reality, at least the current experimental results show no indication of this, without exception, showing the particle surname." Oliver shakes Shaking his head, Hathaway and others were slightly decapitated, agreeing with his views, at least the particle surname is an obvious experimental result, and it is difficult to let people think of the fluctuating surname from that vivid trajectory. <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, they also initially accepted the concept of blindly entering the original in the micro-world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Abandon the original concept to see the truth of the world?" Brooke sighed with a slight excuse, "You can learn arcane from an early age and accept various definitions." And the concept of us, in the study is likely to accidentally into the original concept without knowing it, and sometimes, sometimes, the introduction of the original concept will make things simple."<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I will try to reconstruct the new alchemy model with the concept of electron wave and give its wave function to see if it can solve the problem, so as to verify this hypothesis." Brooke is very interested in this direction and seems to have found it. Reshape the way you know the world. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver also nodded: "I will also put my own ideas into the concept of electronic waves, try to build its wave function, hoping to gain something. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heather did not express anything. When she could not speak, she always did not speak. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And "Death of the Soul" Vicente is taunting and laughing at the storm: "Old metamorphosis, why haven’t you been talking? Is it because it is your own? Student, so don't want to roar him in front of us? It's not like you who insist on the truth in the field of arcane."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said this, other top judges The members only woke up, and the storm master did not even speak! To know that this kind of controversy has occurred in the past, the conference room must be dominated by lightning, thunder, rain, and roaring. Is it so abnormal today? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm dominated Fernando as if he was suppressing something. After looking at Vicente, he looked at Lucien: "Get it out, they should be able to withstand such an impact." "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you take out?" Lucien was stupid. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What do you come up with?" Other top panel members are full of doubts. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fernando screamed: "When you give a comment, I know that you have finished the experiment! Come out, let us see what is called the world." Real! Look at what is called the concept of abandoning the original!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think we can't afford such an impact? Especially in the unknown!" <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete the experiment? Oliver, Klaus, and others looked at Lucian with horror. Is it really done? Doesn't that way of Sean's attitude mean... How is this possible? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the legendary magicians, such as Hathaway and Helen, showed a little shock and surprise, which made them angry, as if they are now There are flesh and blood. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douglas looked solemnly at Lucian: "If it's done, take it out, the people sitting here won't be so narrow and stubborn." Br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added that most of the fluctuations are supporters, while the small part is psychologically prepared because this assumption seems to solve some of the problems of the new alchemy. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien looked at them silently, got a consistent dagger, took a deep breath, took out a big single crystal, and arranged a magic array Let the image appear directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brook did not speak, raised his hand and fired a stream of electrons directly. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time seems to solidify in general, abnormal repression and silence, not long after, the magic array lights up, showing a classic like X-ray diffraction pattern Picture! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the eyes of everyone, this pattern is so familiar, such a dream, but it is so shocking, so unbelievable! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This..." I don’t know how many self-senses and unconsciousness came out. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boom! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countless lightning flutters, the sound of thunder is coming, black storms are over the sky;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp The surrounding black magnetic field is distorted, and the invisible electromagnetic waves are abnormally disordered;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars appear, emitting a ray of light, twisting the surrounding space, hanging down the gravitation ;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White, black, gold, silver, a little bit of elemental condensation, merged into a sea-like tide;<br /><br />&nbsp ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the quiet and restless place, black tombstones are placed obliquely on top, filled with a strong sense of death;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
