			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the big classroom, the silence is like a solidification, and the breathing sound seems to have disappeared. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Lucien opening the alchemy installation, there was a messy spot in the projection on the wall, and the confusion made it impossible to guess the next wave. Where will the specifics appear. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more and more spots, Heidi's mouth is too big, it is difficult to close, and a classic and beautiful interference pattern is reflected in the pupil. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspiratory sounds continue to sound, and the electronic volatility surnames no longer need to be suspected. This is not a simple particle group that can be explained by a certain probability distribution. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Electronic double-slit interference..." Douglas stood behind the big classroom and said to himself with a low voice. The result of this experiment is still within his tolerance. Inside. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than a year, the secrets of the immortal martyrdom, the great development of the microscopic field, and the results of experiments, let him and Fernando and others initially accept the probabilistic interpretation of electrons. I have a deeper understanding of the wave-particle two-like surname. The place they oppose Lu Xien lies in the fact that his quantum mechanics foundation is incomplete, and there must be deeper reasons for the ubiquitous probability of electrons. Surnames and uncertain surnames are the key to the problem, and there are also reasons why the microscopic realities are not mapped to macroscopic issues. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even so, when you see this familiar and intimate classic pattern, Douglas, Brooke, Oliver, Fernando and others can’t help but feel shocked. Quality, electric charge, and trajectory electrons can show such a purely fluctuating surname! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow of the dark and dark stripes, Lucien slightly sideways, pointing to the picture: "Maybe there will be many arcaneists who don't believe in themselves." Eyes, or suspect that my alchemy device has problems. If it is the latter, wait for the open class to come and check it. If it is the former, you don't have to doubt yourself. The experimental image that appears in front of us is the interference stripe without any doubt." <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If the electron is simply a particle with a fluctuating name, it will only pass through a gap at a time, presenting a simple superposition of two diffraction patterns, but unfortunately the experimental results Tell us not, this is a standard diffraction pattern, indicating that the electrons are either affected by the companions behind, or they pass through two gaps at the same time, and the self-realizes the interference, so the position on the screen will conform to the law of interference fringes. "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And these two reasons are undoubtedly manifestations of purely volatile surnames."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lu Xien’s voice is mellow Su, and not be slow, listen in the double-slit interference shocking images such as Larry arcanist ears as if through several of the world come, hazy but sacred. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact, I have already verified this aspect, after improving the experimental device and reducing the intensity of the source, only one electron is emitted at a time, and the electrons are worn in front. After the double slit reaches the sensing screen, the next electron is emitted, thus basically eliminating the possible surnames of the electronic interference and influence. After a long time of accumulation of light spots, the experiment also exhibits interference fringes!"<br / ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, the electron is indeed a probability wave, it permeates in space, everywhere, and passes through two gaps, self-interference!"<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella, Samantha and others are full of incredible colors, quality, electric charge, and trajectory electrons can pervade space, everywhere Is this still a substance? Is this still the basis of matter? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like this, why can we not be permeated in space, composed of microscopic particles, everywhere? Why can't you take a step and arrive at the holy city of Reims and the holy city of Aalto? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The micro-domain is also part of the world, and it is impossible for the Arcanists to associate themselves with micro-macro! <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen’s eyes focused on the experimental image, the index finger pressed on his cheek and fell into thought, due to the state transition and “immortality” that Lucien experienced "The martyrdom", the members of the highest judging panel are reluctant to accept this kind of probabilistic cloud state, and will not know that the world is broken or coagulated or explodes. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for other arcans, the research on the microscopic field is not profound enough, ignorant, and dare not build its own cognitive world. There was no large-scale headshot event, but even so, when I heard the description of the probability cloud, hundreds of arcanes showed a painful expression. They couldn’t imagine how they knew the electrons in the world in the state of standard particles. Will it be like that? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Probability clouds do exist, and the probabilities of electronic probabilities are not necessarily the essential surnames..." Samantha said to himself in pain, if the probabilistic surname is the electronic surname of the surname, the recognition probability is the essence of the world. That means that the decision has been a big problem, so she can only insist on herself for this reason. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, she also understands very well that in this state, there is no possibility of promotion to the legend! Don't even think about the Master! <br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The astrologers of the astral system mostly showed similar status. Fortunately, Lucien did not demonstrate an electronic double-slit interference experiment on the spot. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien put down the hand pointing at the wall and looked around the big classroom, calmly and fluently: "Because the experiment of launching only one electron at a time will be very time-consuming." I will not demonstrate it here. You can apply for the experimental equipment from the Atomic Research Institute and verify it yourself after queuing."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this regard, you can also Using the optical interference experiment to analogy, the required alchemy device will be much simpler, I believe that you can do it yourself in the laboratory."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien puts only one time A photon is completely described in the experimental design of the double slit: "After a long period of accumulation, you should be able to observe the interference fringes, that is, a single photon also has a surname of self-interference."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the Arcane masters are silent as if they were dead, as if they were afraid of such experimental results, and some of the Arcane divisions trembled a bit, and seemed to be eager to verify the design. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, Oliver spoke up: "Lusien, everything you said is based on the characteristics of electrons with wave-particle two-image surname, if It is only a pure wave. The particle surname is just a reflection of the wave packet. There is no such thing as a double-slit interference experiment and a single electronic self-interference. This is the essence of the wave, and at what scale the quantum superposition state will Exist, why not extend to the macro world?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why does the probability wave that you permeate in space suddenly collapse when you arrive at the sensor screen, becoming a certain Small point, no longer has a probabilistic feature?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His explanation makes the arcaneist who is biased towards the wave gently nod, in this respect, the previous experiment It is not so ridiculous and shocking. Fernando suddenly said: "Oliver, if electrons and other microscopic particles are pure waves, why do we not have a fluctuating surname? They are the same explanation. There is a problem of transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic field. Without the material characteristics of the particle surname, the wave will be attenuated!"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only insists on his own experimental results, The idea of ​​mathematical knowledge and the sublimation of the world's understanding will not be accepted by Oliver and himself as he believes that Lucian's theory is incomplete. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm dominated the question, and the arcane divisions who were biased were frowning. Before discussing light alone, it could be extended to electrons, protons, etc. Particles and material foundations will inevitably be linked to macroscopic materials, which is the most troublesome and most mysterious part. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the Arcanist and the Archmage are preparing to have a heated debate on this issue, Lucien lifted his hand and smiled and said: "About the electronic double-slit experiment I also have a follow-up verification."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? Oliver, Nesika and others look to Lucien, what follow-up? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien pointed to the alchemy installation: "We can add recorded magic items to the two gaps, and observe that the electrons passed at the same time. Gap, self-interference, or just passed one of them, I will adjust the different alarm sounds, so that everyone can clearly distinguish whether the electrons pass the left gap, or the right gap, or both pass."<br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While describing, Lucien took out a record-type magic item display, convincing everyone that there is no extra magic array, only the function of recording and sounding an alarm. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arcane divisions had a heated discussion while waiting for him to install the recorder. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Annick, according to the teacher's description, should the two recorders emit different alarms at the same time?" Heidi asked about his own eyes in the microscopic field. Outstanding talented Annick. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
