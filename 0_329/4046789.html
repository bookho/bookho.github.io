			<div id="content"><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lei Riya took two copies from a thick stack of journals: "The hot topic of discussion this month is the teacher's "mathematical basis" The most attention is the hairdresser's paradox, which is called the big crisis in the field of mathematics."<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although under the guidance of Lucien, she also She is good at mathematics, but in essence she is an arcane master in the field of elements and alchemy. The application of mathematics is more than research, so when it comes to the "major crisis in the field of mathematics," she is not as anxious as the towering arcanist. Looks like it, but a little more to see the excitement of the excitement. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lu Xien took over "Arcane" and "Nature" and found that the Archdiocese, the teacher, Hathaway, and other arcanists are all dedicated to the "mathematical basis" "Writing the thesis, on the one hand, fully affirmed the important role of "Mathematics Basis" in the development of mathematics and mathematics, and did a lot of research on the many mathematical branches thus formed. On the other hand, they all pointed out that the hairdresser The solution of public opinion must rely on the development of set theory itself, relying on the strictness of it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although before Lucien wrote Mathematical Basis, magic There is no thoroughly formed collection theory system in the parliament, but many archaeologists who are good at mathematics have realized that from the set theory, combined with other concepts, the entire mathematical palace can be established. It is the cornerstone of all mathematical achievements, so not only The Arcanists hope to retain all the valuable content of the current set theory while strictly defining the avoidance of public opinion. The other Gaota Arcanists' papers also reflect this view. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, their papers have different tendencies, and some of the arcans are mathematically equivalent to logic, with Douglas and Hathaway. For the representative, another part of the arcane masters believes that mathematics can be a completely formal symbol system, without having any real content, as long as they are not contradictory, they can be studied. This radical view is represented by Fernando, Lucy. En's axiomatization system concept also belongs to this category. In addition to this, there are other tendencies. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these tendencies belong to their own worldviews and values. It’s hard to judge who is right. Whoever is wrong, they all promote the development of mathematics. It is only how much there is in promotion. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It seems that the Arcanists are not intimidated by the barber's public opinion, but they are full of motivation to study how to solve this problem." Lucien laughed. . <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heidi, Cherie, etc. quietly whitened the teacher and said that the barber's public opinion is not what you proposed. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After turning over, Lucien saw the paper by the prophet Bergner about the "Goldbach conjecture", and he admitted that there is no way to prove it at the moment. It is believed that it can be approached step by step. First prove that the even number can be expressed as the product of m prime numbers plus the product of n prime numbers, that is, first prove that "mh· when both m and n are reduced to 1, the problem is solved.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Teacher your guess is dubbed the proof 'Lr1, it feels very interesting, but Lord Bergner even 'qh9, have not proved that distance is still solved Very far away. Heidi said with a smile, "Teacher, you will not have solved this conjecture, and then you will throw out the look of everyone thinking about it?" "<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I really didn't solve it..." Lu Xien shook his head with a funny smile, and seemed to be able to imagine that in the future "Nature" journals would be indispensable "mh" Papers - Maybe someone can go to "12" in a few decades...<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To exchange the latest journals, Lucien is preparing to enter his office, the sea Tidy suddenly smiled: "Teacher, I heard that the Kingdom is about to hold a Rentata Music Festival. Is the opening ceremony your opera "Women"?"<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If there is no accident, it should be like this." Lucian did not deny. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, look forward to it!" Heidi, Lei Yi Liya and other students and assistants all said with a bright voice, these teachers, most of the years The energy is placed on the study of arcane and magic. In addition to the classic alternative violin concerto, there are only a few simple and short piano pieces and light music, which really makes them people who like big musicians lose. This opera is said to have been written by the teacher for several years. It must be perfect, with many classic melodies and arias. <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splint sneaked a sigh of relief. Can't understand their attitudes. He doesn't care if he listens to music. Is it so exciting? <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
